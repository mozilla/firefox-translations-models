Civil rights groups issue travel warning against Missouri
Because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the NAACP issued a travel warning to people of color who were preparing to travel to Missouri.
“The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which went into effect on August 28, 2017, calls for the near-event of a series of suspected racial incidents in Missouri that all African-American travelers, tourists, and Missourians should be treated with the utmost care and care when traveling in Missouri, and are hereby notified,” the group’s statement said.
The NAACP noted that a recent Missouri law has made it harder to win discrimination lawsuits, and that the state’s enforcement has targeted minorities in a certain degree, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were interrogated, beaten or killed because of their skin color,” Rod Chaper, president of NAACP, Missouri, told The Kansas City Star.
“We have received an unprecedented number of complaints.”
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The group cited racial slurs of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tennessee male Tory Sanders.
Earlier this year, Sanders died under suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was detained by Missouri police on charges of a crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office showed that “black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be investigated for parking compared to whites.”
“The purpose of the consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” says Chappell.
“People need to be prepared, whether they’re taking bail to Missouri or letting their relatives know they’re traveling in the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; the state ranks 16th in the nation based on the number of crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which would make it more difficult to prosecute businesses for housing or employment discrimination.
The move comes after states passed immigration enforcement laws that require local law enforcement to detain immigration violators, a move the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issue travel advisories targeting Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have taken this approach in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
After experiencing the "golden age" of the box office surge in 2015, the overall film market in 2016 entered a cooling-off period, and whether it can break through the total box office results of 44.069 billion yuan last year have become a suspense.
According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in October, the prices of new and second-hand houses in Beijing cooled down, rising only 0.6% and 1.1% month-on-month.

The BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: making foreigners feel "living in a new era"
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that Beijing may have a long history of three thousand years, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern charm city.
With an amazingly fast Internet, with cutting-edge technologies such as facial recognition software, a huge investment in artificial intelligence and an unrivalled international energy, it is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are exploratory.
According to the BBC website on January 16, the German expatriate Clemens Sesch said, "If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere else." He quoted singer Frank Sinatra singing the lyrics of New York City.
Søsch, who is creative director of Traveler Archive magazine, said, "If Sinatra had lived to this day, he would probably have sung a city like Beijing." He said that living in the city will make you feel "living in the new era" and always keep up with the trend.
Simon Norton, who lives in England but recently lives in Beijing, wrote on his personal blog 4 Corners7Seas: "People generally have a feeling that is at the center of something big, and it's hard to say, but it leaves many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it's going to be like, and they want to see it for themselves."
The city’s high-quality, high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever.
Andy Penia Fuerte, from Manila, who is currently the deputy editor of the Beijing Children website, said: “Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, and the Internet has integrated the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions.”
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing’s technological ambitions, facial recognition software is already widespread, with many mobile apps using it for bank transfers and payments, giving people access to apartments and offices, and even using it to verify the identity of drivers.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park, which will be completed by more than 400 companies, and they will focus on developing various artificial intelligence technologies from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also the core of many major festivals in China over the years, and participating in these celebrations is respected by foreigners, and the Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival, and it is also one of the easiest festivals for foreigners to participate in.
"I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning the apartment and putting a New Year's greeting on the door of the red Spring Federation, which is as important as the New Year's Eve, when all family members gather for a big, heart-to-be, and then stay until midnight to welcome the New Year with gorgeous fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity to integrate," Seshi said.
The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but China’s language barriers and the ease of communication among the diaspora can easily become an excuse for not fully integrating into the local culture.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for years, but they have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempts to reach out to the Chinese are not successful, then it's easy to feel more comfortable with other foreigners," Sehy said.
In these so-called "foreign bubbles" ("foreigners' bubbles" mean that foreigners only mix among foreigners, not contact with locals and local cultures, foreigners gather in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only foreigners.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin – it’s easier than one might think.
“One or two hours a week of private Chinese lessons or an entry-level radio drama should be a busy schedule for everyone,” Sehy said.
Even learning a few classic phrases can help with shopping, ordering meals at restaurants, or chatting in a taxi.
Recalcitrant air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, but in recent years the government has worked to curb some of the problems.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities in warmer months, which are often lighter in pollution, as opportunities to wander around historic huts or explore popular kitas.
“Beijing is the Chinese city that can spot the most things below the surface, and you can find great art and music activities, nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and old hutongs,” Norton said.
According to the report, the impact of aging on human capital growth is becoming increasingly obvious, especially in the Northeast, the average annual contribution of aging to human capital growth is -2.82%.

BEIJING, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- The 2016 China Ancient Painting and Painting Identification, Restoration and Protection International Summit Forum opened at Renmin University of China on December 17.
The European Commission accused Google in April of forcing mobile phone makers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google apps.
The European Commission believes that this is detrimental to the interests of consumers and hinders competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If convicted, Google faces a fine of up to 10 percent of its global revenue, about $7.4 billion.
Google did not immediately comment on this.
Google is also facing EU investigations because of its bias in search results to its own shopping service.
Zhang Yuning's stay in the ocean is real, it can be said that he achieved the "jumping level" from the national youth to the national Olympic Games is not accidental, and his leap forward growth is still surprising.
A picture to understand: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
In addition to the price correction naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the collapse of this round of digital currency is also related to the "enemy" - regulatory risk.
From the visual map, the attitude of Eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, and the countries that account for the majority of the world are still waiting for the legitimacy of digital currency, which represents the "black swan risk" is still very large.
*This article is from Wall Street News (WeChat ID: wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more information, please visit wallstreet.com, or download the Wall Street News app.*
With the regulatory storm in major bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, and the global digital currency led by Bitcoin has been bloody this week, and the price of Bitcoin fell below the psychological integer bit of $10,000 on Tuesday, and the largest one-day decline in three years.
In addition to the price correction naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the collapse of this round of digital currency is also related to the "enemy" - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the visual big data website HowMuch.net has produced an atlas showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of Bitcoin in countries around the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, although it has not yet publicly legalized Bitcoin status, but there is no major restriction on use; pale pink represents the restricted market, that is, the local government tries to use the digital currency through red line policy or regulation; dark pink represents the country that is defined as Bitcoin illegal; gray is the country that has not yet commented.

The article pointed out that from the distribution of green blocks in the figure, it can be seen that the attitude of Eastern countries to Bitcoin in the traditional sense is more conservative than that of the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that has not yet issued relevant policies for Bitcoin.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, where the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, and the color block distribution in these regions is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are the legal bitcoin market, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and other countries have some degree of restrictions on their trading and use, more Latin American countries have not yet voiced their views on Bitcoin.
According to the above data, 99 of the 246 countries in the world are excluded (or 40%) without restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin, that is, green and orange.
Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (light pink), 10 (or 4%) define Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53%) do not yet have more information about digital currencies (grey).
This shows that the countries that account for the majority of the world (53%, more than half) are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency led by Bitcoin in China, and also represents that the “black swan risk” of Bitcoin is still very large, because some of these countries may eventually make legislative decisions to restrict the digital currency.
The article believes that global regulators do not fully understand the emerging category of digital currency, which may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a statement.
Although Bitcoin’s “beverage” has grown exponentially since last year, it does not mean that all countries are interested, and some countries may be worried that local fiat currencies will be threatened as a result, or more worried about the digital currency being used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of the international regulatory news against bitcoin since last week, including China’s crackdown on centralized online platforms and mobile apps for over-the-counter exchanges, South Korea is still considering closing digital currency exchanges, and the European Union’s belief that bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warned investors about the risk of “losing money.”
Read the editor-in-chief's "Reading News | 2018: The world's central mother opened the first year of digital currency?" once mentioned that from any point of view of supervision, acceptance/criticism and adoption, 2018 will become the first year of digital currency for global central banks.
The criticism of bitcoin’s legitimacy by big powers such as Russia is also to make way for the official issuance of digital currency.
Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, January 8 (Reporter Xie Yuzhi) Barcelona's new aid Coutinho debuted for the first time in the Barcelona shirt at Camp Nou on the 8th.
Coutinho passed Barca's medical examination that morning and signed with Barca president Bartomeu on a contract that expires in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared as a Barcelona player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at Camp Nou.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho's total transfer fee may reach 160 million euros (1 euro is about 7.77 yuan), which is the first value in the history of Barcelona club and La Liga.
Because Coutinho is still injured, he still needs to rest for nearly 20 days to usher in his Barcelona shirt debut.
What else is sacred?
Now Trump’s White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most certain sign of regime change was when they began attacking statues.
Americans, like anyone else, agree. So Saddam Hussein in Baghdad’s Paradise Square was orchestrated in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration’s key thinkers, is sure to know what will happen to the Statue of Liberty by cutting out a symbolic axe at the president’s proposal for strict restrictions on legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, then a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would surely devour him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was engraved on the pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built in the next 17 years).
As Miller rebuked Acosta, “I don’t want to talk about the whole truth of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.”
The poem you're referring to, which was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
In fact, Miller was right, but as he himself put it, it wasn’t really about history.
This relates to the modern echo of Lazarus, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: “Your tiredness, your poverty, or your crowding of people long to breathe freely, / Suffering people reject your crowded beaches.”
There is no “suffering man who refuses” at a moment when our screens become more glaring.
Miller, who has not worked in literary criticism, has made it clear that these people would not be welcome in Trump-era America.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually in conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends who had engraved her verses on the pedestal at an event after her death, were clear that the behavior they were involved in was highly political.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the connection between French and American republicanism through ancient classical metaphors that serve as the feminine incarnation of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poems, the female image is no longer abstract, she wants to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: Mother of Exile.
The combination of the poem and the painting is a successful feminist coup d’état and a devastating blow to American nativism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right wing has always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, a baptist who came to Trump in 2010 believed that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and he was now an early neoconservative who brought the flame of American wisdom to the world of ignorance: “The Statue of Liberty is ahead of its time.
She meant to bring the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not a light on America's path.”
Unusually, Limbaugh was actually struck by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive perspective.
Lazarus' imaginative approach was to be able to see it. When weary, poor but hopeful people would be able to see it on the deck of the ship after a long and often terrifying journey.
On the surface, this involves the perspective of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them and needs the hope and welcome they hear.
Of course, this is not the view that Miller and Trump once wanted to admit.
They are not torches to light roads, but to ignite hatred from their only source of strength.

World Championships 2017: Neil Black highly praises Scottish players in the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scots in the British national team.
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said the 16-strong Scots team in the World Championships group would make a "significant contribution to the national team".
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which opened on Friday, is the highest in history.
Black believes that "Scotland is making extraordinary progress" and that British track and field athletes must learn from it.
“We accept and try to understand that, and we will stick with it until we succeed,” Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute. They think it's something to do with what they're doing.
Scottish track and field athletes believe this has to do with what they do.
The British Athletics Association believes this is related to their actions.
Even the street people think so.
Whatever the case, it's brilliant."
A number of Scottish track and field athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be one-size-two at the 5,000m and Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle will be selected as captains.
“Irid is a bit modest.
Her captain’s speech was incredible,” Black said.
“Many track and field athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, live or train, are proud to walk out the door.
The passion and true feelings that Erid naturally put in was very good.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at its fifth world championship, said it was "incredible" to have 16 Scots in the UK national team.
Previously, the number of Scottish track and field athletes participating in the World Series was up to seven, that is, the number of participants in 1983 and 2015.
Muir is the leader. She has set five UK and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5000m.
Chris O’Hare, who competes in the 1500m, is another Scottish player to watch, having previously achieved good results in the UK national qualifiers and the Olympic anniversary.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was proud that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases also challenged medals to reach the final.
"What's special about being a captain of the national team is that it's voted for by the rest of the team. So knowing that your team-mates voted for you for a very unusual achievement, it's a great honour for me anyway," she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are all veteran track and field athletes here, and they are about to advance towards the purpose of winning the podium.
How did my captain speak?
Well, I think it's great.
I just refer to the fact that in this case we are very lucky because we are holding the World Championships at home.
So it really mattered that we got our support at home and grown up with our return to the Olympic Stadium.
I'll get a second chance to play, and the atmosphere there will be a wonderful place."

Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can't stand the blame of voters, don't run for public office
Our father-in-law understands the bad media style.
Americans loved Washington, but soon after, the major newspapers began to lash out at everything he had, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was irritated by these criticisms, no doubt.
But he did not silence these critics.
As early as 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech is denied—we will be slaughtered in silence and ignorance like lambs.”
It reminds me of Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and removed the posts of at least 450 people because they posted their views on his Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor’s staff thought the lawsuit was sloppy, with online reports rife with their strong resistance: “Who cares?”
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But that is important.
This is especially important because it is the case with people like Hogan.
He is a Republican governor in a predominantly Democratic state, and he is also surprisingly popular.
Of the 50 governors in the country, he received the second highest praise.
Hogan is not a reactionary impetuous man.
He was in control of Maryland and strictly adhered to the rules.
He is also very good at using Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, jokingly showing his baldness after chemotherapy on the homepage for the first time.
So blocking people who come to the governor's homepage for comment is completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous. This home page is a public forum, the official management platform advertised by the public tax-provided staff.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman, Amelia Shas, defended the governor’s actions, saying she believed blocking their comments was nothing more than a attempt to restrain them.
But they have too hastily described it as a flood of beasts or cynics sweeping the web.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: they are teachers, small business owners, and pastors, not a flood of beasts.
They have expressed their depth, respect, and indiminency.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Raxemi Salma Lamani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in a news story commentary section of The Washington Post, “I am politely commenting that I am disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events.”
I also don’t like a bunch of people commenting on the same topic, because they are directly ignored by some people who think they are so-called herd mentality, rather than treating them as a group of worried citizens.”
What the governor’s staff called “intensive spam bombardment” may have been “insisted claims” to others.
The Facebook era made it easy to change a message, simply blocking one critic or removing one negative comment.
And it’s far cleaner than it used to be, and to do the same thing in the past, it would have required sending staff out to collect and burn critical newspapers or arrest or silence protesters.
But that’s really what’s happening now, but on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for suing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
Last week saw a landmark ruling in Virginia on such issues.
According to District Judge James C. Catsari of Alexandria, the chairman of the Lawden County Oversight Committee’s blocking of voters from her Facebook page violates the First Amendment.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) is also patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so difficult.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had similar influence.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters were written as critical of his leadership.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous flood of beasts against him.
People used pseudonyms such as Yurikra, Valerius, Belisarius, and Poius to write harshly to criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper online project, his office was inundated with petitions criticizing his attitude to the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America.
But he didn’t silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech are the foundation of this country.
Real leaders need to accept this.
The breeze of the property market is touching people's sensitive nerves.
The purchase restriction is a hard line in many urban real estate regulation and control policies.
In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations that undergraduates can enjoy the same purchase policy of local permanent residents for half a year;
In June, Wuhan issued a policy that stipulates that college students can settle down with a graduation certificate and employment certificate within three years of graduation.
Subsequently, the policy was increased, and the official said that "college students can buy a house below the market price of 20%."
In July, Chengdu issued regulations that young talents with bachelor's degree or above at foreign universities can apply for settlement in Chengdu with a graduation certificate.
In addition, Kunshan, Shanghai Lingang and other cities or regions have also introduced the "talent introduction" related policies, the talent to buy a house to reduce the threshold.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually the competition of major cities for the population, especially talents, to retain the population, especially talents, and the city is competitive, which is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some people even think that this means that the time has come to cancel the "restriction" of the property market.
The director of Er Dongsheng said on the same day that the filming plan has a long history, the first adaptation of the script was in 1999, and even prepared to find Jincheng Wu to play Yan Thirteen.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to enjoying the feeling of coming home at the Renaissance club
The East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish Evergreen Open, and former European champion Ronan Lafferty will enjoy the feeling of returning home for the next three days.
The Northern Irishman led the next-door Archerfield Linkes to the final last year, but lost to Paul Ills. He now works for the new venue, serving as tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Salvati.
Lafferty said: “I have witnessed the establishment of the Renaissance Club and we will witness its glory through this competition.
Athletes will see the best look and the best of this course.
Jerry has created this place incomparably.
He is a passionate advocate of this competition and is very proud of what he has achieved here.
This is the best stage to show this course."
Ills, the Englishman, is looking forward to defending for the first time, although in a 32-year career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
The Southport athlete said: “It’s really special.
I didn’t defend the Extremadura Open because the match was cancelled the year I won.
It feels amazing to be here,
Golf is great here.
Last year’s memories came up, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year’s win was of special significance to us.
It's a real memory, and we'll remember it forever."
Back in his native competition was Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year and then played on the European Evergreen Tour.
This is his first Scottish competition since the 2013 Scottish Open.
Helensburg Orr said: "There will always be more meaning in the game back home.
You want to do it well; but you can feel the extra pressure.
To be able to play again I really enjoy, I’ve been playing golf.
I am very pleased with the current situation.”
Joining the three-on-court duo were former Masters winner Ian Woucnan and Evergreen winners Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNetti.
There are six Scottish athletes on the field, with Ol and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance being two, along with four others for Andrew Oderkone, Stephen McAllister, Bill Langmu and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, with parking for £5 per vehicle carrying one passenger and £10 per vehicle carrying two or more passengers.

Zou Choumin, director of the Environmental Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, introduced in Beijing on the 22nd that in August, a total of 57 cases of continuous punishment were implemented nationwide, and the newly revised "Environmental Protection Law" implemented at the beginning of this year significantly increased China's environmental law enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection organs around China can use punishments such as daily continuous punishment, seizure and seizure, production restriction and production reduction, and transfer of administrative detention to investigate and punish environmental crimes, and cooperate with judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.
Zou said that in August, a total of 335 cases of seizure and seizure were carried out in various parts of China; 177 cases were closed and discontinued; 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred, and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred.
Among them, Henan implemented 7 consecutive penalties per day, and at present, China is being controlled from the end to the whole process to fully strengthen environmental pollution control.
Although the downward pressure on the economy has shown, the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China has previously clearly stated that China should correctly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development, enhance the "green concentration", and the more the economic growth rate is down, the more it cannot relax environmental protection and play a good role in optimizing environmental protection for the economy.

Russian media said that Putin will have a new domestic car: the unit price is 15% cheaper than Mercedes-Benz
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that Russian media said that Russian Industry and Trade Minister Manturov said that the unit price of President Putin's "caravan" began from 6-7 million rubles.
The budget goal is to keep the price at 15% below the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.
According to the Russian Liantao network reported on January 16, from the end of February to the beginning of March, the main research and development unit of the presidential car, the Russian National Institute of Automotive Engineering (NAMI), will deliver 16 vehicles to the Federal Guard Bureau.
According to the report, the "carcavan" project requires the use of a unified module platform to build three kinds of cars - long cars, hatchbacks and minibuses - for the country's top person. The budget for the project is 12.4 billion rubles.

Not only to change the hardware, but also to keep up with the software.
The tourism department requires that the toilets in the scenic spots should be equipped with toilet paper and hand sanitizer.
But in some areas.
Is it because of the uncivilized behavior of an individual to stop this convenience service?
Managers everywhere make a choice.
On the one hand, it advocates conservation through civilization tips, and on the other hand, it is also undergoing technological innovation.
Public toilets in Nanjing, Sucheng and other places in Jiangsu
Brush your face for three seconds and get a free copy of toilet paper, but if you want to get a double copy, you need to wait another ten minutes.
Avoiding the misuse of public resources
Habit, some tourists may indeed want to take the paper back, but on the other hand, we also have to reflect.
There is no paper left in the next toilet that we tourists are going to enter, so this is what we particularly emphasize in the new three-year plan.
We need to solve this imbalance.
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what the masses think.
There must be a third bathroom to facilitate the family to accompany the elderly and children to the toilet.
We brought the baby, the men's toilet we were embarrassed to accompany in.
The girl toilet child is so small as to know a little embarrassing, the board is particularly comfortable, it is convenient for us to bring children.
While people feel the civilization, they also become builders of civilization. In the countryside, villagers in Guangxi River Pool are building new flush toilets at home.
Actively promoting the toilet revolution can not only help people stay away from diseases, but also drive economic development to narrow the regional development gap.
This toilet problem is a stand-up problem and a node in the development of social problems.
It is a national civilization project, from the national point of view to guide the layout, and then from different degrees of participation to solve small social problems.
This completes all our weaknesses.

Her wooden house is located in Enarotali, the capital of Panai County in Indonesia’s Papua province, and the housewife usually puts just a sweet potato — which locals call “nota” — directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the charred sweet potato was taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and eaten.
Dai Jie sat on the mud—she had no furniture, and it was where she did her daily household chores, such as washing clothes, and the water for washing clothes was very turbid, all from the nearby marshes.
There was a bucket in a room without a roof, which was the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband’s four wives, so she was not assigned to the field to take care of her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working until the party was very dangerous: most of the men in the village did not have a job, and many were drunk, plus there were many soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m."
It is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the Papuan Highlands, once a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after a referendum in 1969, but the referendum was also controversial when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the army that occupied the area.
The current campaign to demand independence and opposition to Dutch rule soon took aim at the Jakarta government, which imposed heavy-handed rule on the region and isolated foreign journalists and activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea controlled the eastern part of the island independently.
Ana Rotali is remote and uninhabited; to get here, you need to take a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Chaiapura, to Napierre, and then rent a car for 5 hours, all the way to the stomach.
There is no public transportation here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden house is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the folded tin roof is a tawny cover made of rust.
Few Indonesians came, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian evangelists, the Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here too.
Dai Jie said, "We can't wear these clothes." She was referring to her brightly colored hand-knitted turban, dark shirt and bright half-dress.
"We used to cover our bodies with only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and is the region with the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate.
It is also the Golden Continent of Indonesia.
Panai County is located in the highlands, about the same size as New Jersey, and has 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grassberg, is located just 60 miles from the Phoenix-based Felipe McMurran Copper and Gold Company.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mines.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these abundant resources are also the source of the Papuan tragedy, and Indonesia's powerful military forces have been able to suppress them.
A 2005 New York Times investigation found that Philip paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, and an official alone was as high as $150,000.
The Papuans’ growing demands for independence threatened the gold owner and were brutally treated.
Since 1969, more than half a million Papuans have been killed and thousands raped, tortured and detained by Indonesian forces, according to activists.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the Papua tribal highlands of the 1970s have escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane, We Will Lose Everything, included evidence of the previous year’s manifests, such as extrajudicial killings, torture – another report says rape and electricity are particularly prevalent – and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
Andreas Halsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch, said, “Violence is taking place on a daily basis, making it difficult to calculate the number of victims.”
Papua’s resources attracted large numbers of immigrants outside of Indonesia, and the oppression began.
Eighty-three percent of the province's 3.5 million people are Christian, but the demographics of Muslim economic immigrants have changed since the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
The Javanese food stand sells a mixture of fried chicken and vegetables, with peanut butter.
The locals are struggling.
Apos You, a 24-year-old local, moved to Chayapura, the provincial capital, to find work, explaining that “those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans.”
This caused the local Papuans, the Papuan women (mama-mama) – to lose their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo (often referred to as Jokowi) vowed at his 2014 election campaign to address Papuan inequality and abuse of power.
The former carpenter’s road to Jakarta’s presidential palace was supported by 27 of all 29 districts – including Panai.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today, the locals feel betrayed.
“We have broken our hearts and we voted for Jokowi in 2014 in the hope that he will fulfill our wish and restore fairness.”
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Panai suffered his worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Ana Rotali were singing a Christmas carol in front of a bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers rushed over on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yahweh Tebay, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses said the drunken soldiers chased the children with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers fired a gun at the children.
Sixteen-year-old Julianus Yemme was unconscious after being badly beaten.
A few hours later, a blaze ignited in the building of the nearby government agency Election Commission, and the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football stadium in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
With ritualistic bows, they danced the waita dance of the Babuya Mee Pago tribe—running around in circles and mimicking birdsong.
Some protesters began throwing stones at regular military checkpoints.
According to an official document seen by Time magazine, as the mood continued to intensify, the soldiers received an order via internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them immediately." But the document was not released to local media.
Jeremias Kayamu, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighbourhood of Ana Rotali, felt that there was imminent danger, called for calm and begged them to go home.
No one was in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house and told Time magazine, "When I turned around, my left wrist was suddenly shot."
Kayami still did not know who fired the gun, but he said the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
He added, "It was crowded, they fired a lot of shots."
According to the cousins of Orfyus Juul, he witnessed the shooting and saw Orfyus Juul shot three times.
Yuhanes sadly told Time magazine, “I ran over to check if his body was him,
I found out he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua police chief inspector Yuji Mend told reporters that his subordinates were only "protecting" the police station because the police station was attacked.
In 2015, Papua police spokesman, Police Chief Puzio Suristior, said: “When someone threatens to kill us, we have to defend ourselves.
It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The next day news of the killing only spread slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a speech in Jayapura, expressing deep sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuses left over from Papua’s history.
He said, “I hope this case will be resolved as soon as possible, so that this will not happen again in the future.”
In October 2016, Security Minister Wilando said he wanted to set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse of disbar was almost immediately invoked.
He said, “Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but it still requires a process.”
Then in Jakarta on June 5, Wilando, in a conversation with Time magazine, said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
On the contrary, he said, “Everything will be settled in accordance with the law”.
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Wilando for “crimes against human rights” over more than 1,000 deaths in a bloodied independence vote in East Timor in 1999, but said 11 human rights violations in Papua have been resolved, including the Panai incident.
The families of the victims of the Panai incident scoffed at these words.
“I’ve had four interviews in the last three years, but things haven’t gone well,” Juhanes said.
Years later, he said, "I'm tired."
He is still living in fear.
He said, “I’m scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yukabus also believed that the people of Panai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
He said, "After the body was buried, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in De Yai County, Panai neighboring county.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a comatose man to the hospital, where clashes ensued, one person was killed and another 17 injured, including children.
Rajanus Dow, a 24-year-old man who was fishing in the nearby river, drowned on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's on-site office.
Police said villagers threw stones at police, so officers fired warning shots.
But the riot mobile unit (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, and one person was killed.
Domingu Badi, 29, told Time magazine, “We were all panicked and now we’re afraid they’re going to get revenge.” He was living near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being rushed to the hospital.
"I hid at home for two days."
The Deyai parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and the withdrawal of riot mobile forces from the area.
Panai has always been a rightful place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fostered the discontent of the people of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, scattered in the lush central highlands of Panai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel group that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans through scattered attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papuan Movement were born in Panai, including Tadius Yug and Daniel Yodas Kogoya.
As a result, thousands of Panais have been arrested and deliberately detained in recent years under the guise of “maintaining national sovereignty” by the military.
Some have not appeared again.
In the eyes of the Papuans, Panai is a “place of forgotten tragedy.”
Poverty breeds discontent.
Ana Rotali sells so little rice that the locals simply can’t afford.
Bread is out of reach.
Here the people grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leaves of vegetables.
Farming is a woman’s job, and every woman can take care of four or five pieces of sweet potato land.
They usually keep most of the harvest for writers, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been drawn up among local Papuans and new immigrants, and the number of these migrants has increased significantly since the opening of the new route to Napierre Airport.
The small number of jobs available often falls into the hands of better educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans have little capital or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
John Goby, president of the Parnian Tribal Council, said that “young people do not want to stay in this village ... because there is no work and no money”.
Papua is isolated.
Restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Longchamp were expelled from Papua because they “do not cooperate with the relevant agencies,” even though they have received rare authorizations for filming.
According to Felim Kane, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s election pledge to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been fulfilled.
“If foreign journalists try to cover the most popular provinces in Indonesia, Papua and West Papua, the easternmost provinces, they are at new risk: denial of visas and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The absence of media scrutiny means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua’s neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands — asked the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate “all kinds of widespread human rights violations,” including the Panai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement .
The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Almanata Nasir, was concerned about the allegations against the group, telling reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia is still in its democratic institutions and the media is free, so the evidence of human rights violations is difficult to conceal.”
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention.
On May 4, when the Dutch ambassador for human rights, Keswan Barr, led a delegation of officials to Jayapura, the local people broke their silence and begged for “we want freedom.” He also attended the meeting, but requested anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote in Jokowi again.
Goby, the chairman of the tribal council, said: “Zokowi’s intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Panai shooting.”
He wanted Jokowi to know that the people of Panai not only lived under the threat of a greedy army, but that there was nothing but that the region was little educated and public health care services were scarce.
Gobai said the Panai people, like other Papuans, believed that the vote they had voted for Jokowi was a debt he had to pay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panai shooting made their last symbolic revolt: the body of a victim buried opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won’t let the culprits forget their crimes.
Yukabus said, “My family was killed.
What else can we do?”

Samsung Electronics on Tuesday released the first set of components for self-driving cars jointly developed with Harman International, as well as infotainment solutions, which is an important move for the company to enter the car electronics market.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.
At this week’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Samsung unveiled a car camera with crash warnings, lane-side alerts, and cruise control features, which were developed in collaboration with Harman.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is based on technologies such as machine automatic learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also showed a “digital cockpit” that allows users to download driver data from mobile devices and the cloud, even if the driver is not the owner.

Fires engulf Dubai's 'flame' tower again
A fire broke out in one of the world’s tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-tall, 79-story supertall.
It was the second fire in just two years to sweep high-rise buildings, and happened to be the tower, known as the “Sfire.”
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported, and no cause of the fire has been found.
“We were sleeping and then we were woken up by the fire and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to run down the 50th floor,” a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said the fire was extinguishing the fire around 4 a.m. local time (0000 GMT) and was cooling the building.
The government said it was working to provide places of refuge for those affected.
The accident could once again raise concerns around the world about the safety of the use of exterior wall materials in high-rise buildings.
An investigation conducted by the Torch Tower management after its 2015 fire found that most of the objects damaged were cladding exterior panels for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe problems with the insulation and vedding system at the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Williams also hinted at the possibility of Massa returning, although he has announced his retirement.
On January 9, only one month away from the opening of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea, the atmosphere of the Winter Olympics in South Korea has become increasingly strong as the Olympic flame is transmitted from south to north.
South Korean public opinion expects this long-lost inter-Korean talks to bring an “egg” to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics one month.
On November 1 last year, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics flame arrived in South Korea.
The craze of the flame is directly reflected in the ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the ticket sales rate of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics was only 32%, and the ticket sales rate of the Winter Paralympics was only 4.3%, and the sluggish ticket sales rate once made the outside world worried about the popularity of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
But as Li Xifan, chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, predicted to reporters not long ago that "with the passing of the Olympic flame in various parts of South Korea, the popularity of the Winter Olympics is increasing, and I believe that the ticket sales situation will soon improve."
According to South Korean media reports, as of January 3, ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics have reached 64%, and the ticket sales rate of the Winter Paralympics has also exceeded 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to Korea to watch the game, the Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on the 8th that it will extend the stay in South Korea for foreigners visiting the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, up to 120 days.
Survey finds more than one in five U.S. travelers on board with prohibited items
An investigation of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 percent of passengers had intentionally or unintentionally encased illegal items at U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, and at least 6 percent of them had unintentionally boarded aboard with a prohibited tool or other edge.
Less than 1 percent of passengers said they were only later found traveling with a firearm, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people, conducted by Charter Services Company Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that young travelers are more likely to blatantly ignore regulations.
Of those who admitted to knowingly bringing TSA prohibited items on board, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent of Gen Xers.
The most common item that deliberately slips through TSA security guards is food and beverages.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying a blade through security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents said they had intentionally carried a banned drug on board.
The company said the survey was conducted by national travelers to understand the number of people who accidentally carried and intentionally carried embargoed goods through security screenings.
Not surprisingly, the people who are most likely to carry embargoed goods through security checks — intentionally or unintentionally — are those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company notes that TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People are often unsure what kind of fluids can be carried and how much fluids can be carried.
Therefore, it is not surprising that TSA has seized the most of the banned liquids.
It was once thought that the TSA might have used books as an embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed.
EPA Administrator Pruitt changes his mind about Obama-era emissions cuts
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementing Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions of smog pollutants.
Pruitt proposed the change because the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of environmental regulatory state agencies than previous governments.
He made no mention of the legal challenge brought by the federal appeals court against his former post.
The focus of the dispute is setting a Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting the 2015 ground-level ozone standard.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay his compliance by a year to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid “interference with local decision-making or hindering economic growth.”
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was Oklahoma’s attorney general, a longtime opposition to the rigor of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to blocking or postponing regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday’s sudden reversal is the latest legal hurdle on Pruitt’s regulatory back-to-extension agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration’s rules requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt offered a U-turn on his approach to ozone standards, saying he wanted to strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency’s commitment to work with states to adopt complex procedures to meet new standards.
Pruitt said that “under the previous administration, the EPA usually did not meet the deadline, then waited for radical groups and others to sue, and then agreed to set a timetable for the designation by agreement.” He initiated more than a dozen prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
“We don’t believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the regulations and the authorities seriously.”
Still, the EPA statement said Pruitt may again use his “extended authorization and all other legally available authorizations” to ensure that the regulations comply with “good policy and the best information available.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broad rewrite of the ozone layer ordinance.
The House bill, approved last month, aims to delay the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led a coalition of states to sue the EPA this week, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
“The EPA’s inversion — after we filed a lawsuit — is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with communities of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by smog emissions,” Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia all joined New York State in the case.
Ground-level ozone is formed by common pollutants emitted by automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources that react under sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive people and cause thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt’s surprising transformation.
Lori Ann Bird of the Centre for Biological Diversity said: “It is disturbing that this common-sense measure is under intense pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe.”
“We must fight to the end with the Trump administration’s ideological movement to cater to polluters and special interests.”
In addition to the external factors of steel price recovery, companies are also struggling to reduce costs.

Shi Haiyong, deputy director of Xiaoshan District Forestry Bureau, said that with the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flower and wood production has also achieved rapid development.
In the past two years, the planting area of Xiaoshan flower trees has expanded by 30,000 mu, with a total area of 180,000 mu; at the same time, it has actively developed outside the district, and Xiaoshan Miao farmers have established flower and wood bases throughout the country to 80,000 mu, an increase of 30,000 mu over 2008.
In the expansion of planting area at the same time, the quality of seedlings is also constantly improving, the value of nursery preservation continues to improve, large-scale, high-quality seedlings retain more, and some seedlings are sold.
Shi Haiyong also reminded that in the face of the current prosperity of production and sales, producers should calmly face and objectively analyze, not only to see that the society's demand for flowers and trees will be long-term and increasing, but also to recognize that the market competition will be more intense.
On the morning of July 13, Beijing time, the US company Somaltus filed a lawsuit with the East Texas District Court, accusing Apple of infringing on a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The company has previously sued ASUS, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba with the same patents.
The lawsuit alleges that both the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringed the US patent No. 7,657,386, under the name of the Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff wants to receive cash compensation or to collect patent fees for the infringing equipment after the judgment is announced.
Judging from the indictment, the plaintiff appears to believe that the iPhone’s fast-charging feature infringes on the company’s patents.
The fast-charging iPhone will quickly charge up to 80% of the power, and then trickle charging.
Somaltus is a so-called “patent treacher” because the company doesn’t offer obvious products and services and has a hard time finding relevant information online.
However, they have successfully settled the patent out of court with automakers such as Ford and Nissan.
The meeting believes that accelerating the development of informatization, promoting the integration and efficient use of resource interconnection, and improving the level of digitalization and intelligence of the industry are of great significance to promote "Made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship and innovation, cultivate new kinetic energy, and improve the quality of life of the masses.

According to leaked phone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the wall.
The Washington Post leaked transcripts of a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reportedly expressed his displeasure at his public attack on the wall, and Putr Lang allegedly said to him: “Do not tell the media.”
Trump promised to build a wall on the southern border of the United States during his presidential campaign and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
The transcript of his call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also released, which showed tense exchanges between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the U.S.-departure deal to Australia was “ridiculous,” “unsavory” and “stupid” that he had suggested the U.S. ban on refugee resettlement, and now sticking to the deal brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a “fool.”
Trump hung up the phone after telling Turnbull that "this is the most unpleasant call today."

Moor Beach Massacre: Acters Recreate Racist lynchings, Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car runs through a crowd of onlookers in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, toward the tiny Moor Beach Bridge.
The car was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and before the car arrived at the bridge, a group of white people with guns stepped forward and blocked the way forward.
The head of this gang of thugs — a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit — took a deep sip of a cigar and glanced into the windshield.
Passengers in the car are full of fear.
"We want - Roger!" cried the man.
“Get him out of the car!”
A young black man was dragged down from the front passenger seat with screams piercing silence.
Fortunately, this terrible scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
But when “Roger” put a noose around his neck, almost all the spectators onlookers gave a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore Beach Bridge to recreate the scene of two black couples — Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mere Dosi — who were lynched by the Three Klux Klan parties in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“While we know who they are, and despite what we’ve seen in the community, it’s incredible that none of them have been arrested over the years,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the repeat.
“This is the stain of history, the burden of our soul.”
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia lawmaker and life-long rights activist.
For him, the reenactment was a compelling call to remind people in the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want to sue, we want to close the case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first,” he said.
“Unless we receive justice, we will not be healed and reconciled.”
On July 27, 1946, the coroner put a sheet on the body of a moor beach lynching victim.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in lynchings.
None of them have been charged.
While the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for lynching is well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote in primaries for the first time later that summer.
According to FBI statistics, around the same time, Roger Malcolm, a black mate farmer, assassinated white landowner Barnet Hirst in a fight — looking like it was for a woman.
Brooks said rumors in the town were that Hearst had slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby wasn't her husband's.
The FBI said that on July 25, 1946, prominent white landowner Roy Harrison spent $600 to bail Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousins, Mary and George Dorsey, accompanied him to prison.
But as they returned from prison and were nearing Moore Beach Bridge, a mob of lynchings surrounded the car.
“It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered this murder,” an FBI report concluded.
“It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks is very brief.
He said, “This is a vote tragedy.”
“They were killed, and it was the murderer who sent a message to the black people in this community: ‘If you register and vote, you will have the same outcome.’ ”
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for the annual reenactment of the Moor Beach Bridge lynchings.
Her expression is vivid, gripping, and deeply racist. Many hope that this racism no longer exists in the United States.
It’s hard to see, it’s harder not to look, but Green says that’s the key.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because lynchings make us face the ugly side of all,” she said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or don't hear me tell you about my experiences, I can't have a relationship with you."
This year’s show began in June, with nearly 30 actors — a dozen whites and the rest black — crammed into a room on the first day to listen to Greene’s release of a rehearsal for an overview of the show.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of the Ku K-Party for many years, but he says the role has never been easy.
“I feel dirty because I’m not a person like that,” Marbau said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this history alive, because we don’t want to go back to that era.”
In the room, actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Lascona, who played Roger Malcolm and Barnet Hirst, rehearsed their lines.
At the beginning of the play, Malcolm yells and pushes away Hirst, angry that he slept with his wife, Dorothy.
“I said, get out of my place!”
Lascona hit back.
And then they fought.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughed the best.
“What’s wrong?” asked Rascona.
He was panicked and confused.
Have I played too much?
“No,” Green said with a laugh.
"I just don't think white people say 'ah' when they hit back."
“Yes,” another black actor quipped.
"Your tone must be tough."
In this way, the energy in the room changed; the feeling of fraternity drove away the feeling of discomfort.
Everyone worked hard to do so, not only to perform the show, but also to commemorate the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona said the word "ah", the tone was sharp and powerful.
No one laughed.
The replay ended powerfully and quickly.
Screams, gunshots, and then silence.
A woman dressed in a funeral black stood by the body of the actor and sang Billy Haladee’s lament “Strange Fruit.”
Her voice overwlned the other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were wiping sweat and tears incessantly.
Black and white people accounted for almost half of the audience.
There was a couple who came from Ithaca, New York, to see the show, and many people lived near the road.
Brooks took them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorothy for nearly eight hours, all of whom endured Georgia's uncomfortable wet and hot feelings.
Until this time, the murderer was still a fan. But now, standing in the same land where lynchings took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the last note of the song disappears, Green asks people to come nearer to examine the bodies played by the actors.
The children leaned down, looked at the fake blood and the corpse, whispering to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” a little boy muttered, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the crowd, and then the show ended.
The actor broke the lynching rope and wiped away the tears.
Bradshaw hugged Marbau, the man in the suit who played the head of the Ku K.
Nick Lascona hugged his two colleagues, weeping in their arms; the emotions in the show eventually infected him.
“It doesn’t matter,” one of the women whispered.
“We know that’s not the case in your heart.
You do it for a reason.”
After that, the audience sat down to dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately with a black couple they had just met, talking about a repeat.
Denis Duplinski had a hard time finding words to describe how she felt after watching.
“It’s hard to imagine those horrible words and actions... people like you say it and make it because they look so much like you,” she said.
“For me, it really makes me think that the lynching is still going on,” she added. “Nowadays it’s called a police shooting.”
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table watching, tasting and regurating with civil rights.
He said he is already planning next year’s show.
“Repetition is an inspiring way to do it because it describes the horrors we’ve experienced, but it’s also very instructive,” he said.
“If you don’t learn from it, this could happen again.
Those who do not study and do not understand their own history are doomed to repeat the mistakes.”
For the reform of natural gas marketization, the importance of reform in terms of "independence of the pipeline network" is self-evident, but the resistance and controversy are also greater.
The reporter learned from Hebei Kailu Group on the 7th that at 11:25 a.m. on the 7th, an explosion occurred in the emulsification workshop of Kailuan Group Chemical Co., Ltd. in Guye District of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and 13 workers were trapped at the scene.
Up to now, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued, rushed to the hospital for rescue, and the remaining 12 people are in the process of intense search and rescue.
It is understood that the scene has been blocked, the local public security, fire, medical and other departments are on the scene of the rescue.
According to witnesses, there was a loud noise and a mushroom cloud vacated for an instant.
According to the on-site organization of search and rescue of Kailu Group personnel, Tangshan Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd. is located in the north of Zhaozhuangbei, Guge District, Tangshan City, Hebei Province, is a state-approved civilian blasting equipment fixed-point production enterprises, was founded in 1958, formerly known as Kailu Mining Bureau Liu O2 factory.

Scientists at China Air Force Engineering University study laser satellite for removal of space junk
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that Chinese scientists have made a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the clutter of Earth's orbit and destroy old satellites and its sky garbage.
According to the US Newsweek website reported on January 15, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University have written a paper entitled "Sky-based Laser Clearance Small Scale Space Debris Reorientation Model Study", which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers into smaller, less harmful debris through the use of space-based platform lasers.
Space junk has been a concern for the international space agency for years, and NASA has considered a variety of options to track, detect and remove man-made debris.
Ways to remove large-scale space debris include giant nets for cleaning and collecting waste, and magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulations and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up Earth's orbit.
The abstract of the paper states: “(The simulation study) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based laser space debris removal techniques.”
A 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there are about 200 threats a day for satellites that are orbiting.
High-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions and has been described by European Space Agency experts as a "deadly litany of threats." High-speed debris has continued to increase over the past year.
According to the website of the US "Popular Machinery" monthly website reported on January 17, space is basically empty, but space next to Earth is becoming more and more crowded. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris orbiting the earth, and over time, these pieces will pile up.
The more debris there is, the higher the chance that a satellite that is still functioning will be hit by the debris, which in turn damages or destroys a multi-million dollar investment.
All space agencies have plans to remove space junk in the future.
NASA is considering using jet gas to slow the debris down and deorbit it, and Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture the debris and bring it back to Earth, and the Japanese idea is to capture the debris with an electric chain.
Now, China is also proposing a solution to space junk, that is, using a large laser to shoot floating space junk into less harmful small pieces.
According to a paper published in the German monthly optical journal, installing such a laser on a satellite would be efficient enough to clean up space, at least according to the simulation results.
The only way to prove effectiveness is to test, and there are no such missions yet, but perhaps sooner or later someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.
Once that’s done, we can finally start eliminating the problem of space junk once and for all.

Pearson lays off another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividends to revive business
Pearson, the British education group, said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 percent as it began another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
Chief Executive John Farron said most of the job cuts will take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after a previous restructuring of 4,000 jobs has been reduced.
Pearson announced in May that it planned to cut an additional £300 million ($394 million) in its third cost-cutting project to revive its business hit by the rapid pace of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann and published a report saying its base sales rose 1% in the first half of the year to £2.55 billion, but said the outlook for the year was unchanged.
A few days ago, the Chinese Field Association seriously issued a notice to strictly fight the phenomenon of running, and prepared to give violators a heavy penalty for a lifetime ban.
Suicide bombing in Kabul kills NATO soldiers
According to official sources, a military convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Karabagh district.
It was the latest violent attack in Afghanistan — Tuesday’s Herat mosque bombing killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to the NATO statement, an explosion occurred late Thursday, in which a joint patrol of the Afghan-NATO coalition forces was attacked by "individuals carrying improvised explosive devices."
The statement said all of the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to reporters, the growing Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in the Karabakh region have raised serious concerns among NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while the death toll in the capital was about 20 percent.
A suicide car bomb attack in Kabul’s Shiite-dominated region in late July killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claimed they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the center of Kabul killed more than 150 people in what was the deadliest militant attack in the country since the U.S.-led multinational force toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade-off as to whether Afghanistan is growing to support his troops and police at a time when the country is at risk.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also sparked a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, particularly President Ashraf Ghani’s reputation.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Overturns Resolutions After Lawsuit, Delays Smoke Regulations
When Obama was in office, he ordered states to curb the various types of emissions that caused the smog, and 15 states sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the purpose of the rule. A day later, the EPA overturned the rule.
The EPA announced Wednesday its decision to continue the so-called “Ozone-to-Ozone compliance zone of 2015” and promised to work with states.
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement, “We have full confidence in the dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it.”
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA plans to postpone the implementation of ozone-to-standard zone standards to October 2018 with a one-year delay — according to which existing smog pollution is measured in some areas to determine which areas should reduce emissions that cause smog pollution to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday claiming the violation.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump’s administration has been working to reinstate the various environmental regulations pushed by former President Barack Obama to spur economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups. They fear more emissions will affect public health.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website claims that breathing ozone-containing air “decreases lung function and increases respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.

McKee Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time to discuss a possible future decisive battle
The most high-profile under 147-pound boxing match will be held shortly, with Vasily Lomachenko and McKee Garcia meeting for the first time on Thursday, currently in a state of possible conflict.
They were separate rooms in the ESPN office in Los Angeles, where undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead in walking down the hallway to greet World Boxing Organization Super Feather Champion Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing event on Saturday, the referee unanimously determined that Garcia defeated four-part world champion Adrian Broner to victory, and both fighters have become the top five players in the same heavyweight list.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, “Champion, how are you?”
Good luck to you.”
At 7 p.m. on Saturday at 7 p.m., Lomachenko defeated Miguel Mariaga to secure his position.
When they were both photographed, Lomachenko’s agent, Eggis Klimas, noted that the potential match between the two players depended on “perfect size.”
“I was lightweight before,” Garcia said.
“I raised my level to play Brona (140 pounds), but I didn’t weigh that much.
Compared to 140 pounds, I weigh almost as much.
I want to go back to being lightweight.
And he has to be lightweight (135 pounds) before we can fight.
That’s what the fans want too.
Then we'll satisfy them."
Lomachenko agrees.
"The boxing world needs this battle."
Clemes asked him if he should charge a per-mansion, and part of his strategy was to have Lomachenko make his debut with a 135-pounder later this year, with the idea of agreeing a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout rounds) next summer. Garcia is also interested in a duel with the winner of the Rhod Linares-Luke Campbell battle after the Lightweight Boxing Championship on September 23.
"Because all the fans are asking this question, this battle could be a pay-per-view fee," Garcia said. After that, he was open to playing on the network that offered the best financial solutions.
“We are the main people.
Others cannot have so much attention.
As long as they are ready...”
Garcia praised Lomachenko as "a fantastic runner" and may be watching his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko hesitated for Garcia's accolades, saying he thought the three-part division from Riverside looked "slow. Sorry, McKee... you're going to be eliminated."
Garcia said the focus is on showing the strength of the fist, and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing match.
“This is a battle that needs to be fought,
Attention and heat are beyond the reach of other boxing matches.
I would love to play,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, this time it's McKee's turn.
It's going to be a great battle."

China's National Development and Reform Commission officials on the 11th Five-Year reduction target ahead of the completion of the 11th Five-Year reduction target, so that the limited power supply and suppression of the steel industry has a strong expectation of resumption of production.
Although the steel mill has not received a clear notice from the local government that the energy conservation and emission reduction work has been completed, the industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, the steel mills that were originally limited in production will successively complete the resumption of production, and the steel price may begin to come under pressure.
At present, it has not received the notice of the end of the power limit, but in fact, the pressure of various enterprises has been much less than in September and October, a private steel enterprise in Hebei Province told reporters.
Some parts of Hebei have repeatedly issued power-limiting production documents, and once adopted the forced locks to restrict the production of enterprises.
The reporter learned from local enterprises that at present, steel mills in most parts of Hebei have resumed work, and the pressure on production limits has eased.
Zhang Tieshan, an analyst of my steel network, expects that because the north has entered the winter, the terminal demand for construction steel will gradually change from strong to weak.
In addition to the gradual end of energy conservation and emission reduction, by December 15, most steel mills will be basically restored, and products will arrive in various markets before New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the steel prices that are currently rising.

The representative of Italy said that Italy has a variety of environmental protection technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources, and proposed to carry out pilot projects with China in the areas of industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration treatment equipment, and looks forward to promoting the experience of environmental cooperation with China to the rest of the world.
Latest results from Sweden’s age assessment test for asylum seekers announced
The latest test for asylum seekers in Sweden uses the latest method to assess their age, and the latest results show that more than 80% of the subjects are judged to be over 18 years old, but not everyone believes in its accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
After allegedly failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Migration Board has sent 6,880 test subjects, and the Forensic Science Center has now published the results of a total of 2,481 test subjects between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty percent (2002 people) were judged to be 18 years of age or older, but in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Science determined that the subjects were “probably 18 years or older.”
In 432 tests, the result was that the person “may be under 18 years old.”
The test is only for people with questionable age.
According to John Glenson of the Center for Forensic Medicine, these results are consistent with those of previous months.
He told The Local: “These figures are not much different from those of the previous months, the numbers are very consistent.”
A higher proportion of cases of persons over the age of 18 do not necessarily mean that these asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the center published 581 test results and said 442 cases “indicated that the subject was 18 years of age or older.”
Newspaper Svenska Dagbladet surveyed the results of the 581 published results and found that 243 of them had publicly stated that they would be 18 years of age or older this year.
X-rays of wisdom teeth, MRI scans of joints, and then analysis by dentists and radiologists, this medical evaluation approach is also being questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics was Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work included assessing people’s biological maturity to determine whether they experienced puberty earlier or later than normal.
He told the newspaper Metro: “I have reason to think that, and I don’t think the measurement used should be like that.
It is very inaccurate to determine the biological age in this way.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we can do it.”
However, Gramson of the Forensic Science Center defended the accuracy of these tests: "The risk of not determining whether a child is an adult is generally very small."
The biggest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, which is about 10%.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Party
On Thursday night, West Virginia Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced at President Trump’s rally that he would change party.
“Like it or not, the Democrats have left me,” the governor’s judge said.
“Today, after a lot of prayer and a lot of thought, I want to tell you... Today I want to tell you as a West Virginian, I can no longer help you as the Democratic governor.”
There was cheering in the rally.
“So, tomorrow, I’m going to change my party membership to the Republican Party,” Jastis added.
"As a coach, I want to tell you it's time to start another game."
Trump earlier promised a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42 percent of the vote in West Virginia, and Justis did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justis was voted the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes noted that he inherited his father’s coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
Currently, he is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement late Thursday, saying, “Governor Jastis’s party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which not only prevents our country from becoming great again, but makes our country great again.”
“With Democrats currently having only 15 governors and controlling the lowest number of state legislatures, Governor Justis’s statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unified slogan,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Rona McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Koko praises Russia's 'frank' apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, Sebastián Ko, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, praised Russia's apology for the doping scandal and called it "frank", but he reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to rejoin the sport.
Russian Athletics Federation President Mitri Jacques Chiractin said at the IAAF conference on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country was right to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that “all athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were deprived of their medals”.
Despite this comment, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban. Previously, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report mentioned the discovery of evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping, which was imposed in November 2015.
“I think today’s response was very frank, very candid,” IAAF President Frank told reporters.
“The entire Council and the IAAF are pleased ... The Russian Federation has acknowledged that it has gone through a very burning period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can resume its participation in the competition.”
Ko said he was also "delighted" that Russia had accepted the criteria for re-entering the race.
“I think it’s a very constructive day and also think we’ve made some progress, but the IAAF support the panel’s recommendations are not yet the time to resume Russia’s eligibility,” Ko said.
“We need to do everything we can to normalize that in the coming months.”
Our guiding principle has always been to want to separate innocent athletes from the contaminated system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the IAAF’s strict standards and will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
Von Anderson, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met several criteria for resuming participation.
Speaking to the IAAF council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still inadequate and that banned coaches were still coaching.
At the publicity campaign of the first anniversary of the implementation of the "Beijing Smoking Control Regulations" held this morning, the representative of the young students who won the National Youth Tobacco Control Micro Video of the "My Tobacco Control Declaration" interacted with Huang Xuan, the national tobacco control publicity ambassador, and reviewed the video of the collection activities and the exhibition of the award-winning outstanding works.
The reporter learned from the event that Huang Xuan, a young actor, was hired as a national tobacco control publicity ambassador.
Huang Xuan exposed himself to smoking in college, after fully understanding the dangers of smoke, successfully quit smoking, this time more active to assume the responsibility of smoking cessation ambassador, calling on young people to stay away from tobacco.

Market participants pointed out that in recent times, the European Central Bank's monetary policy tightening is expected to push up the euro exchange rate, the dollar index has declined continuously, and the RMB has a corresponding wave of rapid pull-up against the dollar exchange rate, but at present, the European Central Bank is unlikely to adjust its policy stance soon, and the short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange market will eventually return to fundamentals.

How will football financial rules affect Neymar’s move to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by big European clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (PSG) in France at a record price.
The result was a further relegation of the European Football Association (UEFA) to Paris Saint-Germain Football Club. The European Football Association is the governing body of European football and has the right to ban teams from the much-discussed Champions League.
The introduction of the Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) by UEFA in 2011 means that Paris Saint-Germain will eventually have to prove that Neymar’s transfer is funded without causing huge losses.
The club has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to pay the Brazilian player for the release, and Neymar’s salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar’s move to France.
Given that the team is funded by the well-funded Qatari ruling family, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club can certainly sign Neymar with cash and include him in teams with other stars.
Clubs can spend a lot of money on players, but they have to use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge amount of money they spend to break even in their football-related business.
The Financial Fair Play Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after being elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that are heavily indebted in pursuit of success, if banks or everyone withdraws their support funds, they are in fact cheating and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from the club’s debt problems to the club’s loss situation monitoring.
The change means that Roman Abramovich’s business model, when he bought Chelsea in 2003, buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and build it into a global brand is now facing a more demanding situation.
During the three-year Rules assessment period up to 2018, the club could lose €30 million.
Despite Abu’s disparaging bid by the then president in 2015, UEFA’s successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
“Of course the Rules haven’t lapsed yet, and we’re definitely going to strengthen the regulations of the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of the rules, told The Associated Press last week.
Although Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will pay Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can also be allocated for the purpose of accounting during the term of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so transfer fees are likely to show a fee of €44.4 million in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of rules imposed in 2014 imposed imposed the toughest sanctions on Paris Saint-Germain FC and the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City club.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the time exchange rate) and later reduced to 20 million euros, and asked for the 2014-15 Champions League to reduce the number of players to 21 instead of the normal 25 players in the 2014-15 Champions League.
UEFA is watching to stare at clubs that are trying to increase revenue and deceive financial regulators by pegging to club owners.
While Qatari companies can sponsor Paris Saint-Germain FC, UEFA will not consider it a legitimate income if the amount of sponsorship is deemed to exceed the standard market price.
That’s what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of money Qatar Tourism Board sponsored to Paris Saint-Germain Football Club had been overstated.
It is reported that part of Neymar's revenue at Paris Saint-Germain Football Club may come from the payment made by the 2022 Qatar World Cup organizing committee.
However, both Paris-Saint-Germain and the organizing committee have denied that Neymar will be ambassador for the World Cup, and it is easy for UEFA’s regulators to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on Paris Saint-Germain mean that UEFA will be more wary of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the matter said on Thursday that UEFA had not had any prior discussions with Paris-Saint-Germain on Neymar's transfer.
All of them were only in contact with The Associated Press in an unnamed capacity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
According to the last published accounts, the operating income of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club in 2015-16 was 542.4 million euros, and the profit was more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not yet been published.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects Neymar’s joining to be a boon for sponsorship events, franchises and shirt sales.
The club expects revenue to grow by at least 30% after signing Neymar.
It is clear that the Spanish league is deeply angry to see one of the most famous players leave, trying to hinder Neymar's move and claiming that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club violated the rules.
La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS that “this is a clear example of a ‘financial doping’, the club and the country are alike”, referring to Qatar, which has ultimate ownership of Paris-based St. Germain Football Club.
Arsenal team (who owns all the American sports tycoons) manager Arsene Wenger has reservations about state-funded clubs and La Liga.
“It’s a consequence of ownership, and it’s revolutionizing the entire ecology of football over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“Once the country owns the club, then anything can happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, because for a country there are many different ways or interests in which a big player is required to represent a country.”
Intelligent interactive robot developer Rokid gets new investment Temasek led the investment

"Bean evangelization" is based on the story of the Han Dynasty Huainan Wang Liu An in traditional Chinese culture, born from the traditional allusion of "Liu An made tofu, because of the mistake", tells the story of the protagonist "bean blessing" from a bean illusion adult shape, overcome many difficulties, adhere to the dream of Xiu Xian.
Wudang Mountain in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, is one of the world cultural heritage sites announced by the United Nations, and is also the birthplace of Taoist culture and martial arts, known as "the eternal victory, the world's first fairy mountain".
Director Zou Yan revealed that in the early stage of the film's creation, he had traveled with the original team to Wudang Mountain to gather the wind.
He said that the story of "Bean Evangelization" took place during the Western Han Dynasty, in the context of Huainan King Liu An's cultivation of Xianxiang, the hero of the film "Bean Fu" is a bean that accidentally phantoms the adult shape when Liu An's alchemy.
In addition to Wudang Mountain, the birthplace of Taoist culture, Hubei also has a deep relationship with China's long-established traditional musical instruments - the clock.

Nostalgia is all the most popular in the market - "Hara Summer Camp" and "Detective Two Men"
The story is recapturing the actors of the 1980s and the garbage days of the 1990s (before and after David Wayne and Michael Schwhart produced the sketch comedy Country for MTV); it was also a nostalgia for nostalgia itself, nostalgia for 2001, a year in which stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Luther were yet to emerge.
As a cultural work of art, it is the imitation and embodiment of the permanent memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like there’s not enough time.
The first day of camp was met with a strong response, but not just because of its absurd humor (the story is about an original story of a canned vegetable that speaks, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The double use of the core laughing terfir in the plot - middle-of-the-life actors play a trick-or-treating age child - which makes the inability to go back to the past and become a funny part.
Ten years later, adults actually play adults, the emotions are not too deep-rooted, imitation is more scattered, including the improvisation of the 90s tracking movies, such as "The Hands to Push the Cradle".
At some point, a character gets caught up in an Apple notebook, some straight-line skates, and “some other things from 1991.”
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweetheart (Mr. Hewhaett) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn’t forgotten Katie (Margaret Morrow).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has a virgin.
There is another sinister conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Hewitt), instigated by George H.W. Bush (Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of this series is chimed in.
It’s especially interesting to see this forever-young Mr. Luther, who flaunted Matt Dillon’s soul patch in the movie Single Noble, and Andy in the previous “School Giants” now feels like a giant.
It’s a time of random madness that could power the film, like the recursive Seven Years of Life series, until I come to the conclusion that I think is logical: Hara Summer Camp: Twenty Years Later, and its final act is for the cast to see the movie premiere of “Hara Summer Camp.”
At the same time, Amazon's "Detective Two Men" tells a different kind of nostalgia: Cold War revivalism of "American Spy Dream", the movie "The Extreme Cold City", and even "GLOW: Gorgeous Women's Wrestling Alliance" with East-West wrestling imagery.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatwood and Alessandro Tanaka, was put on the television screen by director Rees Thomas: a sibling comedy set in 80s-era Romania, tells the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for the truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist line.
The main characters - Hardcore Grigor and the idealistic Essef - were played by Florin Pirszi Jr. and Cornelius Ulrich, respectively, whose dialogues were voiced in English by Chaning Tatuum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It was a wonderful idea.
But it’s not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (police watch TV playing chess to pass the time because Americans like to play soccer).
And there are a number of celebrity voice actors – including Jenny Slet, Nick Overman, MahSarah Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevini – creating a spectacular sound event.
But Detective Two Hungeons is so committed to creating a hustle and bustle-realistic promotional comedy — a hitman wearing a Reagan mask — and it usually plays such a role.
The six-episode television show was slightly drag-out, and the comedy effect was released quickly or frequently.
The film is more rigorously edited, and when Gregor and Isef repeatedly visited the U.S. Embassy, it showed a better inflammatory irony, because there were always two fat people gorging a bunch of hamburgers in the lobby of the embassy.

The reporter recently interviewed and learned that the benefits of steel, rail transit, shipbuilding, machinery manufacturing and other industries in the northeast region generally declined, and even lost money.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of revitalization of the Northeast industry is not only related to the current round of national economic recovery, but also has an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust and transform.
The efficiency of the traditional industries is more and the profit of the raw material industry and the heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing industry has seriously declined or even lost money, which is the primary performance of the northeast industry in the current round of economic downturn.
In the past, in the economic downturn, mainly low-end and primary products were affected by the big impact, but in this economic fluctuation, the high-end and low-end industrial products of the Northeast's traditional industries were affected.
Ansteel Group (Weibo) a few years ago from the adjustment of product structure to focus on the development of container panels, steel rails, shipboards and civil home appliances and other high-end plates, but this year these varieties of sales have fallen sharply, especially the sales of shipboards fell by 50% compared with the same period last year, sales fell by 50% compared with the same period last year.
Ansteel shares (the Liaoning Provincial Industry and Information Technology Commission metallurgical director Hao Qingshun said that metallurgy is the third pillar industry of Liaoning, with an annual output of 60 million tons of steel production capacity ranked third in the country.
From January to May this year, the output of crude steel in Liaoning Province was 21.54 million tons, the production and marketing of products required by national policies and strong local government construction projects were better, and the decline in products with fierce market competition was relatively large, which was another feature of the manufacturing industry in the northeast.

The Japanese Olympic Committee recently said that the Japanese delegation's gold medal target for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games is 30, and it will advance to the top three gold medals.

Bank of England to maintain interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and accommodative inflation have dashed hopes of an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be “weak” as it tightens household incomes while keeping interest rates under control.
Policymakers on the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to maintain the 0.25% rate, while a handful of members this month have called for higher rates even as weak economic growth has waned the boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England cut its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and warned that the contraction in household income would continue, while inflation would skyrocket to nearly 3% in the autumn.
But he said interest rates would need to be raised over the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs would likely need to rise more sharply in financial markets.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented due to Brexit, and members also voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce a halt to its regular funding programme, which will provide cheap funding to banks starting in February next year, although the bank said it would now need an additional £15bn on top of £115 billion under the scheme.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision-making meeting, the Bank of England said: “In the core forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term, as the contraction in real household income will continue to restrain consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for “certain monetary policy tightening” to suppress inflation and to a “greater degree” than the market expects.
At present, the market is expected to achieve its first growth in the third quarter of next year and the second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any upswing would be “slow” and “restraint.”
The bank’s growth forecasts for this year and next are on a downward trend, compared with 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The bank maintained its forecast of 1.8% growth in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar, followed by the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 percent against the dollar to 1.31, while the euro fell 0.4 percent to 1.11.
The decision to remain unchanged came after rising expectations were shattered by recent gloomy growth figures. GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with just 0.2% in the previous three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter was likely to remain at 0.3%, although it will rise slightly at the end of the year.
The average household has been hit by inflationary inflation and wage growth has been negligible, and the Bank of England’s recent inflation report has not brought them good news, as the bank says austerity will get worse before it gets better.
He said monetary policy “cannot prevent” a blow to incomes in the coming years, but that wages are expected to recover “on a massive scale” by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, because of the depreciation of the pound, the demand for British goods has increased significantly, and the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the impact of low consumption.
The decision comes a year after a stunning EU referendum sent the pound plunging, with interest rates cut to 0.25 percent in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take four years to fully impact prices and the UK economy.
The bank’s latest rate ruling comes after calls for an increase in interest rates, as inflation has exacerbated the already stressed average household, while three policymakers have called for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, although the Bank of England said that was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that relative to its 2% target, the excess is already the final bottom line of the weak pound.
Andrew Montereyk, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market appears to be becoming more competitive again as lenders strongly appeal for more business and look forward to a positive period this year.
Such a market looks particularly favorable for those who may be close to an existing deal, as remortgage (many of which are fee-free and have low interest rates) are becoming increasingly popular.
China Earthquake Network officially determined that at 19:02 on November 13, an 8.0-magnitude earthquake occurred in New Zealand (42.53 degrees south latitude, 173.05 degrees east longitude), with a depth of 10 kilometers, and the capital Wellington felt strongly.
The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) has given the green light to controversial HIV drugs.
With the dust settled in the High Court’s funding of NHS drugs, patients will be able to access “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England announced that Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk groups by around 86%. The health service will now deliver the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ruling last year. The ruling said the NHS was entitled to pay PrEP for the cost of the drug despite the NHS's claim that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move, announced on Thursday, was described by NHS chief executive Simon Stevens as a "significant new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register sexual health clinics. More clinics will be added in October, followed by a full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug that is taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Trials have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific medications in the body to prevent HIV infection.
This medication can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment included gay, bisexual men, transgender people, and positive HIV carriers who had not successfully received treatment.
The clinic will identify eligible participants who agreed to the trial, including those who are unknown to men, women, transgender people and their sexual partners who are infected with HIV status with HIV.
People who live and register as a general practitioner in England can also register at their local sexual health clinic.

“This major new intervention should be a broad and increasingly successful complement to and strengthen HIV prevention.”
This is yet another milestone that has been worthwhile for more than 30 years of action to make progress in addressing the major health challenges of humanity.”
Deborah King, chief executive of the UK AIDS Trust (NAT), said: “This is a critical time in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target people in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the possibility of changing the HIV epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people at risk of HIV will be given a new, permissioned tool through the NHS-funded trial in England, which is truly self-contained, without consultation with sexual partners, which will bring improvements to the lives of many people.
We agree with the announcement.”
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority now is to ensure that trials are rolled out quickly across the country and that none of the people living with HIV are left behind.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP trial, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “After months of delays and government delays, the start of PrEP’s first trial is welcome and should have come sooner.
Evidence shows how this drug can change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This trial will allow us to further and fully understand the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important to launch the trial as soon as possible across the country to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us go one step further to end the spread of HIV in society.”

High quality of life: application of loft and clever design to make the Count's Palace small apartment a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker who was keen to renovate her house, moved from her Grand House on Knightsbridge to a small apartment in the Count's Palace in 2014.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – Joanne didn’t pack her bags and sell it, which is a powerful testament to the new design.
“Before that, my ex-boyfriend and I were living in a larger house on Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for the right house.
I saw this apartment in the Count's Palace, and its ceiling was also very high.
I liked it, and made an offer that day."
Since the first time you’ve seen the room, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has now been overhauled.
Originally a studio with a complex layout — requiring passage through the kitchen to walk to the bedroom — Joanne wanted to add storage space and loft to make the most of the ceiling height.
“I want high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That’s what I asked,” she said.
To this end, she hired Elfan Azadi from Duck & Shed Architecture and Design Studio (Notting Hill) to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to build a home. This home is not only a development project, but also a place where Joanne lives.
The ceiling is not high enough to add up to two up and down spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a high enough to stand up attic.
Elfan had to be creative in order to solve the problem.
“The steel structure is quite complex,” he explained.
“We have to arrange the space to be displayed up and down, and there is no need to shrug the back of the bow.
It’s not just about building a simple platform, but starting these steels to put them at the right height to achieve functionality.”
Through this arrangement, Elfan was able to obtain two full-body high rooms in the space - which can add a lot of interesting elements.
The loft features retro copper windows from the Retrouvius brand overlooking the enchanting living area.
Golden furniture with mirrors, silver piece furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting lay the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Put a mirror on both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the splash board with a mirror is like a window to another room.
At the porch, small lattices with mirrors provide Joanne with storage space for tableware and glassware.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space and can be put away when the kitchen is unused.
The kitchen is not fresh.
But what makes this folding kitchen unique is a garage-style lift door.
“Some engineering knowledge is involved here,” Elfan explains of the reinforced MDF door.
“It’s a balancing principle, so when you push the door, it’s easy to slide.”
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“Ultimately, what you’re selling is the size of the house — or your property valuation is based on the size of the house,” Elfan said.
“Basically, a real estate agent walks into a room and calculates it based on floor size.”
They will try to increase the space occupied by using high-quality materials at the same time, thus bringing a sense of luxury to this space.
Elfan said, “Materials are hand-picked by you, and therefore help to create emotional bonds at home.”
“You don’t love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't hold your heartstrings."
It turns out that with good design and extra space, standard apartments can be transformed to amaze you.
In fact, you may choose to live like Joanne.

Two brothers stage $500 million real estate empire battle
Forty years after the founding of their Italian family, the brothers battled for one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, a former director and developer of Carleton Football Club, lives in a mansion in the Tukkala district, and the three doors are at the residence of his brother Paul. The latter took him to the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has wanted to break away from the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have been arguing fiercely over the asset split in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mother own a total of 38 real estate, worth more than $500 million, which have accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in the Collingwood district in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it to 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
The money was then put into real estate. Currently, the De Rutis family's portfolio of assets includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorrento development projects, Gold Coast and Bühler Hill apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, who was called the “principal promoter and dominant figure” of the De Lutis family by his younger brother Paul, had about two-thirds of the company’s assets, while Paul made up about a third.
Documents filed with the court state that Colin owned $316 million worth of property and $176 million worth of property Paul.
Paul argues that the separation of real estate and cash is the crux of the negotiations.
“Colin’s proposal for the division of property left what I think is the best,” he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
On Friday, after several failed mediation, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now, the two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul said Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed a desire to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian tradition dictates that family is the most important option. My Italian ancestry determines that family is the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case has been rising, along with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and corporate reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers from both parties.
Ms. de Rutis and her late husband Luigi are both Italian immigrants. They have been running mass restaurants and deli since the late 1950s, and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin said, “When I was in high school,” and he started Westco there, “Paul was very young (about 10 years old) at the time.”
Anna de Rutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to pass on their property to her son in peace.
“Luigi often told me that he would never want his brothers to go to court in the end,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the De Rutis Group of Companies, and Colin said Mark paid him $10 million when he left the company and $26 million to Luke.
Paul says that both Luke and Mark “dissare to their property division terms.”
According to a biography published in 2015 by TV star Eddie McGuire, Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers, on Friday.
However, only Colin responded by text message. He said that because the case had been brought to court, "I really can't say much."
“It is very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet his brother’s request.
“Our father did not want to see Paul and me end up in such a dispute,” he said, adding that he “still holds out hope for the settlement of the dispute.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to be dashed.
“Our issues will be resolved through the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried, but all failed.
John F. Kelly might actually be able to do it.
If that’s true, he’s the first.
According to Politico, the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in a bid to keep big bosses calmer.
Here’s a quote from journalist Josh Dawcy:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, began his first day of work, gathered with senior officials to discuss, he pointed out that he wanted to address one of the main issues that President Trump had in the White House: the bad information that flowed into the hands of the president.”
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the president make better decisions, so the information needed to go through his hands — in writing or in the form of a briefing.
Kelly’s diagnosis may seem like a model, but others have tried to tame it by spying on Trump’s media time, but all ended in failure.
President Trump’s television addiction has a long history — now in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico: “If candidate Trump is frustrated by unfair reporting, it will be helpful to let him know that he has also received positive reporting in credible channels.”
Politico’s Tara Palmery wrote at the time that “based on the experience of the six former campaign officials, the point of controlling Trump’s Twittering habits is to ensure that the media messages he personally receive contain a certain amount of praise.”
That's no problem at all.
But Trump’s Twitter habit was once “controlled” that it was ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know – that is, if it weren’t for their interference, Trump’s tweets would have been even more raging.
We may never know the tweets Trump didn’t send.
If his staff can save him from the water and fire, even if only a few times, their efforts are worth it.
But no one can stop Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing blocs, people promote their worldviews and push their careers by handing over to Trump sources that may or may not be reliable.
Politico — all about the story — reported in May on advisers’ penchant for strategically providing dubious information to the president.
This is an example of what journalist Shane Goodmancher described:
Current and former Trump officials say Trump’s response to negative news footage such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with damaging information leaks, would be frantically wanting to find out where it came from.
At the end of February, someone maliciously copied an article on the website of the network agitator Charles C. Johnson, GotNews.com, to the president, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of the White House of “a source of a lot of information leaks,” which Trump said at the time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, he had not provided any concrete evidence, and he had blown up a lot of false allegations, which were later publicly denied.
Trump read the article and started asking officials about Walsh's situation."
Goodmancher also said that then-Chief of Staff Reines Prybass and White House Secretary Rob Porter “had tried to build a system to manage and record documents received by Trump.”
What is the result?
Kelly was going to do the same thing, in three months.
He may be able to prove that he is a more effective manager than Prybas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing with each other for influence.
These timeless factors make Kelly’s task more difficult.

Motorhomes negotiate over ditches, return to 'rich street'
Some of the richest owners in the West Midlands have clashed with determined motorhomes, who are negotiating a government-excavated ditch to return land beyond their mansion.
Motorhomes park their 20 trailers in an open space outside the bustling Solihuel Street, which is dubbed “Rich Street.”
Motorhomes, armed with horses, bosom and motorhome convoys, returned after being driven out in May, and the city’s “moat” did not stop them from entering.
The sleek and sophisticated team found a gap in the defensive line, and although there was a section of the road that was not set up to pass, their vehicles squeezed through the gap.
Angry residents sharply criticized the Solihull Council, saying it was “bad in dealing with this issue.”
One resident, who asked not to be named, said: “They were there on Monday night before they came to Bentley Heath Street and threw stones at passers-by.
The Commission should be ashamed of what they do, because they are simply useless in dealing with them.
Motorhomes came here in May, then were driven out, and now they’re back.
There was a lot last night, and maybe more today."
She added: “Birmingham City Council knows how to handle it in a way that protects its parks by imposing a long ban.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and if Parliament can’t stop something like this, I’m not willing to continue paying municipal taxes.
A local resident, who asked not to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last group of motorhomes go, just to facilitate another batch to destroy."
This time the number increased, and some people even saw horses eating grass on the park lawn.”
A Solihull council spokeswoman said: “We are aware of people who are engaged in unlicensed camping on a vacant lot on Szhutbr Road and now we are working with the Solihull Police and taking the necessary legal action to move them away as soon as possible.
To support us in gathering evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to outline the situation when we refer cases to the Court for examination.”

Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian officials detained him on suspicion that the crew of a ship on a ship by the German aid group Youth Rescue was actually colluding with human traffickers to help illegal immigrants.
The aid group has only been in operation for a year and declined to comment on the specific subject of the allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“Saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us, and we regret that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at this time,” the group said in a statement on social media.
“After all the information has been collected, we can only assess all the allegations and the situation at this time.”
Italian officials have been monitoring the Iuventa, a ship organized by Youth Relief, since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants carried by human traffickers directly from small boats and allowed smugglers to flee in haste and re-utilize the ships.
According to the prosecutor's records, at least one such meeting allegedly took place 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya. The contents of the document were published by Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons other than any other motive.
According to the Code of Conduct, vessels such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to supervise their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children, Malta, Malta, and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday it considered the new rules, while unnecessary, but acceptable because they did not bring any “significant changes or impediments” to their rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti said the sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks shows that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
“In recent days, we have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He unveiled plans for this month’s in-depth talks: discussing economic development with Libyan mayors and Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants leaving the country for Europe.
Lian Ping, chief financial scientist of Bank of Communications, said that due to the characteristics of industrial value added in the first three quarters of 2017, it is expected that the growth of industrial added value in December may accelerate to 6.6%.
The cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December is expected to be 7.2%, the same as the previous month and lower than last year.
Although industrial production will be weaker than in October, it will be basically the same as November.
In December, China's manufacturing investment was running at a low level, but infrastructure investment improved slightly, so it is expected that fixed asset investment will be flat in November.

Beijing "university relief" new measures: North Chemical tens of thousands of teachers and students will be stationed in Changping new campus
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing University of Chemical Technology was held in Changping District of Beijing on the 2nd, and the green campus covering an area of 1,800 acres was officially put into use.
The reporter learned from the ceremony that in order to strengthen the core function of the capital and control the "big city disease", in recent years, under the background of the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the promotion of the central urban colleges and universities to the suburbs for the relief, and some teachers and students of some universities are moving to the new campuses in Shunyi, Daxing, Fangshan and other suburbs.
Beichuan New Campus is located in Changping Nankou Town, covering an area of 1,800 acres, 40 kilometers from the city, is one of the key projects in Beijing to ease non-capital functions.
The new campus is divided into three phases of construction, the current phase of construction has been completed, the second phase of construction is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, all after the completion of the plan will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate, graduate and teaching staff learning and life.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two groups of fans of the participating stars have become an important part of the expected audience of the film.
At 17:10 today, the 119th Command Center of Shaoyang City received an alarm that a fire occurred in the tetrahydromanure storage at the Hongzhi chemical plant in Longsutang, Shuangqing District, the city.
Shaoyang City Fire Detachment immediately dispatched 5 squadrons of 20 fire trucks with heavy chemical clothing, anti-chemical washing vehicles and other equipment to the scene.
After preliminary investigation, the fire was a small storage tank that stored chemical substances such as tetrahydrofuran, and the smoke was generated at the scene.
As of press time, fire officers and soldiers are intensively rescue, and the city's health, safety supervision, environmental protection, public security, transportation and other departments have rushed to the scene, and no casualties have been found.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Texting to Comand Roy to Comad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for abusing her boyfriend to commit suicide by texting and phone.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months in prison, after which she will be replaced with a suspended sentence.
Carter was convicted in June of the crime of inadvertent and non-premeditated murder against Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at Thursday’s hearing: “My family is heartbroken.
My son is my best friend."
While awaiting appeal, Carter was granted personal freedom.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her team of lawyers believes she and Mr. Roy are both mentally ill.
At the sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and a beige hoodie, with his hands clasped, his eyes in tears and his eyes down.
“Her actions killed Conrad Roy,” prosecutors told the court.
She ended her life for the better of her life.
She is not responsible,” the prosecutor said.
"She has no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence, and she feels very sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her “age or maturity, or even her mental illness, will have any significant impact on her behavior.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Lynn Roy, Roy’s mother, saying, “I haven’t had a day without being sad about losing my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of what I have done. I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain, which will stay with us forever," the statement said.
Mr. Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was “in a truancy” because she realized she could never attend her brother’s wedding or become his child’s aunt.
“The loss of someone who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and the rest of my life will be with that pain,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, because Massachusetts law does not provide for abetting the guilt of others to commit suicide.
Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car in 2014, when Carter was 17.
Carter’s text messages revealed that after she instied him to commit suicide, the case drew national attention.
“There are many ways to hang yourself, jump, stab yourself,” she said in several text messages sent two weeks before he died, when he was on vacation with his family.
In the period before he killed himself, she wrote: "You need to do this, Conrad", "All you have to do is start the generator, and then you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter gained attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There is a legal divergence in this case.
Amanda Knox, one of the few who defended Carter, was acquitted two years after she was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms Knox, 30, said in an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment.”
Zhang Yimou is destined to be a controversial film artist, from the beginning of his first film "Red Sorghum", he has been leading the Chinese film trend at the same time, but also gained a lot of criticism.
The reporter learned from the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club on the 2nd that recently, the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team won the fourth place in the National Youth Basketball League Finals held in Beijing.
The Lhasa Pure Earth Basketball Youth Team consists of 11 local players, and the head coach is Tsering Sangju, assistant coach of the Lhasa Pure Land Mens Basketball Team.
Tibet's "basketball boy" before heading to Beijing to participate in the finals.
Liang Junchao, general manager of Lhasa Pure Earth Basketball Club, told reporters that compared with last year, the team's achievements have improved, and the players' self-confidence and the confidence of the game have been significantly improved. The communication between the players and other teams is also more comprehensive, and the on-court and off-court exchanges are more and easier.
After the game, Captain Jiang Tso said that he hoped to accumulate experience by participating in the game and do his best for the cause of basketball in Tibet.
It is understood that in the game in Beijing, the players overcame the low altitude drunk oxygen and other factors, showing the image of Tibet.
Although track and field is a big gold medal in the Olympic Games, and track and fielders won the world, but the track and field name will compete with the gold is in the downwind.
Automakers face shock, Audi will retrofit up to 850,000 diesel cars
Audi announced the modification a day after BMW said it would offer software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW’s chairman said it believed “driving has more smart options than restrictions,” meaning that major European cities – including Munich, where BMW’s headquarters are located – consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would retrofit Europe’s 3 million Mercedes cars to reduce its diesel emissions.
No company has called the move a recall.
European carmakers are heavily promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive in price.
As German automakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has been accused of allowing these powerful car companies too much and ignoring signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid a repeat of Volkswagen’s mistake of masking their use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions during car testing to comply with regulations and returning to normal driving conditions.
Several VW executives have been charged in the United States, while others are under investigation by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi’s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zacero Giovanni Paâoe, an Italian, is therefore not under extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was embroiled in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, in which the German government accused it of installing systems to evade European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation, which was previously limited to the United States.
Audi’s investigation could have a major impact on VW: luxury automakers own a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
A film from preparation to release, took a year or two or even a few years, can be described as common.
The animated film "Big Fish Sea Tang" has been announced to be released on July 8, and the film has lasted 12 years from preparation to release!
"Big Fish Haitang" original author Liang, 21 years old from Tsinghua University thermal power professional 脄 industry, and his friend Zhang Chun together to create the other side of the sky, in 2008 won the joint venture fund source of millions of dollars of venture capital, launched the animated film debut "Big Fish Seatang".
The film has won many awards at home and abroad in the creative sample stage, and has been included and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art" by the Centre Pompidou Contemporary Art in France.
Because it took six years from creativity to production, the film was called "God Pit" by millions of fans who were looking forward to the release.
Big Fish Haitang tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese. With the announcement of this archived trailer, it brings new expectations to all audiences.
Liang said: "These 12 years have only done this thing, and now it has changed from a dream to a reality, I am both nervous and excited."
Zhang Chun said: "I always think of using the budget of others one-fiftyth to make the same picture effect as others, and the team will be driven crazy by me."
Dongguan, once a “world factory” that relied on incoming processing and a large number of general workers, is turning its attention to high-level talents who can lead the city to reposition.
Recently, at the high-level talent event held by the Dongguan municipal government, the first financial reporter saw that some local strong enterprises have participated in the talent fair.
On the particularly bright billboards against the orange-red background wall, they each marked a lot of price.
Therefore, the China Television Production Industry Association decided to sign a self-discipline convention with the national TV production industry.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in the south of France, but there is now bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender is decaying due to persistent drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, which is causing headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute in Provence (CRIEPPAM), said: “Lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat because in recent years the plant has been affected by climate change, with heavy rainfall in spring and heavy rains in autumn.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual cicadas, a leaf cicada that can spread tiny bacteria, which appear in large numbers in very dry weather.”
The key is that their numbers are huge.
In addition to attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Chase said: "Contrary to plants that can bloom many large flowers and have long grain ears, we have the problem of small individuals, poor development, lack of or weakness."
So we have less essential oils.”
Solutions being studied include adopting better irrigation techniques and slowing the evaporation of soil moisture, spraying protective mixtures of clay and water on plants, and developing more drought-tolerant varieties.
Compared with the sci-fi elements of the film, the two protagonists have said that they are more attracted to them is the story in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, the reporter of the Huaxi Metropolis Daily interviewed a number of well-known people in the vocal world, as well as two artists, which, surprisingly, were almost always silent.
One is the Berlin Film Emperor, one is a rising young actor, "psychological crime" is also the first partner of Liao Fan and Li Yifeng.
Mexico is in danger and journalists are killed.
All employees of Riodoce’s weekly newspaper typically rallied on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the Sinalo riots, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and an endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over them, and they come together to discuss security.
They are told to change their daily habits, which is important.
Two senior journalists discussed what would feel safer: whether to bring their children to the office, which was hit by a grenade attack in 2009, or whether to keep them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals, and allies.
They asked the journalists to name them under each column—no evidence needed, and observation and intuition were enough.
Suspected of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists, or cartels on the government’s list, are throbbing the work of reporting in Mexico.
Violence has been raging, with more and more journalists: at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 journalists have been protected by the federal protection after attacks and threats, and at least seven journalists have died in seven states so far this year.
The last one to die was their editor and inspiration, and Javier Valdez Cárdenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
In one of the many books on drug violence, Valdez wrote: “The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist.”
You can feel deeply that he’s gone, though he’s everywhere — a huge photo hanging on the front of the Rioodoce office building, Valdez with his middle finger on the middle finger, with the words “justice”; Aaron Ivara and Miriam Ramirez, two T-shirts worn by two 30-year-old journalists, also showed his smile, glasses or his iconic Panamanian straw hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and skepticism.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, the office prosecuted only two people, according to the records of the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is rare to bring the perpetrators of journalists to justice.
In Riodoce, they insist on reporting the violence in Sinalo, though they have broken their hearts, and the land has been porous.
Ibarra said that without information about the killers and justice, it would not be useful to hold a security seminar.
He said, “It’s stupid to waste time attending seminars like this.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anybody."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the capital, Culiacan.
His red Toyota Corolla was stopped only a few blocks away by two men; they forced him to get out of the car and fired 12 shots, guessing because of the name of the newspaper, which translates to Twelve Rivers.
The gangsters drove his car away and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
He left behind his wife and two adult children.
Culiacan is talking nonsense.
But on the subject of Valdez, there was actually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinalo has become the country’s bloodiest battleground, with rival forces fighting wildly.
One or several people are shot every day on the streets of Sinalo, and the cemetery is littered with two or more of apocalcous mausoleums of drug lords, which have become commonplace.
For a moment to forget the “calm” state is a time when only one cartel controls this coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdez was acutely aware of the dangers of the job, Ismail Pohoquire, the co-founder and director of Rioodoce, 60, felt guilty for not protecting his friend.
He believed two mistakes had caused the tragedy.
First, in February, an interview with Damaso Lopez was published, in which he led a cartel that fought several of Guzman’s sons.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspaper was bought out by suspected gang members as soon as it was sent to the newsstand.
The second mistake was that after another newspaper reporting the same story was confiscated, Valdez did not force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to the violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit endures, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
He was also a senior reporter for Nonoeste, who co-founded Riodoce with five colleagues in 2003 and sold a $50 stake.
In Sinalo, Pohoque said, “it is impossible to step foot in journalism without dealing with the drug problem.”
Over time, the paper gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising also increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish investigative reports without fear of censorship, and readers also like newspapers to publish stories that others dare not report.
Five years after its inception, Riodoce won the Maria Moscarpo Journalism Award from the Latin American nation.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdiz the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug coverage.
He admits that he is scared too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the prize, he said, “I want to live on.”
Later in late October, he said in an interview with local TV station Rompeviento TV that “drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinalo.
You must take on the task that falls on your shoulders as a journalist—either so, or pretend to be deaf and dumb.
I don’t want to be asked, ‘What have you done in the face of so many deaths... why don’t you speak out against what’s going on?’”
All the staff of Riodoce miss Valdez, he cursed like a dock worker, a friend who never hesitated for hugging and advising, and who knew how to live.
They depend on their habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar, which often goes across the office, is always seated at the same table.
Now, they will ask: was it his daily habits that caused his fall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
“They don’t like the women and kids you’re giving them trouble, or that you’re affecting their legitimate company and the secret airport used to ship drugs,” Poholique said.
It's all over their bottom line."
The result is that there is a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection, even when it is safest.
Trust your intuition.
If you smell danger, stay away.
The problem, says Riodoce editor Andres Villarière, is that “breath is a feeling that can be deceived ... and then something like Havel’s will happen.”
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply to the states of Sinalo—just as they no longer apply to the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative, and institutions are weak, government officials are corrupt, and ulgas is baked.
The situation is constantly changing.
Cell phones were suddenly not allowed in the room where Riodice employees were attending security training; a few days ago, spyware allegedly sold only to the government had been used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took a cold ride in the shade to escape the 104-degree (40-degree Celsius) heat.
They were sent by the state to protect Riodoce’s offices in a four-story building in the middle class district of Kulycan.
Some reporters half-jokingly joked that they didn’t know if the police would belong to the governor’s own 50 percent of the letter they said.
It has been months since the journalists went to the mountains, where drug cartels are under actual control.
This week’s Rioodoce focused on three major events.
Among them is the killing of the brother of the great former boxer of Sinalo, Julio César Chávez.
and the governor's hometown government funding disclosure,
And the kidnapping inside an expensive restaurant in Kulycan, which is just one block from the prosecutor’s office.
Officials have not released information about the victims of the abductions and the process of kidnapping, so they need to be careful when writing about what the city knows: that this restaurant is a place that drug dealers and officials love to go.
A journalist learned from the public archives that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling PRI party, which dominated the political class almost throughout the last discipline.
Recently, several RPT governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Verarier asked reporters to write about what had happened at the site of the incident, including a son of the Mexican drug lord Guzman, who was hiding from a military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would have looked at Valdez’s column for the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
The 46-year-old Villarreal, who is known as “skinny” because of his thin stature, said, “Before, we already knew what was going on.”
All of our sources of information are now cut off.
Valdez’s office is now being used to store signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, as employees have become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a sign and walked out of the room to the local prosecutor’s office for a march related to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Micoen three days after his death in Valdez.
Officials found a charred body and said that according to DNA tests, this was his body.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests, painting “Save the media” on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Pohokui, who is not in Washington, is trying to get justice for the Valdez case and international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the governor of Sinalo, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Given that her anger has affected her objectivity, she has also called for her resignation from the post covering government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, complicity in government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book, Drug News, he wrote that journalists were not only mutilated by drug cartels, but also on a list of politicians and security forces who malfeated with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articolo 19 blames police and public officials for more than half of last year’s attacks.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die just to shut up."
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, blogger Maria Elisabeth Marcias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “I am here for my report.”
Her head was cut off, next to a computer keyboard and headphones.
After Miroslava Brac was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
The others continued, and the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo in 2014 were killed, but they continued.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front-page news to open a dialogue with the drug cartel, titled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homeland or even left the country.
It is a difficult choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful and alert to danger in the streets.
Sometimes they are arrested, and in 2015 photographer Ruben Espinosa was reportedly killed along with four women in a Mexican city three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, this is a daily dance step for high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admitted that reporting on the drug trade frightened him.
“Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist.”
In the middle of the night on a recent Friday, the latest issue of the newspaper had been printed, and the editors of Riodoce were sitting in the aisle outside the office drinking beer when suddenly their phones rang.
A series of gun battles between gang rival forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan have confirmed dead.
The fighting is escalating, as a series of cartel messages found in the region foreshadowed.
They uploaded the news to Riodoce’s website via their phones on the side of the road.
The next day’s headline had to be changed.
The siren sounded nearby – another life-and-death duel in the area.
Poholique glanced at the policemen standing there on guard, to see if they were alert.
If they are a little afraid, then they are not showing it.
The founder of the newspaper had been killed, and in his large portraits his middle finger pointed to the whole of Sinalo to look, and the entire staff of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
On the same day that Havel was killed, the intern asked me to send her out into the street to report it.
China's self-driving tourism market size in 2020 or exceed one trillion yuan
In the context of consumption upgrading and free travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and more and more consumers like it.
But at the same time, the self-driving travel market, which is expected to break through the trillion-dollar scale, is also facing dual challenges.
In the context of consumption upgrading and free travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and more and more consumers are loved.
But at the same time, is expected to break through the trillion-scale self-driving travel market is also facing a double challenge, on the one hand, the development of the self-driving travel industry and market demand is not proportional, self-driving tour clubs and travel agencies and other self-driving tour organizers are facing the dilemma of meager profitability; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-driving travel are still in the early stage.
60% of the total number of domestic tourists, the market size is expected to break trillions
In 2016, 4.44 billion domestic tourism, self-driving travel accounted for about 60% of the total domestic tourism, by 2020 self-driving travel market is expected to exceed trillion.
According to the statistics of the China Tourism Car Association on the number of self-driving cars, the number of tourists from driving has continued to grow in the past five years, and the proportion of tourists in domestic tourists has stabilized at more than half.
At the same time, regions and countries have shown more attention and support for the emerging field of self-driving travel, and from 2016 to 2017, policies and regulations related to self-driving cars, live cars and camping tourism were intensively introduced.
In July 2017, the National Tourism Administration, the State General Administration of Sports and other eight departments jointly issued the "Automobile Self-Driving Sports Camp Development Plan"; in the same month, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance and other 14 departments jointly issued the "Promoting the Quality Improvement and Upgrading Action Plan for Rural Tourism Development (2017)", self-driving travel was highlighted.
The introduction of policies has provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving travel.
Self-driving club profit is meager, the complete industry chain is the key
Although the domestic self-driving travel market has great potential and national policies are actively guided, the self-driving travel industry is still in the early stage.
According to the "2016-2017 China Self-Driving Tour Annual Development Report", there are thousands of domestic self-driving clubs, car clubs, and carier clubs, etc., but the proportion of tourists self-driving travel accounts for the majority, and the proportion of tourists who participate in various institutions such as car club and self-driving tour club is only about 15%.
At the same time, independent research and development of self-driving travel products online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies are also a handful, many online travel platforms sell only some suppliers to provide self-driving travel products, some self-driving travel clubs are also important suppliers.
From the perspective of organizing self-driving activities, it covers many aspects of "eating, living, traveling, traveling, shopping, and entertainment", with a high degree of fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chain, and large random consumption by tourists.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing World Automobile Club, believes that the self-driving club is similar in nature to travel agencies, and the main profit model in the early days is mainly offline activities, and the core point is self-driving tour line products and leader services.
However, now the line products in the field of self-driving travel are seriously homogeneous, the level of service of the leader is uneven, and the self-driving tour club is facing the need to transform again.
It can be seen that the self-driving tour itself is not an independent industry, but it forms a cross-regional and industry ecological circle with its displacement characteristics, and it is very important to form a complete industrial chain.
Experts pointed out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumer element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving travel industry, the experience characteristics should be enhanced, and the theme of "self-driving travel +" and the IP of self-driving travel products should be developed.
Scenic roads are not only roads, car campsites should not only meet the accommodation
In the face of the rise of self-driving travel, the basic supporting development of self-driving travel is also relatively basic.
Li Guanjie pointed out that the tourist landscape road is not just a road, but also needs to integrate the elements of transportation and tourism, but the road repair and tourism itself are responsible for the two departments, the transportation department to increase the tourism elements, but also stay in the construction of toilets, consulting centers, publicity columns and other facilities, and the combination of tourism is not high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving route "American Highway 66", the construction experience is worth learning from.
Scenic road design is no longer the most direct and quick path between the starting point to the destination, but follows the design concept of "experience driving pleasure" to provide self-driving tourists with the best enjoyment of the beautiful scenery along the road; the scenic road can connect the point-like and face-like tourism landscape, which not only retains the historical value and cultural value of eco-tourism resources along the route, but also holds various theme activities to enhance the participation and leisure experience of tourists, and create economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to the scenic trail, the camp is also an important supporting facility for self-driving tours.
However, among the self-driving tourists known to the Beijing News, there are not many consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps are biased towards infrastructure, which can only meet the needs of eating and living, the grade is not high, and the product is single, which can not meet the needs of self-driving travel, which contains many elements.
Some industry insiders who did not want to be named said that many of the enterprises that did the camp in the past few years were to take the land, and after taking the land, the supporting infrastructure construction and services in the later period did not keep up, and many of the operating conditions were losses, and without the injection of funds in the later period, it was difficult to do some corresponding supporting products.
Consumer groups
According to the data released by the China Tourist Car and Boat Association in 2017, from the perspective of age, the self-driving travel group is concentrated in 21-40 years old, especially 31-40 years old, this part of the population has a certain economic foundation, and the demand for personalized tourism is high, and most of them are parents and children.
From the accommodation survey, the self-driving population is relatively more inclined to non-standard accommodation.
From the perspective of self-driving travel types, the surrounding self-driving is the most important type of self-driving travel, accounting for 84.32%.
Self-driving is the yearning of many people, but the proportion is still small.
At the same time, with the improvement of consumer demand, tourists who used to like to drive "tour attractions" began to change their concept, and they were no longer "aparture in the car to take pictures and get on the bus to sleep" in the process of driving, but more concerned about the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguises to hide from enemies
At first glance, it looks terrible, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have published the first results of an inconceivable fossil of rhino-sized, rhino-sized organisms found by Canadian miners, pointing out that the fossil is well-preserved, so experts call it the “Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world.”
The fossil is so well preserved that it can even determine that its scaly skin is reddish-brown in color. This suggests that it had some "troublesome experiences".
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as “the best-preserved clad dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.”
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodule dragon that lived between the mid-Cracypic Period of 110 million and 212 million years ago.
Its state of preservation is so well-preserved that it shocked researchers, who described it as “really breathtaking.”
According to National Geographic, the herbivorous clad dinosaur fossil is the best-preserved dinosaur fossil of its kind ever found.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil while mining at the Sumberlo Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
At that moment he came across something that seemed to be different from the rocks around him, and he decided to take a closer look.
The fossils he found were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Canada.
It took the researchers six years to reveal the beast inside the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) cavity.
After such a hard work, the final results are now being announced.
"If you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum. The creature is on display at the exhibition.
“It will be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science – the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world.”
By studying their skin, the researchers found that the herbivorous creature, though clothed in armor, like a walking tank, could be a major threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The armored dinosaurs used red and white camouflage to avoid predators, and used concealment known as "anti-shade", a method used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say, it is better able to blend in with its surroundings to avoid enemies, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, a member of the thuneiplankosaur family, made headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
After Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was one of the team members, took 7,000 hours to elaborate on the behemoth, the researchers now study it and named it “Borealopelta Markmitchelli.”
The samples are so well preserved that Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists can record the patterns and shapes of scales and armor on their bodies.
They found “anti-shade” techniques, a common form of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the backs of the species are darker than the color of their sides.
Although “antishade” is common, the results of the discovery are surprising, because the dinosaur species is much larger than the existing animals that use anti-shading.
This dinosaur faced the pressure of being hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, thus evolving in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in the confrontation as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing animals that use anti-shading, such as deer, zebra, or armadillo, are as small and fragile as prey, indicating that the creature is under real pressure to survive.
“The wild predation of large heavy armored dinosaurs shows how dangerous Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs are,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic complex in its scales also showed that the dinosaur's skin color was reddish-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study clues to the creature’s life, including the stomach inclusions it retains to find out what the last food to be eaten.
They believe that dinosaurs fell into the river when they died, then rushed into the sea and finally sank back into the sea.
At the time, Alberta’s climate was as warm as it is in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans could be deeper inland than they are today.
“This nodule dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin and has been preserved in dimensional space so far in dimensional space, so that its original shape can be preserved,” Brown said.
“As a result, the creature is now shaped almost the same as it was during the Cretaceous.
You don't have to use too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping."
The Cretaceous period was a time when large, two-leggedropod dinosaurs roamed the earth.
Although Tyrannosaurus rex was the king of dinosaurs, it appeared millions of years after the gargoyle dinosaurs. The pyrotechnic dinosaurs may have been hunted by some of the progenitors of the Tyrannosaurus rex.
They include the tall spinosaurus, a 6-ton, 38-foot (11.5-meter)-long behemoth.
The latest study found that scientists in the journal Current Biology believe that the nodule dragon was washed into the sea after death and later formed a mummy in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink excavated the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, complete with skin and armor from the nose to the area of the hips.
The creature is about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighs 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch-long sharp corners that protrud from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that the herbivorous lindraped dinosaurs were active in what is now western Canada, after which they were washed into the sea by rivers that erupted in floodwaters.
However, the dinosaur buried the seabed so that the armor can be preserved in its entirety.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are so well preserved that the remaining skin still covers the uneven pieces of nails on the dinosaur skulls.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, this degree of preservation is as rare as the winning color.
The more I looked, the more I thought it was unbelievable.
The remaining fossilized skin still covers the mottled armor on the dinosaur skull.
Its right front palm is located on its side, with five toes unfolding upward.
I can count them."
The reporter learned that the addition of natural or plant-derived algalide, humic acid and amino acid synergistic carriers to the urea production process can improve the traditional urea, the formation of algal urea urea urea, urea urea urea utilization rate increased by 5 to 10 percentage points compared with ordinary urea.
Environmentally friendly, crop yield growth potential is obvious, especially large particles of value-added urea is a high-quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is twice as high as the number of security guards at the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest-ever security linkage program.
Earlier, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would fight together, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police officers.
Most of the troops will be responsible for the stadium, while the 3,000 additional troops will be responsible for security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police patrolled other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 military personnel have arrived in Rio to serve the Olympic security service.
In addition to being in charge of the four major areas of the Rio Olympics, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic venues.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is no longer new, and in order to make the evaluation mechanism effective, it is important to make supervision more effective and not formal.
How did the activists learn to answer the question, “Whose street?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was confused.
On his first day on his trip to New York City, the St. Louis native sat on Airbnb’s rented bed and browsed Facebook on his phone.
She stumbled upon a high school student post.
“The police just killed an 18-year-old child and the child is still lying on the street.”
She was puzzled to find that no one else posted the feed. She turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A @TheePharoah user kept pushing her the dynamic Times.
The St. Louis-area rapper live-streamed the death of Michael Brown. Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown lying on the street with his body missing in vital signs, and his body lay in the street for four hours.
“Crazy,” Ferrell thought.
But death is nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone and didn’t open it again until that evening to read about the crowds on Canfield Avenue.
There were police footage and photos of people shouting, and a photo of a man who claimed to be Brown’s father, which read: “The Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!”
She saw a message from the scene of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer raised his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all of you... the animals."
“It’s not normal,” Ferrer recalled.
“This is not a typical murder we take for granted.”
At that moment, I felt shudder.
I was angry, crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided to head for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrer and Ferguson over the next three years was the subject of a new documentary, “Whose Street?”, which opens in theaters on Aug. 11.
It is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of people who live in this community and are crowded with streets demanding answers.
When Ferrer and his daughter (wearing a floral dress and crown accessory) drove to Ferguson, the two revisited the topic they had discussed countless times before that morning—“on the black experience and the black condition.”
“Do you remember when I taught you that black people had to fight for their faith?” she recalled.
“We are going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is not right.
“I had to take her with me,” Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is the climax of everything that has happened in the past.
She wants to know, see and rise from this.
Not only does she need to develop well in activism and organization, but she needs to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the black situation, and what we have to do to be free and free.
Even though I was lucky enough to give her a racist experience she hadn’t personally experienced, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I'm hurting her."
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop at a site opposite the South Florida Sand Road Police Station. The militant waited until the result of Officer Darren Wilson's final non-prosecution, and the site became their camp.
Ferrer and her daughter contacted a local business owner who made a bagged lunch.
They prepared the bag, which was responsible for passing it on to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new type of activism.
She said, "My activism changed completely after August 9th." When she was an undergraduate at Missouri State University in St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
“I have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came.”
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with film co-director Sabah Foleyan at a night parade.
Fulayan said she and her director of photography, Lucas Alvarado Faller, “just wanted to document” what happened.
Ferrer had a question in his mind: “Do you want to record or do you want to find a story you can use?”
This suspicion stems from many of these cases: People — often white — go into a community to benefit from their pain and tenacity.
As Foleyan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the native people in Ferguson didn’t focus their voices, and we wanted to do it differently.”
Forlayan has been in contact with co-director Dimon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism against death row inmates.
His involvement led Ferrell to join the “Whose Street?” project team with six other locals, and for several years after Brown’s shooting.
“This documentary is not about someone talking to us or talking to us, this is what we’re saying,” Davis said.
“I’m mainly concerned about how these characters are presented, because that’s how I’m presented.”
While the goal was not to focus on Ferrer’s experience — it was to show that the movement was “not about the savior leader, but about community cohesion,” Forlayan said — it turned out she was the most open of the film’s participants.
As a result, “Whose Street?” is a surprising account of Ferrer’s personal life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I feel naked,” Ferrell laughed as she first saw the finished product.
“But I understand that to do this work and humanize black people, there has to be a certain degree of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrer’s story reaffirms and repositions the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement’s three founders — who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media following the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevoron Martin — were identified as queer.
“Black queer women in the leadership generally support this movement,” Ferrell said, “because we’re fighting on multiple fronts.”
Black queer women have to endure all of this."
Forlayan agreed and mentioned that "this movement really has the support of black women and many black queer women."
Because of her identity, Ferrell was chosen as the centerpiece of the film. However, she insisted that "this was not a positive act for things".
“She’s the one who inspires that energy,” she said.
"Although she's on the front lines, it's no coincidence. Because in these crossroads lives, as a black queer woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras are long gone, but strained race relations between the community and the police persist.
Ferrer was given more than two-and-a-half-year suspended sentences for trying to block the highway during a parade.
She described the socio-political climate in the area of what she called home: “a mess.”
Still, since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has insisted on the chants she has worked to remember.
“We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We are indisputable, except the chains on our bodies.”
In fact, online translation services were already available on the Internet a decade ago, but in fact, a long time ago, the argument that machines were about to replace humans for translation was endless.
Similarities: Artist uses Chelsea Manning’s DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the pavilion at the Friedmann Museum in New York, there are multiple faces: white, black and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each face, and these faces are tied by wires hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using a cotton swab and hair crumbs sent to her face by Chelsea Manning.
Manning, who sent crumbs from the Levenworth prison for leaking classified diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks, was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The exhibition opened on August 2 with the title “Consider.”
This is the result of two years of communications between Dewey Hager and Manning, who combines his disciplines with his own in technology, computer science, and the arts, while Manning, a prominent dissident, has been jailed and has completed sex reassignment surgery in prison. Former U.S. President Barack Obama pardoned her remaining sentences three days before the end of his term.
By performing an algorithmic analysis from Manning's DNA, 30 portraits of "probably possible appearances" were created. Heather Dewey Harberger made a sharp and slightly merciless comment. His comments were both about the plethreic nature of DNA and the concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, publicly admitted to identifying herself as a woman during her adolescence. He was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six counts of espionage law violations, computer fraud, and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photograph, a grainy black-and-white selfie that looked visibly uneasy, sitting in the driver’s seat with a platinum-gold wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Haberg achieved great success with her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In that piece, she used physical evidence from the middle court of cigarette butts and gum to create 3D portraits of people who might resemble their looks.
She received an email from Paper magazine.
“They wanted to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and needed a portrait,” Heather Doweh Harberger told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn’t visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
So the artist and her imprisoned muse became improbable pen pals, exchanging many letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, The Repressed Head, by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book envisions the president granting privileges to Manning in the future, and she will be able to see the exhibition in prison.
Obama called for her release just days after the book was published. It may have been a coincidence that Manning spent his seventh year in the Kansas military prison.
In addition, the exhibition has another meaning. Because in contemporary America, the Trump administration is constantly declaring war on government leakers and transgender military personnel, and at the same time finding new ways to hype it on Twitter to nakedly incite division, and this exhibition is to bridge such divisions.
Asked about all this special timing, Heather Dewey Harberger said, “There’s a reason for anything that happens.”
In an artist’s statement written on the gallery’s wall, Manning’s oversized signature is below (the “i” in the name is drawn with a heart) calling for an end to “the partisan fiery image based on gender, sexual orientation, and culture.”
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, twisted with pencil twists and writes the Cs, Gs, and As symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist’s complex scientific dictionary), Heather Dewey Haaberg hopes to express this, at least in its physiological structure, by depicting these strangely similar portraits.
“I want people out of this predicament, that our genomes don’t care about who we are, how the published genetic data is interpreted, and how subjective it is,” said Heather Dewey Harberger, whose 2007 video, False Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, so that's 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in a novella illustrated in the previous illustration.
Shown in the United States soldiers holding loudspeakers under the flamboyant, King Kong shape Manning.
“When they make your speech stop, they win,” the wall reads.
“Don’t shut up.”
“The content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me,” the artist from Philadelphia said.
"I'm just afraid, I'll still say."
Manning hasn’t seen the show in person, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she’ll be greeted by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters getting cheers in the center of the pavilion.
It was also purposeful, like all the items in the exhibition, to the height of her genetic haplogroup information written in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning’s height).
“In the past, I hung them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a group of people,” Dewey Hagerburg said of the portrait.
“But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting to release her.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for homicide
Police said a man was found to have been fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago, and a Northwestern university professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted and were currently searching for suspects across the country.
Cook County court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Wyndham Lessem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested for a first-degree unbailless murder warrant for the alleged death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranlo.
According to the records, 26-year-old Cornell Duranlo died from multiple stab wounds.
A community alert from the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
Police arrived at Grand Plaza apartment after receiving a phone call and found multiple lesions on the victim’s body.
Police said Cornell Duranello died at the scene, detectives are investigating his killing, and police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lesham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern since 2007.
Alan K. Cobage, deputy director of campus relations, said in an emailed statement that Lesham had now left and had been barred from Northwestern’s campus.
“Now this is a criminal case that the relevant authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation.”
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for Somerville College, Oxford, said in an emailed statement: “We are in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist U.S. investigative agencies as needed.”
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department’s chief liaison officer, strongly encouraged the suspect to turn himself in to authorities.
Guliermy said, “The police already have a rough idea of their whereabouts, and we are working to locate the possible locations.”
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were doing all their might to help search the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the manager of Grand Plaza, who had just received a secret tip that something had happened at Apartment 1008.
Police said the situation was horrific.
Guglielmi said it was not clear whether the incident also occurred on July 27.
He said that based on security cameras, it was confirmed that lesham and Warren were in the building at the time.
“We believe that Professor Reisma has a certain relationship with the victims,” Guglielmy said.
Grand Plaza’s management team issued a statement to residents saying: “Police are currently studying the victim’s timeline and background and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said: "We will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency road map in the near future."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vittko said that the implementation of the remaining standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) against the restoration of the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will not take too long.
“The implementation of the roadmap standards has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard,” Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the remarks in commenting on the second part of the WADA road map, Compliance. This section sets the criteria for restoring RUSADA rights and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not contain anything that may cause concern for Russia.
He added, “Everything has to be announced, everything will be implemented.”
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future.”
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of the WADA-approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on the Russian state’s support for doping in the country’s sport.
Speaking about the incident, Mutko said: "We are investigating and there is no doubt that our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind this, and we will not recognize what does not exist.”
Mutko responded to the words of the head of Russia’s Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission, Vittry Smirnov.
Smirnov acknowledged the problems of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in the past in an interview with the Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, but added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations."
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally," Smirnov said.
Following the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA’s right to conduct doping checks in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Negli, during a visit to the group’s headquarters in Moscow in July, said RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” in an effort to restore its rights.

No more need to buy! these more than 8000 products zero tariff
At the regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, the spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce said that as of now, there are 15 free trade agreements that have been implemented in China, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 kinds of zero-tariff imports.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, ASEAN tropical fruits... you want these products no longer have to spend a lot of money to buy.
At present, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, and 15 have been implemented, covering more than 8,000 kinds of zero-tariff imports.
Taking agricultural products as an example, with the implementation of the free trade agreement, consumers can taste agricultural products from different sources and high quality and low price all year round.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durian, lychee and dragon fruit, the import tariff has been reduced from 15% to 30% to zero.
The import tariff on Icelandic salmon has been reduced from 10% to 12% to zero.
For Georgian and Chilean wines, the import tariff has been reduced from 14% to 30% to zero.
There are also special agricultural products such as beef and milk powder in New Zealand that have been significantly reduced.
For example, the import tariff on some cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero;
Some watch import tariffs are reduced by 50% and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
South Korea's refrigerators, rice cookers, massagers, beauty machines and other products import tariffs reduced by 40%, and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
There are also large-scale tax cuts in consumer electronics.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the free trade zone also include many intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of domestic terminal consumer goods, and also promoted the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods to a certain extent.
Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said that nearly one-third of China's total imports can enjoy preferential tariffs in the free trade agreement, most of which are terminal consumer goods, which has brought tangible benefits to consumers.
Further Reduction of Import Tariffs on Consumer Goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted the import tariffs on some consumer goods to further reduce import tariffs on consumer goods, covering food, health care products, drugs, daily necessities, clothing, shoes and hats, household equipment, cultural entertainment, daily department stores and other consumer goods, involving 187 8-bit tax numbers.
The average tax rate on this batch of consumer goods will be reduced from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost "cut off"!
Since January 1, 2018, China has also made some adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
The import tariff on some cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow, and perfume was reduced from 10% to 5%.
After reducing tariffs, it means that consumers do not have to buy on behalf of the company, and they do not need to go abroad to buy favorite foreign products.
2018 Yiwu Import Goods Shopping Festival: imported red wine, snacks, fruits... all are cheap!
Foreign reports: the year-end U.S. shopping regulations are very different, and shopping returns need to be cautious
The New Network December 29
According to the United States "World Daily" reported that just after Christmas, the return tide.
According to ABC, more than half of the goods sold last Christmas were returned.
In addition, some readers have repeatedly broke the news that online shopping has been cheated, and consumers need to pay more attention to when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts or e-commerce purchases from some small stores, you must be careful.
Ms. Langogang's Ms. Hou local time on December 1st in a special online shop specializing in selling printed coats, spent more than 60 yuan (dollars, the same below) to buy a coat, the results have not been sent.
She sent an email to the customer service and did not reply.
Another netizen broke the news that he traveled to the United States last year to buy a mobile phone from a third-party seller, and found that it was a box of rubber puree.
After knowing that you have been cheated, apply for a refund from the website, and get a full refund.
But some customers believe that the website refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident in Northern California, said that he had twice purchased an expedited delivery service for a website, and once for four yuan, but it was not delivered on time twice.
After that, the refund was requested and no response was received.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Most Macy’s products are fully refunded within 180 days.
However, the goods must remain "original" and require proof of purchase such as a receipt or bank purchase record.
If there is no voucher, customers can also get mall points, which can be used to purchase other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general goods, and electronic products are usually 15 days.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment goods purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 has been extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period is from December 25, which means that it must be returned before January 25, 2018.
The ultimate shopping experience, the new era of business district shopping development
More than a decade ago, China was still in the seller's market as a whole, and people's choices were limited and their needs were limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has already achieved a change from the seller's market to the buyer's market, and now the taste of consumers has become more sophisticated, and they are no longer satisfied with the simple "pay-and-hand delivery" shopping behavior.
Therefore, how to get consumers to an extreme shopping experience has become the next competition point for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect the consumer shopping experience, the impact of shopping centers in the business district is the most significant.
See how city builders focus on the shopping experience.
There are no two completely identical leaves in the world, and there are no two completely identical shopping centers, and a famous shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping mall, its unique wave-shaped architectural design is inspired by the Grand Canyon (Canyon), so it is named the homophonic Kanyon, walking in the Kanyon 200 meters of the minister's trail as if in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is also a large-scale inward-concaving large-scale oval performance venue in the center of the shopping center, with a unique appearance and often holding special performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk in each floor can look down on the activities carried out in the "canyon", and has the effect of shifting scenery.
At home, Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China's first forest-style strolling consumer market, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
7000 square meters of green square, 3000 square meters of roof water platform, the project consists of 9 single buildings, the building between the air corridors connected, the overall sinking courtyard design, taking the edge of the French sycamore tree for the building skin, roof water roof roof, to create a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest mole is like accidentally falling into the rabbit hole in Alice's Adventures, climbing along the trunk of the building, the grass, the springs, the people into the forest full of vitality and vitality.
There are also in Chongqing, Longhu built Lijia waterfront business district, planning business, planning more than 50 international top-selling flagship stores in the future, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign famous brands, to become a service industry agglomeration, distinctive theme of the commercial center.
Not only that, the Lijia waterfront business district will also be ecologically integrated into the building, TOD public transportation as the guide, set fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education, sports in one, in order to bring consumers the ultimate shopping experience at the same time also lead them to enjoy Chongqing's unique "waterside culture", shopping and water entertainment, leisure perfect integration.
In summary, it can be found that at present, some housing companies have insight into the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry insiders said that this consumer experience as the center, how to combine shopping and experience consumption mode will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
Today's business district is not only a distribution center for goods, but also a comprehensive place that integrates artistic culture and creative themes, and also carries people's responsibility for urban living.
Therefore, while meeting the one-stop material needs of consumers eating, drinking and playing Tesco, maximizing the multi-level spiritual needs of culture and art, and giving play to the livable housing needs, it is bound to be the commanding heights of the future development of the business district.
In Chongqing, the north shore of Guoxing, is located in Jiangbei, near Guanyin Bridge, the essence of world business, the international giant around, first-class brands gathered, and the international fashion is close to the connection.
Here, the prosperity of the world, the essence of the world;
Dongyuan Jinyue has a better shopping environment, Dongyuan Jinyue near the Nanping business district, exclusive to the west and even the country's leading four-level three-dimensional transportation system, enhance shopping comfort.
In addition, the landscaping and landscape pavement of the two pedestrian streets of Huigong Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded, about 300 trees have been planted, and 40,000 square meters have been transformed, which has improved the image of the Nanping business district;
And Longhu Yuhu No. 1, close to Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business district - Lijia Waterfront Business District, surrounded by nine parks, low density of commercial blocks, high degree of openness, making people more willing to stay, stop, slowly enjoy the fun of shopping, rather than being surrounded by the people behind the rush to rush forward, truly realize the "walking shopping".
Today's business competition will only become more and more fierce, how to kill a bloody road in the homogenization of the serious market, won the reputation of "shopping mecca" in the hearts of consumers in the future, worthy of serious consideration by all real estate developers.
It is not enough to rely on the differentiation strategy alone, only those developers who really put consumers in their hearts, eager consumers, want to think that consumers think, to provide consumers with the ultimate and simple shopping experience can laugh in the storm coming to the market.
Of course, in the end, I think the people who are most happy is Chongqing, with such a good shopping experience and business circle, in 10 years ago, no one can imagine today's prosperity.
Consumerism Carnival to cover up real environmental prices
166.2 billion yuan, this is November 11, 2017, "Tmall double eleven global carnival" within 24 hours, Tmall user consumption turnover.
Specifically, after the start of "double 11", in just 3 minutes, Tmall turnover exceeded 10 billion yuan, 6 minutes and 05 seconds exceeded 20 billion yuan, and 9 hours broke 100 billion yuan.
On this day, the total number of payments made by global consumers through Alipay reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41% over last year.
These purchases will result in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether it is Tmall online shopping platform or Alipay payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that on November 11, the "Singles Day" subculture created by single young people for self-deprecation will be compiled by e-commerce and become the "double 11" shopping carnival of today's phenomenon.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the marketing gimmick of "Singles Day promotion" for the first time: no one is in love with you, so the "single dogs" come online shopping.
The result was surprising, on this day, Taobao Mall ("Tmall" predecessor) trading turnover exceeded 52 million yuan, which was 10 times the daily transaction volume at that time.
Since then, "double 11" has become Alibaba to create a shopping carnival, from the beginning of the domestic buyers and sellers to entertain themselves, and now the influx of global merchants, nine years later, Tmall "double 11" 100 billion transaction volume has been more than 3,200 times that year, so that "Black Friday" is beyond the dust.
Follow the trend of Tmall "double eleven" promotion, there are many e-commerce, of which "Jingdong" is the strongest.
"Jingdong" has its own shopping festival "6.18", but there is no "double 11" impact, this year from November 1 to 11, "Jingdong" cumulative sales reached 127.1 billion yuan.
After the "double 11", followed by a similar "double 12" discount carnival and Christmas and New Year shopping schedule.
Crossing the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers also before the Spring Festival of the annual purchase period, Valentine's Day shopping schedule, consumption, will not be on holiday.
The environmental problems brought about by instantaneous mass consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua Daily Telegraph, according to the usual standard of 0.2 kg per box in the industry, it is estimated that at least 300,000 tons of garbage will be generated during this year's "double 11" period.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution prevention and control project of Greenpeace East Asia Division, told the Sino-foreign dialogue that this year's "double 11" only Tmall's order volume will produce 160,000 tons of packaging waste.
The State Post Bureau issued a report in 2016 that it pointed out that during the "double 11" period in 2015 (November 11 to 16), the volume of express shipments was about 780 million, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 9.922 billion boxes, 16.985 billion meters of tape, and the length of the tape can circle the Earth's equator 425 times.
This year, the State Post Bureau expects that the "double 11" express business volume is expected to exceed 1.5 billion.
Wang Shi, manager of a waste incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that the daily garbage entering the field after "double 11" exceeded 2,000 tons, which also exceeded the processing capacity of the incineration station.
The courier company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry cannot be considered.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, have launched recyclable and reusable plastic express boxes before "double 11", recycling bags that can be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags, etc., but the acceptance of troublesome consumers is not high.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in Weibo.
This microblog has gained more than 68,000 "likes".
What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war launched in Germany is not expected.
WeChat Pay and Alipay have only moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, and the grabbing positions has not changed - the Chinese, this is also global?
Where there is a payment, there must be a micro-payment.
According to the agreement with German electronic payment service provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially started landing in Germany in November this year, and gradually laid out merchants in Europe.
The foreign reunion of the two "fellows" took place in Europe.
Alipay and WeChat Pay have been singing on the road of globalization.
For the globalization of mobile payment in China, iResearch's "China Third-Party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017" is summarized as two kinds: First, through strategic investment, experience output, equity and support for foreign local mobile payment companies.
The second is to promote mobile payment services to foreign merchants through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, thereby changing the awareness and acceptance of Chinese mobile payment in foreign countries.
In fact, the Chinese have to get the world.
With China’s rapid economic development, coupled with its large population base, the spending of Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure.
But this is also doomed, this time in Germany to open the Chinese mobile payment war is not expected.
WeChat Pay and Alipay are just moving the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the position of snatching or not - or the Chinese, which is also considered to be globalization?
The more pioneering question is whether China's mobile payment can expand in Europe?
Take Germany for example.
The “new retail” by magic.
Chen Yilei and Yang Kaihan: Amazon announced its entry into bookstores and grocery stores when it squeezed into the world's top ten retailers, regardless of the timing and motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the start of 2017, Amazon opened stores in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
At about the same time, Amazon announced its unmanned supermarket (Amazon Go) trial operation, customers do not need to queue up, do not need to checkout, enter the code, take the desired goods to leave, the amount of shopping will be automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, in recent years, it has suddenly been a very unexpected thing to act frequently on the physical store.
As early as 2007, in the "Open Letter to Shareholders", CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon will not easily open physical stores unless the following four conditions are met at the same time:
We must be confident that this new opportunity will return to shareholders’ investments.
We must be confident that this new opportunity is significant for the entire company.
We must be confident that this new opportunity is being ignored by the market.
We must be confident that in this market, we have enough resources to differentiate our customers.
Bookshops and grocery stores are the most shaky classifications of the two physical retails and the first to fall after Amazon’s rise.
Amazon announced its entry into both physical markets as it squeezed into the world’s top 10 retailers, and both timing and motivations are interesting.
Is Amazon’s approach contrary to the assurances in the shareholder letter?
A similar voice was heard on the other side of the globe. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou-Yunqi Conference, Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba's Board of Directors, delivered a keynote speech.
He said: "From next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the term 'e-commerce'.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon end, and the next ten or twenty years will not have e-commerce, replaced by “new retail”.
Online, offline and logistics together, will produce new retail.”
For a time, the three words of "new retail" were like magic, and they were frequently hung on their lips by the industry.
What does “new retail” mean?
If you just mean the combination of online and offline, then this concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked the 180 largest e-commerce companies and estimated that total e-commerce sales were about $200 billion, with the largest 25 accounting for more than $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have only started online in the past five years (such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
Alibaba Group's 28.3 billion yuan investment in Suning Cloud Merchants is also vivid.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are moving from a single channel to an omnichannel retail system covering physical stores, e-commerce, mobile and social media.
Is Ma Yun mentioning "new retail" more as a summary rather than a vision for the future?
If not, then what is the difference between the concept of omni-channel and "new retail"?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not whether online and offline will be integrated, but how to integrate.
Looking back over the past 20 years, the rise of e-commerce, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, e-commerce has moved products with a very high degree of standardization, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, e-commerce has extended its tentacles to other categories and begun to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "using the ideas and technologies of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, so that the increasingly upgraded consumer demand of Chinese consumers can be effectively met, making the entire process of commodity production, circulation and service become more efficient because of the widespread use of the Internet and big data."
Therefore, the road of e-commerce is a road of surface-light assets and actual heavy assets.
"Light" refers to fixed assets, staffing, management processes and other burdens are not as large as traditional retail; "heavy" refers to the need for huge investment in logistics, warehousing and other aspects.
The change of logistics methods ensures the efficiency of e-commerce.
According to the Chinese government network, Premier Li Keqiang hosted an executive meeting of the State Council on April 28, which concluded that expanding domestic consumption demand is an important measure to stabilize growth and adjust the structure.
The meeting determined that the relevant departments should urgently come up with specific plans on the basis of scientific evaluation.
Some of the foreign consumer goods with large domestic consumer demand will be piloted to reduce import tariffs by the end of June this year, and gradually expand the scope of tax reduction commodities;
In combination with the reform of the tax system, we will improve the consumption tax policy of mass consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics, and adjust the scope, tax rate and collection link in an integrated manner;
Add and restore duty-free shops at ports of entry, reasonably expand duty-free varieties, increase a certain amount of duty-free shopping, and facilitate domestic consumers to buy foreign products in China;
We will further promote the facilitation of overseas passengers' shopping customs clearance and tax refunds, and strictly implement the requirements for entry goods to actively declare taxes in accordance with the law.
Formulate inspection and quarantine policies to support cross-border e-commerce imports, and clean up unreasonable fees for import links;

On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty alleviation summit in Chongqing, announcing that it would promote accurate poverty alleviation and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of "Internet + poverty alleviation".
This is after the proposed rural strategy, the launch of the rural Taobao project, the on-line agricultural poverty alleviation platform, the establishment of Alibaba poverty alleviation fund, Ali on poverty alleviation again "plus".
Poverty alleviation is one of the most important national strategies in China.
Total poverty eradication in China has not been achieved in the past few thousand years.
"E-commerce poverty alleviation is an innovative measure for a new round of poverty alleviation and development, and is an important starting point for achieving accurate poverty alleviation and accurate poverty alleviation."
The central government attaches great importance to and points out that it can play the role of the Internet in promoting poverty alleviation, promote precision poverty alleviation and precision poverty alleviation, and let agricultural products go out of the countryside through the Internet."
Therefore, Ali put forward the rural strategy as early as 2014, and with big data cloud computing and globalization as Ali's three core strategies in the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the rural Taobao (Village Tao) project to recruit "Village No. 2" in the countryside to lead farmers to get rid of poverty through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali cooperated with the business department to build a poverty alleviation channel for farmers, and currently has a total of 13 provinces and 120 national poverty-stricken counties.
There are 2118 Taobao villages spawned by Ali platform.
Of these, nearly 400 are in provincial poverty-stricken counties and 33 in 13 national poverty-stricken counties.
In 2017, on Alibaba's China retail platform, Taobao Village sales nationwide reached 120 billion yuan.
Zhang Yong said that in the face of the national strategy of poverty alleviation, Ali has been thinking about how to make good use of the innovation capabilities of Ali's economy such as science and technology, big data, and cloud computing to find a new way out of poverty.
Among them, Murakoma is the main carrier platform for Ali e-commerce to get rid of poverty, and has passed a new link for direct marketing of the Internet to get rid of poverty.
In the planting process, village tao and Ant Financial jointly carried out agricultural tools and small loan support.
In 2017, among 832 national poverty-stricken counties, Ant Financial served 795, providing them with convenient payment, credit and other services.
Cainiao solves warehousing and logistics, Tmall is responsible for sales, Alibaba Cloud's big data backfeed to guide agricultural production, and further improve the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talents.
Ali through Taobao University to open e-commerce courses, to teach farmers standardized, quality and large-scale planting methods, to achieve the "poverty alleviation + to help the mind" combination, so that farmers can sustainably get rid of poverty.
These courses already cover about 92 per cent of the country ' s poor counties.
The idea of "public welfare mentality and commercial means" of poverty alleviation can also ensure that Ali achieves "true poverty alleviation" when poverty alleviation is achieved.
Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, once said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and wealth.
Poverty alleviation is to give people fish, poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, and to get rich is to make a "fish pond" for farmers, so that farmers can have fish to raise.
The industrial poverty alleviation driven by e-commerce is the fish pond.
In terms of industrial poverty alleviation, the poverty alleviation model of Luochuan apple industry created by Ali and Shaanxi Luochuan has been copied and promoted nationwide as an example by relevant departments.
Ali e-commerce poverty alleviation work has also been recognized by the decision-making level.
E-commerce companies represented by Alibaba have been sent messages to ensure that farmers increase production and income through online and offline channels.
Some village Xiaoyi and Ant Financial employees were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of e-commerce poverty alleviation.
At present, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme has been working with the village to carry out e-commerce industry poverty alleviation in Anhui and other places.
The "Third New Economy Think Tank Conference" jointly organized by Ali Research Institute and China Vision Think Tank was held on January 16, and Zhang Li, director of the E-commerce Institute of the Research Institute of the Ministry of Commerce, attended and spoke.
She believes that our globalization has actually overlooked the most important issues, that is, the body and use of globalization, as well as the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people think that globalization has stagnate, and many developed and developing countries have different attitudes towards globalization in the new stage, and they are different models.
The second concept is the question of the mid-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
It is limited by the economic environment that globalization has changed precisely because the economic foundation has changed.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment at the end of 2017 is basically over, and a new round of growth will enter a new round of growth after 2018, and the next round of growth must be driven by raw products.
Jingdong's first fresh supermarket 7FRESH recently officially opened, plans to lay more than 1000 stores in the country in the next three to five years.
Coupled with Ali's box of fresh, Yonghui's super species, Suning's Su fresh, the U.S. group's palm fish fresh, "new retail stores" began to appear, and in the innovative model and even price of each other "called board".
The battle for fresh supermarkets has become a phenomenon-level topic in the new retail field, where is the new retail?
"In 2018, we will quickly enter the country, and we will open a lot of stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival."
Huoma Fresh Life CEO Hou Yi revealed the "new approach" for 2018 at the second New Retail Summit on the 10th.
"Since 2018, Box Horse is not just a fresh e-commerce, but a lifestyle e-commerce that meets the immediate service of consumers."
The core mode is drainage and experience, and online is real sales.”
Different from traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets, Box Horse Fresh is a fun and delicious "net red shop" in the eyes of many consumers, and even intermediaries have played the concept of "box room".
Online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers have their own advantages and disadvantages, but consumers are appearing in a variety of channels, so both sides are trying to use the omni-channel model.
The industry believes that in the context of consumption upgrading, there will be more and more "box horse" stores in 2018.
The Box Horse has continuously explored more consumption areas from the initial freshness, indicating that in the new year, there will be more innovation in the retail market.
"For example, the combination of online and offline business model, attracted the attention of consumers, fresh supermarkets around the call and cheered."
"But these relationships say no more, no more dazzling is useless, and finally implemented to whether you bring a good experience to consumers, I experience well is willing to pay."
In the view of Yuan Bin, co-CEO of Darunfa FeiNiu Network, in the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed, and the purchase demand has also changed.
The original pure online, offline is fragmented, the line to beat the line, the line to counterattack the line, is now hand in hand, because consumers no longer have the distinction between online and offline.
The rush of capital to enter the market makes the new retail gunpowder represented by fresh supermarkets.
According to the analysis, the current competition of new retail in first-tier cities is far from the pattern of the Red Sea, and there are still large second-tier cities that have yet to be tapped, and the market still has great opportunities and space.
Different types of industries for the layout of new retail, will bring the development of new retail into a diversified development state.
CCTV financial channel and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences financial strategy research institute, to comb a dry goods, is the heavy annual development report of China's e-commerce.
What kind of report card has Chinese e-commerce companies come up with this year?
What are the trends in global e-commerce?
Let’s reveal one for everyone.
Total sales record growth rate back to the accelerated track
Since 2006, China's online retail sales can be said to have been showing super high-speed growth, it is estimated that at that time, online shopping is very fresh, do not go out to buy things, too cool!
However, since 2013, the growth rate of online retail has begun to fall below 50%, and in 2015, the growth rate was below 40% for the first time, and the growth rate in 2016 actually became 26.2%.
But this year the situation is different, online retail sales accelerated again, from January to September this year, the growth rate rebounded to 34.2%.
Much higher than the growth rate in 2015 and 2016.
Perhaps everyone walks around and around, and find that it is more physically and mentally pleasing to buy or buy.
Among them, the online retail sales of physical goods were nearly 5.08 trillion yuan, and the online retail sales of services were nearly 1.49 trillion yuan.
The proportion of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6%, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.
Students, do not fall asleep, focus, service online retail sales is definitely a big hero ah!
Secondly, French netizens who love to chop their hands, have a per capita online purchase of $1,925, and the most purchased goods online are clothing, which is a country that loves fashion.
Do you love shopping online, is it a young person?
Helps you avoid the company becoming the next Uber startup
Amy Errett once wanted to investigate employee well-being at her e-commerce startup, but the survey didn’t work.
The responses received are often vague, unhelpful, and even worse, deceptive.
Even though she promised anonymity, some employees still distrust the process.
Ms. Erret, which manages the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company, said she “lacks consistency and objectivity in the responses.”
So she called for help.
A new batch of HR startups has sprung up to help companies understand how employees feel.
They build and license software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to quickly conduct polls on specific teams and population groups, provide anonymity and complaint hotlines for employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives reporting directly to boards.
“Right now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where’s the company’s Fitbit?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint. Glint’s software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Within three years, she used Glint to gain more insight into what employees think and feel.
In addition to rapid surveys and polls for specific teams, Glint offers a company heat map, which units complain the most, and which managers approve scores low, at a glance — which gives her insight into why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must be skilled in controlling the company's workplace culture so as not to become the next Uber. Former Uber employees previously published a blog post describing the harassment environment, and these speakers were punished by the company, and Uber was then caught up in a scandal.
For startups like Glint, this desire to do so is a money-and-go business opportunity.
According to Let’s Talk Payments, the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth more than $11.87 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado, a startup focused on helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity in this area during Uber’s reputation tarnished earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnostic” surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides an anonymous texting hotline to allow employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent, said: “The Court of Public Opinion has usurped the power of regulators.
If a company is found to be bad at treating its employees or acting unethically, even if regulators don’t step in, it could face high consequences of consumer boycotts, employee churn and involvement in lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 2,500 employees across more than 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees understand work guidelines and procedures and provide easy access to corporate headquarters.
Until then, if employees want to report a problem, they must find a phone number or email from the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that the headquarters can take it seriously.
It’s often a daunting and unsettling experience, says James Witlano, Ruby Tuesday’s general counsel, who believes there’s no good way to track employee complaints.
But now the company uses Convercent to more quickly identify and address issues that were previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities or states — such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage behavior.
“I can get a closer, 360-degree view of the work experience,” says Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation.”
Quinlan said that after the collapse of the accounting firm in Andorran due to the safety scandal, companies began to pay more attention to ethics, values and employee engagement since 2002.
But it wasn’t until “social media went into its own world” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their revelations from spreading virally online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy,” he said.
Glint and Convercent both provide their software as a service and charge companies recurring charges for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunity are backed by venture capitalists, who already support the two startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital up to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of companies, cultures, and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research shows that today’s employees expect more from the workplace than they do before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high-paying water and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to join the company, feel that their voices are being heard, and the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company successful,” said Nina McCartney, LinkedIn’s vice president of global welfare and employee experience. LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when their employees are loyal and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it’s no surprise that they’re looking for financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it’s important to have employee engagement data.
However, unless the company’s administrators take action, the data is useless.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can expect the company to change.
If the change doesn’t go fast enough, or if it doesn’t make a little bit of progress, it can bring disappointment and cause employees to leave the company.
Russell Russ, head of consulting at business management firm Cote International, said: "If you want to seek 4,000 suggestions, then you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations." He has seen some companies make mistakes in relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t follow up the whole time, the employee will think, ‘Did you really hear me?’
Do you care?
If you don’t care, why should I care?”
Errett said Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action on the day Glint reports the issue.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustrations with decision-making speed and quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by restructuring the company’s internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees, and in the long run, they want to make a shift in the industry, known for its high turnover rate, to better retain them.

NCAA Cancels Twice-Day Training, Extends Daytime Training Hours for the Bears
As time was approaching 11 p.m., UCLA football team members lingered next to the team’s new campus practice range.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts, revealing their sweaty bodies after hard training on the first day of training.
For a large part of the team, this free few minutes is a rest time.
Players taking summer classes will return to their dormdom after three hours of practice to prepare for the final exam, and then return to Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 the next morning to attend the meeting.
“The next three days are a kind of run-in for these guys,” Bears coach Jim Mora said as he heads into Tuesday on Monday.
The NCAA canceled two daily exercises (designed to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their daytime training hours — at least until the end of Friday.
That’s why UCLA’s first three training sessions are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the schedule that players have already squeezed.
From canceling training twice a day to more training once a day, the Bears began training almost a week before last season, with Mora training at summer school for the first time in six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions on August 20 before they prepare for the official game of their first Texas Agro-Producer in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA’s rule-making, though it adds another program to the player’s busy schedule.
“In three or four days, we would give them a huge amount of training, which was very challenging,” Mora said.
"They've just passed. They're honing, they're all great kids.
I think about Saturday and we're going to have more time, it's really great."
The training camp ends with UCLA stopping training. This is not an easy task, given the clear line of sight in the adjacent parking lot and the Luskin Center. The Luskin Center Premium Hotel has been bruised by football thrown through the guard net behind the goalposts.
Starting this weekend, the Bears will be staying at the hotel. But Mora admits that problems can arise once the rooms are empty during the season.
“We’re going to take security measures,” Mora said.
"It's a real concern. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room to record a training scene is not far-fetched.
If you have a training videotape, it’s pretty good.
But we will take security measures there, and we will take security measures in parking lot 8.
We will use the resources available to do our best.
I won’t worry too much about that.
We have a plan in place.”
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data shows that in the second quarter of this year, the value of houses across Australia rose by an average of 1.5% to 2%, an annual increase of 3.5%, the lowest annual increase since March 2013.

IT House reported in the morning that the Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T had canceled plans to sell Huawei's new flagship smartphone in the United States.
Huawei had planned to announce the partnership at CES this week, and AT&T canceled the partnership at the last minute.
In response to this situation, Huawei responded to the surging news reporter on January 9 that on January 9, local time in the United States, Huawei will release new products and specific listing information to the US market.
Huawei said that in the past five years, Huawei has proved its strength by launching high-end products in the global and US markets.
According to the previous report of the IT home, Huawei will release a "best mobile phone you have never heard of" at the CES show in Las Vegas on the afternoon of January 9, and the battery life of this phone can support two days of use.
The industry generally believes that Huawei's upcoming release of this flagship phone is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro equipped with the Android Oreo system.
Yangcheng Evening News reporter Wang Li led by Fan Bingbing, Guo Tao, Dapeng, Zhang Jiaxing and other films starring "I am not Pan Jinlian" will be released nationwide on September 30.
Yesterday, the film held a seminar on the theme of "Comedy Sadness" in Beijing, and three guests attended the event by Feng Xiaogang, Ning Hao and Dapeng.
The composition square alternates, and the director is the special feature of the willful "I am not Pan Jinlian", which is the alternation of the composition square, especially the circular picture taken with the masked lens is very fresh.
Feng Xiaogang explained: "This theme is very similar to Zhang Yimou's 'Qiu Ju's lawsuit', it is easy to think of a group, I think how to use the way we have not used to shoot. In fact, there is no special idea, is to feel fun, want to do something extraordinary."
Feng Xiaogang said that he regarded his work as a debut work, learned how to shoot circular pictures with the photographer, and even spent millions of dollars to let the photographer take a ten-minute test film.
Facebook will launch a fact-checking feature to combat fake news
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potentially hoax articles to third-party testing agencies and display the results below the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, Facebook said it would begin using an updated machine to learn to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact-checkers, and possibly display fact-checking results below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main spread points of so-called fake news, and many believe that Facebook influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters encountering a proliferation of false stories ahead of France’s presidential election in May, and Germany taking the lead in passing support for the fine plan ahead of the September elections, and being fined if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in time.
In a separate statement in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was launching a new fact-checking feature test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sarah Sue, product manager at Facebook News Feed, said in a blog post: “In addition to seeing stories being questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its “relevant articles” feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Graphic Novel: The Story of England Castle
More recently, the tiny Scottney Castle has been the protagonist in a compressed music video and once became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scottney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in his comfortable location in the Belle River Gorge in Kent, and it is now the inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a special love for historical documents and a mop.
“You can see the handwriting of the ancients 300 years ago, and I found it so beautiful,” he said.
"What kind of personal fate is this to let this letter fall into my hands."
Across the Middle Ages through the Edwardian era, the “One English Castle” reads, each of which is written by different, future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This isn’t the first book Rhodes uses archives as raw material: he also wrote The Teeth and Other Stories of the Dead in 2014, a book inspired by the archives of the British Library, a work he was accomplished by an uncontrollable creative passion.
“I could not suppress my writing impulses at the moment when I saw the thumb imprint on the side of the letter, written by a double agent working for Jacob in the 18th century,” he said.
That's his fingerprints!
And the letters have always smelled of smoke, because at that time, you need to light a fire to have light.
For us 300 years later, the smell makes people feel like they’re with us.
I like the archives!”
For those moved by the old paper, it seems fantastic to have the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and live in the castle for almost four months (to be honest, I stayed a little longer) and simply not believe it is true.
Rhodes spent several days visiting Victoria’s “new” castles, rummaging through archives, studying the estate’s many treasures and antiques, such as the hyena head hanging on the wall and the bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with the wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes the artists who illustrated his books.
Then in the evening, he would "drink some whiskey and write."
Scottney’s secret history is not yet clear, as the National Trust entered the United Kingdom only after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hessie, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began to process the archives, which he described as "hundreds of years ago the nobles are going away: 'Oh, put it in the attic'."
The diary, letters from the British Empire, depicts maps of the borders of various countries: "You would think land disputes would be boring," Rhodes said, "but two families will fight for a birch tree."
Let it go, guys!”
Some of the stories in the work use the castle as a starting point for a broader study of British history, including The Labourer, which is a reference to a man who left the newly built castle to take part in the peasant uprising of 1381.
“The story in the book, called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,” Roz says.
“The peasant uprising started in that area, and I think there was a good place to start the uprising.
Maybe there’s something related to these two?”
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, the story’s owner, the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is credited with holding his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a few years before his coffin exposed the ground, it was discovered).
The Darrells are Rhodes’ favorite of the Scottney Castle family: “These gentlemen seem scoundrel, constantly borrowing money and spending money on things they can’t afford.”
Generations of Darrell men solved their debt problems by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be a group of handsome young men who know how to pursue women."
As his mission in the castle comes to an end, Rhodes sets out to find other bizarre writing experiences.
In two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, he completed a drawing novel about “El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki,” an early 20th-century sanatorium that was slowly abandoned.
But Scotty has a special place for him.
“I’m sad to leave,” he said.
"It's like, 'Oh, I've got to face the real life of the trough.'"
According to the surging news reporter, ZTE's intelligent car team is headquartered in Zhuhai, and the operator is Tian Wenguo, executive vice president of ZTE.
Large energy companies are all rich and enemy countries, so who among the many energy companies in the world is the most expensive?
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy Company announced the 2011 ranking of the top 50 listed energy companies, US oil and gas producer ExxonMobil with a market value of $406.3 billion, followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
In the PFC list, PetroChina was twice in 2007 and 2009, and the top position in other years was held by Exxon Mobil.
In the 2011 Top 50 list, a total of three companies from mainland China were shortlisted, in addition to No. 2 PetroChina, which ranked No. 2 and China National Offshore Oil, No. 9 China Petrochemical, and No. 15.
According to PFC statistics, although the current oil price is much higher than four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy pointed out that there are many reasons for the low total market value, mainly including the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the low activity of global stock markets.
According to Xinhua News Agency, the heavy pollution weather in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas from the 16th was further intensified on the 19th, and the AQI of Hebei Shijiazhuang, Xinji and Handan 3 cities appeared "explosion table".
U.S. Changes to Green Card Regulations
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States will launch a new immigration plan and modify the green card regulations.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 per year, and temporary work visas and visa applications for families will be subject to stricter restrictions.
The new rules were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
U.S. media quoted Trump as saying, "This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and achieve these benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries."
The law will replace the current program and reduce chain migration.
This new application process is for applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills that are beneficial to economic development.”
On May 29, the first China Fireworks and Firecracker Safety and Environmental Protection Expo will be held in Liuyang.

Referring to the upcoming 2017 year, Zhao Lei said frankly: "After the tour next year, I want to clear myself, and then settle down and write more new works."
In order to optimize the scenic environment and build a beautiful southern Yue, recently, the "636" volunteer service team of the Southern Yue District Tobacco Bureau (branch) carried out the environmental protection activities of "climbing forest protection and home care".
The event not only received the support of all cadres and employees of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired old cadres and family members to participate in environmental protection practices, and the three generations of young and old people made concerted efforts to protect the forest, clean up the garbage, and dedicate their own strength to the construction of "Beautiful Nanyue".
This volunteer service activity aims to protect the scenic resources of Nanyue, carry forward the concept of "caring for others, caring for society, and caring for nature", and also allow the next generation to accept the cultivation from an early age and inherit the virtues of volunteer service.
It is reported that since the establishment of the "636" volunteer service team in early April this year, a total of 16 members have been developed, and a series of volunteer activities such as visiting disabled retail customers, helping tobacco farmers to care for tobacco, and Ya'an earthquake love donations have become a volunteer force that has been willing to transmit positive energy.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful.
Just when you think 2017 won’t be weird, the sex robot space has released a new technology development report.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) released a report that looks ahead to how sex robots will develop over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Schaki, a professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the robot’s eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
In a new report, Shaki said: "People are laughing behind their backs, but companies do launch a lot of sex robots, and we'll see more."
Modern sex dolls have evolved from sex dolls to robots, they have silicone skin, feel very warm, and deliberately use artificial intelligence to set up a human-like sexual response.
Users can also “customize” their robots to suit their preferences, from eye color and nipple shape to nail type or color.
But what’s even more disturbing is that many robots with “personality” can make “copying coves” look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
RealBotix robots, for example, can be defined based on features that users find attractive, such as shyness.
There is also the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, which can be pre-set personality characteristics, including the slightly shy "cold flala" and "happy to take risks" "Wild Wendy".
“Roxxxy Gold bots have the personality that matches you as much as possible,” True Companion said.
So she loves what you love and you hate.
She also had a little mood in those days like normal people!
She can be lazy, she can talk, she can be “sexually radiant.”
The rise of sex robots has brought a lot of unease — not just replacing real human relationships — but servile female traits and the rape twitching on the cold (interpreted as: resisting) Farah’s most worrisome.
True Companion compares Roxxxy to a man’s vibrating rod on its website.
The site says, “If women have vibrator sticks, then why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish, nor are they just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing maturity point to the darker, deeper parts of our culture: escaping from perfect gender equality to sex with surrender as an additional option.
Of course, most men do not have sex robots, and although FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more and more popular, they are still on the verge of consumer culture.
But what permeates from the edge allows us to see the course of our time.
Many people are not weird and unaggressive until the free market gives them the chance to become so.
It’s no coincidence that these fine sex robots are popping up in an era where women’s rights are threatened around the world, and the White House and a president who brags about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV series "The Handmaid's Tale" is not the realistic picture, not the hanging body, nor the eyes that are dug out, but the over-real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead was a jump, but now it didn’t seem far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create the most realistic female bodies (albeit in terms of porn stars) as much as possible.
The creators of these robots want them to have a human touch and imitate real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their “personality” does not represent real women.
They can’t break up or leave.
They have no recourse and no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking the illusion of complete slavery.
In other words, they are sex slaves.
Or according to the popular saying of 2017: maids.
"The Great Wall" tells the story of a Chinese elite unit fighting a life-and-death battle with monsters on the world-famous Great Wall to defend mankind in ancient times.
The last part of the fourth quarter of "Running, Brother" has been recorded, and Deng Chao, the captain of the "Running Men's Group", accepted the WeChat interview of the Shenyang Evening News and Shenyang Network reporters on May 30, from the "running man" in the "Study Doll" to the "funny villain" in the "scrapist angel", and then to the "debstinated man" Chen Mo, Deng Chao gives the impression of the audience as "the change of the star", constantly changing.
Deng Chao said, "In the performance, the same thing I will not do, to be constantly updated."
Trump's great achievements?
Mitt Romney is a microcosm of common sense.
Political divisions polarize American voters, and at the microcosm, undermine American family harmony. This is no wonder of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, major U.S. newspapers filled their commentary columns with fear of how to vote for Trump’s relatives.
It is generally assumed that we are doing everything we can to puncture our “filter foam.”
Less vocal is Trump’s strength to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, has long been at feud with the Republicans in our family, and he is coming to New York this week to visit me.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Because of her work with Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including even relatives of Republicans who have been in political bickering for decades, is now suddenly and strangely on the same front.
That's certainly a good thing if it's all at the dinner table. But I'm shocked that, from a broader perspective, it raises significant risks.
While left-wing figures have long been instigated by Trump, the taut effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we’re talking about the possibility that his eccentric behavior might one day stop.
Yet there is a more worrying long-term scenario in which Trump is “normalizing” his relationship with right-wing Republicans, who previously opposed Mr. President’s standards and now suddenly seem to be a symbol of reason.
I found myself recently to the Mitt Romney version of the wild eccentric somewhat nostalgia: putting the dog in the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), for the crimes of these two moves really seem too slight compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate will only need to sensibly qualify for incalculable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the carousel in New York Park, the largest carousel run by New York’s Central Park administration, and if you didn’t need coffee, the three-dollar ticket is the most valuable you’re in the city.
The sound of the trojan was as thunderous as the thunder, the central cylinder was designed for the fiberglass, and all the clowns and animals turned their heads, looking terrorically and sinisterly at their shoulders, while the tinkling music rang strangely.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: from the landscape overlooking the high-rise buildings to the old, the skyline becoming too familiar has not been able to provide much stimulation, and the reality of the city has not sustained the dream.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven’t completely forgotten that day, and I found that this “Swiss Cottage” is not actually a Swiss cottage, but a theme bar, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, which I can’t remember, but near an intersection in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a magical experience, with everyone having fun at an event that two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four girls in their 40s can all participate in.
If I could rate the carousel, I would give it a perfect score, but thankfully no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before swiping my credit card, I was asked to rate my trading “experience” by one to five stars.
The same is true of the coffee shop on my street corner, where you can also choose to rate with a 15% tip, which is to buy things over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the pace of what should have been a neutral trade, but also to put pressure on the waiter to add personal factors to unnecessary situations.
The poor woman in the department store smiled apologetically, and I was exhausted, and the credit card trading experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has left prison and transferred to the hospital.
He was taken to hospital last year for a wrist-cutting injury that the prison officials said was caused by a fall in his cell.
After prosecutors appealed the original manslaughter ruling, Pistorius was convicted of murder.
In the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013, he shot Steenkamp several times through the toilet compartment door in his home in Pretoria until his death.
Pistorius claimed to have mistook his girlfriend for an intruder hiding in the compartment at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year prison sentence for Pistorius, which they consider too benevolent.
The National Public Prosecutor’s Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If prosecutors win, Pistorius faces an increase in sentence to 15 years.
South Africa does not have the death penalty.

Two Bulgarians detained in Greece for illegal camping
According to the foreign ministry, two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, Sisonia police detained a group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians.
The detainees were released on the same day and the investigation is still ongoing.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Measures for the Management of Special Award for Structural Adjustment of Industrial Enterprises", which will arrange special award funds to promote the resolution of overcapacity in the coal and steel industries, with a total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, many local governments such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang have successively put forward reform opinions on resolving excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces have even proposed to actively seek financial support from the central government for the de-capacity of their provinces.
One proof is that only eight provinces announced coal-to-capacity targets stand at 90% of the national coal production reduction plan.
Lin Boqiang, dean of the China Energy Policy Research Institute at Xiamen University, said in an interview with reporters that it is not enough to rely on the central 100 billion yuan of "de-capacity" in the steel and coal industries, and more funds need to be solved by local governments and enterprises.
Shanxi Province recently announced the implementation of coal production capacity proposed to reorganize Shanxi Coking Coal Group into a state-owned capital investment company, the reorganization and integration of enterprises' assets and business, and build a new business model.
The actual funding gap may be three times that of subsidies, and Yin Weimin, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, said that the preliminary statistics of the "de-capacity" to be shunted and resettled by the employee coal system is 1.3 million people, and the steel system is 500,000.
Southern Daily News (Reporter/Xie Qingyu) The reporter learned from the Provincial Environmental Protection Department today that the results of the environmental protection credit rating of key pollution sources in Guangdong Province in 2012 are being publicized.
After evaluation, 134 of the 1251 enterprises included in the environmental credit management list were temporarily unrated due to shutdown, non-acceptance, shutdown and other reasons.
Among the red card companies to be evaluated, there are more heavy pollution enterprises such as electroplating, printing and dyeing, and prevention, and some sewage treatment plants are also on the list.
The Provincial Environmental Protection Department said that in order to reflect the principles of openness, fairness and fairness, and accept public supervision, the rating results are now publicized on the website of the Environmental Protection Agency.
During the publicity period, the Environmental Protection Department will receive calls from the public, letters, visits and other forms to reflect the problem, and the Environmental Protection Agency will investigate, verify and deal with the problems reflected.
Climate change could irrevocably destroy large numbers of species, including the resources and food on which humans depend.
Waynes said that even if the heat does not directly kill the species, it can create potential risk factors.
Waynes’s study also showed that local extinctions vary from region to region, with species in the tropics twice as likely to go extinct locally compared to temperate regions.

Does meat, dairy and chocolate help relieve inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: A diet rich in meat and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease patients.
The incurable disease has a life impact on about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, causing stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bleeding diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington often advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers have found that the protein’s key amino acid, tryptophan, helps promote immune cell growth, and these cells boost the tolerance of the gut.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explains that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food don’t crept into the body.
Maintain a balance between the inflammatory cells and those that enhance tolerance, protecting the body without damaging various sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
When the equilibrium state is too biased towards inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
In the experiment, it was found that an immune-boosting cell appeared in mice that carried special bacteria.
Bacteria need tryptophan, one of the components of the protein, to form the appearance of the cell.
Professor Colonna said: “We established a link between a bacterial population ( Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a normal part of the gut microbiota) and the development of a population that promotes tolerance.
The more tryptophan consumed in the diet, the more immune cells they had.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, i.e. a combination of Lactobacillus and tryptophan-rich diets, might form a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a postdoctoral researcher who studied a type of immune cell that enhances tolerance, did not find that one group of mice studied had such cells, but the same strain was raised separately.
She suspects that this difference is related to the gut microbiota (referring to the bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract) community.
DNA sequencing of the mice’s cholesterol found that six bacterial populations were present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
Rats are raised in a sterile environment, so they lack gut microbes and cannot develop such immune cells, and those with Lactobacillus pt. leptitius produce immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured Lactobacillus in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of the bacteria-free liquid to the immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cell develops into a cell with tolerance.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be shown that the active ingredient is a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, called indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the rat feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when the tryptophan level was halved, the number of cells was cut in half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people, like mice, have the same tolerance-enhancing cells, and most of us have Lactobacillus in our gastrointestinal tract.
Whether humans, like mice in experiments, can induce cell development of tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus in vitro bacteria in the body, is not known, but gene defects related to tryptophan have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
“The development of these cells may be exactly what we want, because these cells can control the inflammatory response on the inner surface of the gut,” she said.
It can be said that the high level of tryptophan present in Lactobacillus may lead to an increase in the number of strains.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a 'genius' Nemania Matic
On Wednesday night, after Nemanja Matic made his first match in Sampdoria, Mourinho identified United as signing a "genius" midfielder.
Matic, from Chelsea, signed up to £40m and opened 2-1 on Tuesday in the final pre-season game of the Europa League before Dublin against Real Madrid, winning the favour of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, during the Blues pre-season Asian Tour, Matic was in a serious shortage of playing, finishing only 45 minutes and Mourinho admitted that improvements were needed before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and the way of thinking – he thinks about football,” Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible."
Mourinho began arranging his starting line-up at the start of the season. Like Matic, new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started playing at Ingera Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wants to bring in three more signings, but insists the club is "doing a great job" and that he has four preferred signings in his heart and that the club has brought in three of them.
“The club brought in three of the players, and I am very grateful,” he added.
“I would be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they’ve worked hard for me.”
Will China fall behind if China does not build this type of warship?
With the recent world's major naval powers have announced the construction plan of the new frigate, as if overnight the frigate has become the focus of attention of the major powers of the navy, first of all Japan in the 2018 annual defense budget to determine the purchase of two new frigates, so that the Japanese DEX frigate plan finally has a substantial breakthrough, and then the United States Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest plan of the US FPG frigate plan, so where should China's new frigate go?
With the launch of a new 054A frigate at the end of 2017, marking that the 054A frigate has built up to 29 ships, has approached the sum of the 053H series frigates, and from the first 054A launched in 2006, the construction process of 054A has been 12 years, even in the world, the construction of so many high-performance general-purpose frigates, in addition to China, only the United States in the 7th and 80s of the last century built the "Perry" frigate can be compared.
The reason why so many 054As was built is simple: affordable, easy to use, and supplement the Navy owes for years.
054A frigate with high cost performance and good combat effectiveness for many years by the Chinese Navy's favor, its displacement of about 4000 tons, equipped with a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of sea red flag -16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile launch a common hair system, 8 eagle strikes 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006, the design time is very early a kind of ship, but its combat effectiveness even in today's is not too bad, looking at the world's frigates.
But after all, this is a type of ships designed in the early 21st century, the weapon configuration is set aside, its power system and electronic radar equipment compared with the current world's mainstream frigates already have a big gap, like Europe's same type of frigate has been equipped with full electric propulsion, small multi-functional phased array radar, large size helicopter deck, but also to develop a new model.
So how China's new frigate should be developed is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic direction of our navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will surely become a blue-water navy, and the future will also be to the ocean, with the rapid deployment of areas where China's vital interests are closely related, the display of force, and the ability to have a strong combat power to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged, so it seems that the new Hu Weijiang will move towards large-scale and oceanic development.
Looking at the positioning problem of the new frigate in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy, except for the necessary offshore defense ships, other main ships will form an aircraft carrier battle group or amphibious assault ship strike group according to the needs of the situation.
The role of the new frigate in the future aircraft carrier battle group should serve as anti-submarine main force and the positioning of the near-area clearance, in the amphibious assault ship strike group should serve as a escort ship class, then according to such demand, the new frigate must have a strong anti-submarine capability and a good medium-range area clearance capability.
Based on the above positioning, it is possible to boldly imagine the approximate appearance of domestic frigates in the future.
First of all, the displacement relative to the current 054A frigate will have a substantial increase, it is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons; the power system will use a QC280 improved gas turbine and two diesel engines composed of an integrated electric propulsion system, the maximum speed is expected to reach about 30 knots, the endurance will also be greatly increased; as for the weapon configuration 76 mm main gun and 1130 near-arm gun should be retained, but will add a red flag 10 launch system, the main gun should have a 32-48 rear.A large 8-16 unit vertical hair system should be installed for launching eagle strike 18 and new cruise missiles; the hangar and shutdown platform will also be increased to accommodate and store two 10-ton helicopters; as for electronic radar systems, high-end should be equipped with small four-sided fixed phased array radar based on the development of the 346A, and can use multi-functional rotating phased array radar similar to the European frigate.
In this way, the overall level of the new frigate will reach the current world-class level, even compared with the United States FFG.
Of course, the above concept is only the author's conjecture on the domestic new frigate, how we can only wait until the new frigate is launched to find out, let us look forward to it together.

In recent years, the city encourages enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national, industry standards and regional group standards, to the main or participate in the formulation of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards to give 300,000 yuan reward, through the Zhejiang manufacturing brand certification of enterprises reward 500,000 yuan, is the province's highest amount of the award, stimulate the enthusiasm of enterprises to participate in the benchmark.
A few days ago, Wangli Group production workshop, the head of the group system Gao Jian and employees are packing a box of anti-theft security doors, as a sample of participating in the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard to meet the standards, ready to be sent to Shaoxing quality testing center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li has passed the on-site audit of the "Zhejiang Manufacturing" certification expert group.
Gao Jian said that the professional team composed of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations praised the group's achievements in quality excellence, independent innovation and other core achievements, and agreed that it was completely in line with the standard, and then as long as the product passed the inspection, Wang Li would become one of the first enterprises to pass the standard.
Wang Li Group is only a microcosm of the standard to promote the transformation and upgrading of the industry.
Our city and its synchronous development of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards and standards work also Buyang, group group.
Since the formulation of the Zhejiang manufacturing team standard formulated by the anti-theft security gate industry in our city last year, enterprises such as the moon and new countries are also actively applying for docking standards work.

Is China's household debt ratio close to that of the United States, and what's more frightening than not being able to afford a home is that it can't pay off debt?
Recently, everyone is discussing what changes in real estate policy have recently changed, is the real estate policy loosened again?
However, when we are worried about real estate prices, worried about macroeconomic regulation and control, and worried about the future trend of the real estate market, the People's Daily once again wrote an article, the last time we specifically discussed the "People's Daily" comment on the adjustment of real estate regulation, and now the People's Daily article is a more serious topic than buying a house, is it even if you can afford to buy a house, you have to get a debt?
Today, we’re going to talk about a bigger problem than buying a house: paying off the loan.
China's Growing Housing Debt Crisis
According to the data in the article, in November 2017, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center released the "third quarter China deleveraging process report", which pointed out that the leverage ratio of the residential sector continued to rise from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, up 1.3 percentage points, and increased by 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The proportion of debt in the entire real economy of the residential sector has increased, and the leverage ratio has risen rapidly.
The study shows that the debt of Chinese households in financial institutions is mainly consumer loans, accounting for about two-thirds of the debt of residents, which is about twice that of operating loans.
Among them, in consumer loans, medium- and long-term loans, mainly housing loans, account for about 80%, but from the incremental point of view, short-term consumer loans grow faster and are higher than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China's household debt ratio only counts the total amount of credit that the family sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households have many private loans, including borrowing from relatives and friends, and there is a large-scale hidden debt.
According to statistics from the Suning Institute of Finance, the leverage ratio of Chinese residents was only 3% in 1996 and only 18% in 2008, but the leverage ratio of residents began to show rapid growth since 2008, doubling to 36.4% in just six years. By the third quarter of 2017, the leverage ratio of residents had reached 48.6%.
In May last year, HSBC released a survey of nearly 10,000 respondents across nine countries.
The report was conducted among “millennial” young people in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
According to the report, China's post-80s and post-90s youth homeownership rate is as high as 70%, far ahead of second-place Mexico (46%), and twice the level of the US indicator (35%).
These data tell us a very likely problem, that is, compared to the inability to buy a house, the largest potential "gray rhinoceros" in China at this stage is expected to be unable to repay the debt.
Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analyzed before, although we have been saying that Chinese house prices are higher, but compared to other countries in the world, China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high, so not so much the high house prices can not afford to buy a house, I am afraid now to ask a lot of friends is do you still have to get a loan?
We look at the world's real estate market, China's real estate market started late, in addition to what we said before Hainan, there has not been a major real estate crisis, but just ten years ago, the origin of the 2008 world financial tsunami is the real estate crisis in the United States.
The reason for the real estate crisis in the United States is attributed to two houses: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
At that time, in the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses to low-income people in the United States at that time in order to expand sales, and when the US economy was good, the real estate market was also booming, but the good news was not long, with the stagnation of growth in the US economy, causing the income of home buyers to decline, so a large number of household consumer spending began to decline.
However, the current situation in the United States at that time is part of the financial assets and real estate assets of American household assets, almost all of the low-income groups in the United States are real estate, and most of the assets of the top 20% of the high-income groups are financial assets, resulting in the higher the debt ratio of the poorer the real estate in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people are bought when the economy is better, so the money to pay the mortgage is also calculated in terms of their better income, when the income has declined, the pressure of mortgages not only did not reduce or even because some subprime mortgage plans have become floating, so the real estate problems of these American families have gradually evolved into real estate crisis.
So some people because the income is too low to pay the mortgage, so the bank began to recover the property, when the bank from the delinquent loan buyers to recover the property, they will be sold at a very low price, resulting in the region's house prices gradually decline, this process triggered a further decline in house prices, formed a vicious circle, when the house price fell to a certain extent, more and more buyers found that the value of their houses even lower than their own loans, so there are more people to stop repayment, and caused more bad debts.
Thus, a vicious circle is formed:
“The economy is sluggish – incomes are falling – some people can’t afford to pay off their mortgages – banks sell their homes at low prices – house prices are down – more people stop paying off their mortgages – banks are selling – house prices are falling...”
And the problem is not only so, because the price of the house continues to fall, we stop repaying the loan to the bank is not after you have no debt, if the bank auction house to get the money is not enough for you to owe the bank's loan, then you still need to pay back the money, simply say you use the down payment of 600,000, loan 2.4 million to buy a house worth 3 million at the time, when the house price fell to the house is only worth 2 million, you no longer repay the house to the bank, after the bank auction house, you not only lost your own down payment.
As a result, in this vicious circle, the US economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.
Therefore, at this stage, the level of China's household debt ratio reached a high of 46.8% is a very need to be vigilant about the problem, this data is still lower than the level of developed countries, but the early signs of the problem have begun to appear, the country has repeatedly emphasized the problem of deleveraging since last year, which is a very prescient judgment, if the household debt rate is allowed to continue to climb, it will inevitably lead to huge risks, so we must strictly prevent the emergence of financial risks.
Therefore, after the house is used to live, not for speculation, the state has accelerated the establishment of multi-subject supply, multi-channel security, rent-purchase and other measures to further resolve potential risks.
For our individual families, we must give up real estate speculative thinking, buy a house when we do our best, to avoid their families into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt level is a healthy family wealth development path.

British inventor implants chip in his body, waved his hand into the house and into the car
A British inventor installed a chip for himself, just waved his hand to open the front door of his home, enter the office and even start the car, becoming the first person in the country.
Steven Northam, 33, has a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, a service that his company BioTeq is enabled by technology.
He has teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, a senior consultant at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog chip implant and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company will also replace locks for rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, costing £300 per lock.
The married father, who has a child, has now installed the technology for his home and his BMW Z4, which he can start the car by putting his handle on the steering wheel.

White House tools cost thousands of dollars
According to military records released by Time magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, costing up to $24,000.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine One when the president rides) was an important exhibit at the White House on July 17 to highlight U.S. construction project activities.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufactured products from all 50 states.
Exhibits include a Connecticut-built helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the Marine Corps Helicopter First Flying Team (HMX-1), the White House Military Office requested that the helicopter appear on a daily order (FRAGO), that is, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn to participate in the "special" event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1 said in an email to the superior Marine Corps Deputy Flight Commander that “I just want to confirm that you are aware of this event, which is highly valued.”
This information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and will leave after the lawn is emptied from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the same day.
The information also said that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, a second crew would be required for the return flight because of the time limit on duty.
The original crew was on standby at the helicopter side during the event, while security forces personnel were on standby nearby when the aircraft was on the ground.
Time magazine’s records do not say whether a second crew will ultimately be needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
HMX-1 had asked if the event violated the Act.
The commander wrote, “One of the questions we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and was told there was no violation.”
“Sounds like you’re locked up,” the deputy commander replied.
The White House defines the “Made in America” campaign as an official event and is therefore not governed by the Hatch Act.
But even official events are political.
At the event, the president pushed the Senate’s agenda at the time: health care reform, and touted the regulation of government regulations.
Using Marine One or Air Force One aircraft for propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Presidents have been required to travel on these planes.
However, it is not common to expropriate it for photo purposes only.
Trump received attention in February, when the presidential plane slowly glided in Melbourne, Florida, and finally stopped at the background of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the former president's use of the presidential plane.
Lindsay Walters, the White House deputy press secretary, said: "The White House is thrilled by this 'Made in America' exhibition, which showcases products from all 50 states that are made from American workers using American materials."
The HMX-1 crew regularly conducts flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing the accurate placement of the president of the United States in the White House.
In early July, during Trump’s G-20 summit in Germany, the HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House.
One official said the U.S.-manufacturing flight was included in this month’s crew training requirements.
The helicopter unit also flew an additional 11 hours of “non-presidential support missions” that day.
The White House said the taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other items at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
The HMX-1 does not maintain a budget record for the president’s flight, so it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Department of Defense's hourly expenses for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense's reimbursement of the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The troop records record the aircraft’s time each flight from a base at Marine Corps airfield in Quantico, Virginia, for 30 minutes.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower.
Walters said, “Estimulating taxpayer expenses based on reimbursables is very misleading.
These estimates include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs, including annual appropriations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that Department of Defense reimbursement does not include personnel costs, but does include fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spiker defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to show something made in the United States this week.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they both contribute to our national security, and I suspect that hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on even if there aren’t.
And I think, like most Americans, we’re all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, a result of the hard work of countless Americans.
So it certainly is not inappropriate to show that.”
We don’t know if Trump interacted with the helicopter while touring the South Lawn at the event, but he did get in the driver’s seat of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives and joked with the media about the company’s plane, which he owned.
He said, "I know Sikorsky planes very well. I have three."
Xi Jinping's wonderful metaphor on comprehensively and strictly ruling the party
On January 11, at the second plenary meeting of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered an important speech, emphasizing that "with the persistence of always on the road, we will lead the party from strict to the in-depth and in-depth, and create a new situation of comprehensively and strictly ruling the party."
Regarding the comprehensive and strict governance of the party, General Secretary Xi Jinping has had a lot of image metaphors and reviewed it together!
"Tiger" to show off the face, "flies" fly to fly also to shoot. We must promote the comprehensive and strict management of the party to the grassroots, and strictly rectify the corruption that occurs around the masses.
—— On January 11, 2018, Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the second plenary meeting of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China.
The vast number of discipline inspection and supervision cadres should be loyal and firm, conscientious, law-abiding, integrity and integrity, and ensure that the power given by the party and the people is not abused and punished for the good.
—— On January 11, 2018, Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the second plenary meeting of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China.

The UK General Confederation of Trade Unions (GMB) is focusing on investment in the Glasgow plant of McVitie
The union wants the management of the biscuit manufacturer, McEather, to guarantee a long-term commitment to production at the Lasgo plant.
The Scotland chapter of the General Confederation of Trade Unions said the company had been silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross plant.
The plant employs more than 500 people and produces products such as hobnobs and rich tea.
Pladiss, owner of McVeques, said the company has invested more than £5m in the plant over the past few years.
He added that if there is a change in plant operations, employees and union representatives “will be the first to know.”
In a letter to the company's factory director, the Scotland chapter of the General Union of England called on McVitas to “address the problem of untending funds to modernize production lines”.
Drew Duffy, senior organiser of the General Confederation of Trade Unions, said: “We are not able to have a clear understanding of Tollcross’s future business needs and investment plans from the Managing Director of the plant, which is deeply worrying for our members.
Generations of families work here, and the high concentration of the labour force in the Greater Glasgow region is an important pillar of decent employment in areas with high unemployment and severe social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of employment, pay and economic prosperity, in the context of Brexit, rising cost of living and a long-term decline in manufacturing, the eastern part of Glasgow urgently needs McVeter to expand its production network.”
A spokesman for Pladis said: “The director of Tollcross received a letter from the Scotland chapter of the General Union of England yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we value ongoing contact with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we held regular meetings with employees and representatives of the General Union of England in Tollcross to discuss some issues publicly.
We had discussions with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and economically uncertain environment, we reviewed the ongoing operating model we applied to businesses and factories to stay competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million at the Tollcross plant, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross’s historic position as a production site, and employees and union representatives will be the first to know if there is any change in our operations at the plant.”

On May 10, environmental volunteers loaded classified waste into trucks.
In the past ten years, with the sharp increase of Everest mountaineering explorers and tourists, the environmental protection problems of the peak location have become increasingly prominent.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mountaineering Association launched the first cleaning campaign on the north slope of Mount Everest, cleaning up a batch of household garbage such as oxygen cylinders left over from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also specially broadcast at the World Climate Conference in Tokyo that year, which attracted the attention of the world.

When City expressed interest in signing Bryce Matedy in 2014, Nasser Al-Khereffi issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to sign the best player in Paris Saint-Germain.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we’re going to be against them and we’re going to contact their players as well,” Alkhleifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, they're going to have to do it themselves."
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club appeared to cross the line, with Barcelona throwing an olive branch to Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Villatti.
Paris Saint-Germain have made it clear they will not allow the Italian international to leave in any way, and Barcelona are likely to be affected by the loss of Neymar, the talent in the squad.
