A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in a local mall's stairwell.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, and said that everything was finally settled.
The San Francisco Coroner's Office said the body found Wednesday morning in the Westfield shopping center was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother Louis Galizh told KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a plumbing cook in Boston, had found an ideal job as a plumbing cook at Sons & Daughters in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters Restaurant said they were deeply shocked by Frank's death.
The spokesperson said,We are a small group of family members who live together like one, and we will miss him very much
In this sad moment, we express our deepest condolences and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially lived in the inn, but recently everything has finally improved.
Louis Galicia told KGO:Frank found an apartment while dating a girl.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother.
Frank has a kind heart and a broad heart.
Louis Galicia 称:Frank zh often has dinner for his family
He never wanted to fight with his family.
He was a man of opinion.
Louis Galicia says: "Everything in the world is possible, but Frank describes himself as a man of outward appearance who shines every day".
Anyone with leads can call the San Francisco Police Department and call 415-575-4444.
Strike of primary doctors: call for new labor action
The Union of Primary Doctors' Representatives has approved its new labor action to address new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association's Primary Doctors' Committee will ask all its members to start supporting more labour movements from the beginning of September.
The Primary Medical Committee said the ministers had not addressed concerns about the contract.
Primary doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott the contract deal with the British Medical Association.
zh of the members who voted, 58% were against the contract transaction.
Ellen McCourt, chair of the Primary Medical Committee, said in a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday night that the government had always been silent about the issue of contract boycott.
She said:In light of this, the Executive Committee of the Primary Physicians' Committee has voted unanimously to reject the proposed new contract and called for a formal consultation on all concerns to resumezh.
In response to the government's silence, the Executive Committee of the Primary Doctors' Committee has today formally requested the British Medical Association Council to convene a special meeting to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour action starting in early September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by primary care doctors this year, including the first full-scale strike in the history of the UK's national healthcare system.
Dr Johann Malawanazh, the leader of the British Medical Association's primary physician, resigned after a contractual agreement proposed by the British Medical Association was voted against.
At a meeting before the vote of 54,000 primary doctors and medical students, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be mandatory for healthcare workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: 格格 not to join the alliancezh?
One gesture ends a crisis.
Russia and the Turkish leaders met on Tuesday, where they shook hands and formally announced the end of an eight-month-long water war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met the Turkish president in the Golden Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had a strong feeling: this reconciliation was what Ankara most wanted to see.
Yes, both sides did shake hands.
However, even by Mr. Putin's unambiguous standards, Putin is only shallow and shallow, with little to show affection.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reportedly mentioned his good friend Putin five times.
I don't remember exactly.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, even higher.
The next day, a newspaper in the meantime wrote, Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
However, I think his enthusiasm implied something quite opposite.
However, Mr. Putin's continued cold-hearted attitude indicates that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in the opening credits was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was very strong.
Mr. Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of plotting Moscow.
Attacks from so-called friends make it even more difficult to accept.
It is difficult, even impossible, for both sides to re-establish true trust.
Since November, Russian public opinion has also been reversed.
For months, government-controlled media have carried out a shocking full-scale attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
The most serious of these was the accusations from senior officials: Mr. Erdogan's family profited from illegal oil trade in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He certainly denied that claim.
However, the news from St. Petersburg suggests that it is time to look ahead.
After all, the premise of this meeting was that Putin had received an apology from Turkish President Erdogan.
Russia can now declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are obvious.
First, Erdogan was in danger of being ousted after the failed coup last month, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The relentless terrorist attacks have obviously caused him a huge blow.
At the same time, there are also economic incentives.
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard, especially banning the airline services that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
This figure has dropped sharply by almost 90%.
With the resumption of flights, Russian travel agencies and airlines will be relieved.
They will be the catalyst for the Mediterranean tourism boom at the end of the season.
State TV even predicted this week that once Turkish agricultural imports reopened, the prices of fruits and vegetables would fall.
A report in the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti reported: "The tourists are gone, the tomatoes are back".
For Moscow, this visit also has additional political value.
Ankara is angry at the Western world's weak reaction to the takeover.
Moreover, Ankara is dissatisfied with the slow progress in joining the EU negotiations and with Putin's long-term interference, Putin is keen to take advantage of the political cold and to weaken Turkey's relations with the Western world.
Because of the support of elected authorities after the failed coup, the Russian leadership will surely receive Ankara's share.
Note, this is a gift to Moscow, which has always had a deep-seated fear of regime change.
Thus, the meeting in this golden seaside palace made Russia and Turkey allies of two countries rejected and abused by the Western world, one analyst describing it as non-aligned.
However, despite the public settlement, there are still significant differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors in Moscow's recent role in Syria, while Russia and Turkey support opposing factions.
As can be predicted, after nearly three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at the conference that they had not yet discussed the topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoids the issue of differences between the two sides, while Putin emphasizes the issue.
Both sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to reach a consensus on the Syrian issue.
With the possibility of months of public hostility and major catastrophes caused by the Russian aircraft being shot down by Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the leaders of both countries are sure to restart the dialogue once again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
According to the CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be simplified into a logistics department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwen told the BBC's Scottish branch that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand had once been committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, when it was about to go bankrupt, having to accept rescue, he has since given up pursuing it.
During that time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sporting events in ways such as the Rugby Six Nations and Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right approach is to show more national brands the lead.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will use it for Scottish customers, but not as a replacement.
In England and Wales, all the notes outside the headquarters and the securities exchange will be changed to the National West Bengal Bank.
The Alzh Ulster Bank brand has been used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland region.
There are also a few other more prominent smaller private bank brands, such as Chuzhbank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwen was interviewed during a visit by clients and employees of Inverness County.
He told the BBC's Scotland branch: "The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand, as well as one of the employee-employed brands, because in a larger sense we are now a bank with many brands".
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBSzh also became a global brand.
For now, I want to say that we no longer focus on the global, but on the domestic market.
Each brand represents a different industry in its own right, and our employees serve customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will no longer sponsor the Six Nations Championship; at the same time, it has worked to raise the profile of different brands sponsoring sporting events.
The CEO said: "It's time to become a multi-brand bank, because privately we've been exploring how to become a better customer service bank".
If we were to become a large bank with many brands three years ago, we would be ridiculed.
We are currently focusing on customer needs, and I am sure you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and now is the right time.
With Predilection, Daituri achieved a career-high 3,000 wins at Newmarket with his success.
Newmarket's two wins helped Daituri achieve a career-high 3,000 wins, after which he threw a sparkling celebration.
On Friday, professional rider Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th race win at Newmarket.
He devised the Predilection on horseback, a practice by John Gosden, and won two races that night, also achieving a career-high 3,000 wins.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional rider to achieve this milestone in the field of flat-topped racing.
The top five finishers were: Gordon Richards, the jazz, Doug Smith, Bergh (Lester Piggott), Pat Eddery, and Carson.
Daituri, a three-time champion rider who had won the Ghayyarzh earlier, said: "It's very special.
I'm excited because my family is also present.
I am happy with the results I have achieved at Newmarket, because 30 years ago I started here.
This is not a large-scale race, nor is it Royal Ascot, it is just a regular Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am happy, but also humble.
After the victory, Daituri came to Predilection, which caused a stir.
In the field of obstacle racing, two riders have achieved this feat, the champion rider Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, of whom Sir McCoy has won over 4,300 races in his record-breaking career.
Berzsche is a nine-time German champion, having won a total of 4,493 games in his career.
Daituri is one of the greatest riders of his time, so it is no wonder that he achieved this milestone, as few people have achieved this before him.
He was fashionable and fit, but what really made him stand out in the weight room was his tactical logic.
He was an amazing ambassador for horse racing, and over the years, his passion and charm for the sport has attracted a huge fan base.
A few weeks ago, I was at Epsom with Dairy Turtle, and I said that if he hadn't just had a weekend with the racing driver, he should have won 6,000 races already!
To be honest, it is very important that Daiturizh is considered the best British horse racing winner in three decades.
His character is lively, which is good for British racehorses, but besides that, he is also an incredible rider.
Daituri celebrated this milestone with his iconic jump-and-drop marathon.
From the jump line to the jump horse, for twenty years, Daituri has been a typical representative of the British flat racing scene.
His career was as a mountain biker as a general.
He won several races, including the famous 1996 Royal Scottish Rally Championship, but also suffered a crash and was banned from racing for taking a banned substance.
Three years ago, when he returned to the field after a six-month ban, he was once very hard-working. However, he showed remarkable personality strength and finally returned to the top, becoming a force for those who doubted him.
He may not be able to do it for too long, as he had said before, hoping to compete at least until he was 50.
Russian President Putin has removed Sergey Ivanov from his post as Director of the Office of the President.
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly removed Sergey Ivanov from his post as director of the presidential office.
Over the years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of the core group that Mr. Putin deeply trusts.
Ivanov, now 63, has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr. Putin had announced the removal of Ivanov from the post of Director of the Office of the Russian President, but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, who began as Mr. Ivanov's deputy in 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Mr. Waino, now 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government employees, the Kremlin website says.
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin: Thank you for your trust.
I think the most important task of this government is to support the heads of state in drafting laws and implementing control orders.
Mr. Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked to resign and recommended Mr. Waino to take over.
Is such a smile convincing?
Moscow is not comfortable with this move.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides, and like Putin, he also worked for the Soviet Security Agency in the Krebs.
As the office manager, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, both men said that the director of the office had asked for his resignation.
Despite the smile on his face in front of the camera, almost no one convinced him, especially in this period before the parliamentary elections.
So, did this result in a defeat in some kind of power struggle?
There is still no way to know.
However, the official statement that an elected official who was once considered a presidential candidate suddenly chose to dominate Russia's environmental policy has raised many doubts.
The Kremlin website quotes Mr. Ivanov's conversation with Mr. Putin, saying, "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you in one of the conversations to grant me this difficult, even troublesome, position for a four-year term".
"The result is that I have been the Director of the Office of the President for four years and eight months".
Mr. Ivanov took up this post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council, like Mr. Putin, and a former member of the National Security Agency.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin became the director of the Federal Security Service, Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
After Mr. Putin took office, he again named Mr. Ivanzhnov as one of his five most trusted people.
The outside world once considered that Mr. Ivanzhnov might be elected President of Russia after the end of Mr. Putin's second term, since three reelections were unconstitutional.
But the position eventually fell to another close aide of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin served as the Russian prime minister for a time before being re-elected president three and a half years later.
The mysterious fish surprised Banff, a garden.
A resident of Banzhff discovered fish coming from his garden and then sent for help.
Kevin Bain thinks these 75 fish may have been washed by the sea's tornadoes.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the ocean, posted a video of this strange scene on his Periscope, hoping someone would explain to him why these two-inch-long fish would appear.
The Queensferry Bridge now leads to Fazhf.
The project, which will cost £1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern side of the Queensferry Crossing with the high-rise bridge, meaning the bridge now runs to Faff.
The three bridges near each bridge are now close to completion, and the project will be the first bridge in the complex.
This section of the bridge, which begins at Fav, is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 hectares.
It used 10,000 hectares of steel, 20,000 hectares of concrete and 46 slopes of slate.
The project, which will cost £1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
 Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today, becoming one of the first people to climb the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic moment in the construction of the Kunzferzh Bridge".
We have all witnessed engineering work on such a grand project, and this section of the bridge alone used over 30,000 hectares of concrete and steel.
Although the size and weight of the bridge is enormous, the completion of the junction between the high-rise bridge and the bridge surface requires precise work, requiring very precise assembly.
In total, almost 79% of the total bridge surface has been installed, the last concrete bridge section is now in Rosyth, meaning that all the bridge surfaces are ready for use.
Michael Martin, project manager at Queens Ferry Bridge Construction Company, said: "Whatever the bridge project, the first bridge is a major milestone".
As for the remarkable project, this event showcased the cutting edge of civil engineering technology.
After installing the last section of the road panel and connecting it to the expanded Northbridge Road panel, the next step is to complete the remaining gaps on the north side or near the land side.
To complete this task, the northern suspension bridge would have to be moved 700 mm south.
This is a massive task, but also a very precise task.
It is said to be of enormous size, because the 222 m long, 6,000 hectares long, high-arch bridge requires a slope of about 3% to be pulled out.
Say it accurately, because the engineering team needs to ensure that the deviation is very small, only a few millimeters on each side.
The joy is that everything is going well.
Simone Biles has picked up the women's gymnastics all-around champion.
Forget about the pressure.
I forgot about the work.
Simone Biles is not affected by all this.
When you jump, you are full of energy.
The balance of the wood is a sword of the sword.
The free-form gymnastics movement is amazing.
The overall performance was very good.
Now, you've finally become an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the all-around title on Thursday, fully demonstrating her talent at the Olympic Games to lead the world in gymnastics.
She was the longest-serving super-silver medalist in the Final Five with a total of 62,198 points, along with team member Aly Raisman and bronze medalist Russian athlete Alya Mustafina.
Simone-Beyles, from the United States, performed a balance-wood performance on Thursday in the final of the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Byers helped Team USA win four straight Olympic women's individual all-around titles, and she won five medals at the Olympics, further proving that she was the best gymnast of her generation, and perhaps the best ever.
When she saw her score, Bayles couldn't stand the flow of water.
Byers thus joined the ranks of athletes who, like Michael Phelps, met for decades, and they took their sporting programs to new heights:
For the past three years, Bayles has been calling the field "the arena", winning a total of 15 world championship medals, including ten golds. She has been determined to train every day to achieve greater accuracy. 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said: "Bayles is the greatest gymnast I have ever seen".
Brazil still has a final match, but this match is not a competition between Bayles and other gymnasts, but rather a fight between herself and the enormous pressure of expectations.
If the Bayles didn't return to her home in Spring, Texas, with a gold medal, everyone would be very disappointed.
Simon Byrnes from the United States (left) and Lesman hugged each other, and they won gold and silver medals respectively in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byers won their first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a surprise tribute to retired national team coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Bayles insists that he has no plans for the future during his tenure as the champion, the reality is not quite the same.
One of the episodes of Bairros's free gymnastics included her iconic turn of the century, accompanied by Latin music, which she often heard in a one-street neighborhood of the Rio Olympic Stadium.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a baby and discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman during a field trip to the gym, has now grown into a force to be reckoned with.
Since the summer of 2013, Bayles hasn't lost a game in an all-around game, and if she wants to win, she will win.
Mustafina's slightly ahead after two turns was just an illusion.
Bayers, the defending world champion in both the wood and freestyle events, is set to take the bait.
Her balance of wood scores were 15.433, free gym scores were 15.933 
While waiting for the final score, Lesman gently hugged the Bears. When the Bears learned that they had achieved their dream, they immediately closed their eyes.
Leszman's performance was a bit like revenge for four years ago, when she was tied for third, but lost to Mustafina in the final.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, who was nicknamed "Grandma" by Americans, was far ahead.
She kissed the crowd after finishing her free gym, announcing her return, but before such a return there sometimes seemed to be doubts.
Byles is only 19 years old.Since earlier this week, his news has been viral on Twitter.For Byles, his life has been given a whole new meaning.
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was shot dead, survived the Philadelphia shooting.
A six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old to be shot in the city this week, police said.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child shot was Mahaj Brownzh.
Brown's abdomen, legs, and abdomen were heavily gunned down, but the child was clear on the way to the hospital, they said.
"He was convicted of a number of crimes, his tiny body was hit by a bullet and his grandmother Delores Melendez told the television station.
I just couldn't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
His family told the TV station that the child hopes to recover.
He was about to start his first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two of the three other victims of the shooting were aged 29, and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, the condition of one of the victims, a 29-year-old, is critical; the condition of the other two victims is stable.
According to the TV station, the child and the 29-year-old victim, who were in critical condition, were found in the front seat of the car.
Two other victims were not in the vehicle, and police are investigating whether gunmen were among the wounded.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunmen had been shooting at each other.
Numerous explosive weapons were found at the scene, so it can be concluded that they were using different weapons.
From this judgment, it is undoubtedly an ongoing battle.
There were explosions on the sidewalks on both sides of the street.
"So, as can be seen from this, there were several armed men at the scene in a state of extremist strife at the time", Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
Several homes and vehicles were damaged in the area.
An arrest warrant has not yet been issued, police are said to be watching surveillance footage.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old girl, who was playing at the front door of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood, was shot in the head.
She is currently recovering, and police are still hunting down the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie?
That's how I assess this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I've been to every Summer Olympics, but the United States has never held such a dominant position.
Second, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts Simon Byles (Simone Biles), Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have been inspiring many girls of color.
The composition of this group makes everyone proud, as it includes Jewish Ally Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian.
This team finally looks like the American team.
It also cemented the top position of black and Latino women in the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been non-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabriela finished first and second respectively.
That's too much of a shock.
At the last Olympics, Gabriel Douglas unexpectedly became Olympic champion, which made the United States cheerful.
Today, the world can see the incredible excellence of three-time world champions Simon Byrnes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have mastered the divine incarnation by practicing conventional gymnastics skills.
On Thursday, Simone helped Team USA achieve four straight titles in the women's individual all-around program.
Her teammate Ali Lizmann won the silver medal.
We have reached the pinnacle of the sport, but not in the gym classroom.
Simon Gabriel and Laurie have made the Olympic team the same way Ali and Madison did.
They are the Final Five, as the next Olympic gymnastics team will be made up of four gymnasts, coached by Marta Karolyi in her final year.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport, gymnasts train mainly in private gym clubs, their parents pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel fees (including coaching and related expenses for gymnasts and families), and the list of expenses is growing.
Most gym clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can provide support for the industry.
All gymnasts' training is completed at these clubs, a costly and expensive expense for the gymnasts' families in the long run.
The Baylor coach Amy Boorman and the Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have coached the two gymnasts since they began practicing.
We must bring more affordable, more affordable gymnastics training to countless young girls who have been deeply influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I founded my own gym foundation.
In my organization, we provide free, inexpensive gymnastics to young people in over 15,000 urban areas in black neighborhoods (mostly black and Hispanic) and have cultivated national and even world championships.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my home city, to provide high-quality gymnastics to those who deserve this opportunity to learn and to provide young people who benefit from this amazing Olympic Games with high-quality gymnastics.
Physical exercise helps to develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, and also helps to develop a hardworking spirit, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring a lifelong benefit to a person's health, academic and professional success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Sports participation is important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
I thank Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabriela and Madison for the girl's power that was so well demonstrated in winning the Olympic gold medal group, and I thank them for inspiring young girls from so many backgrounds to open up the path to health, strength and success.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, the primary care physician plans to strike further.
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute over the change by accepting a contract with the British Medical Association (BMA) officials to amend the contract, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 primary doctors who voted against the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunter revealed plans to force the contract, saying that the UK's NHS is currently in a "vacuum zone", and that a slight delay would be detrimental to the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first mentioned modifying the practice of working overnight and on weekends for primary care physicians to improve the care of abnormal working hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Primary Medical Committee, said in a statement last night: "Primary doctors remain deeply concerned about the proposed contract, particularly that it will exacerbate the current labor crisis, and that it will not treat all doctors fairly".
There are only eight weeks left until the first doctors sign a new contract, and we need to make progress, not much time left.
The BMA strives to resolve disputes through negotiations, but people are reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government responds in silence.
Nevertheless, just last month we got the promise of Jeremy Hunter, who said his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt now needs to act, abolish enforcement, and address the concerns of primary care physicians.
If he fails to do so, the primary care physician makes it clear that they are ready to take further labor action.
The last strike took place in late April, resulting in nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 cases delayed due to nurses and emergency medical technicians covering up for doctors on the interim line.
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute over the change by accepting a modified BMA contract.
The BMA hopes to secure better weekend wages for the 54,000 primary care physicians covered by the contract.
NHS Employers  CEO Daniel Mortimer  called on primary care physicians not to strike again 
Mr Mortimer said: "While labor moves have little effect, they put pressure on the already dedicated teams and services, causing anxiety, anxiety and confusion for patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have been in continuous negotiations with the Primary Physicians' Commission, and together with the Department of Health and other departments, have been actively responding to their concerns about the role of caregivers and the reporting of reports.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics such as deployment, flexibility in training, other training for those who have returned after a career break, training costs, shared awareness of the curriculum outline, improvement and gender pay gaps in the medical field, which illustrate the importance of the agreements between the employer, Health Education England and the Department of Health and the BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds of medication a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
 Officials suggested that a £2 a day drug be promoted to more patients and that the duration of the drug be extended, after which thousands of heart patients would benefit from this drug.
Antiglycemic agents in place of tickgrelor can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
This medication is taken for 12 months after a heart attack, and can reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE), the regulatory body under the NHS in the UK, recommends that patients continue taking the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, the NHS regulatory agency NICE recommends that patients continue to take the drug for four years, in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, and a quarter of them will continue to experience a recurrence of heart disease or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances that build up plaques in the arterial walls.
If the plaque ruptures, it causes a blood clot, thereby blocking blood flow to the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the blood clot moves, it enters the bloodstream, blocking blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
zh patients who have had a heart attack once have a higher risk of having a heart attack again.
The Cagre, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed as Brillique, can reduce the risk of disease by reducing the formation of blood clots.
A draft NICE guideline published today recommends that patients take 90 mg of anti-caragree for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of anti-caragree daily and two doses of aspirin for the next three years.
Prof Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the effective use of secondary preventive therapy, up to one-quarter of patients with a history of heart attack will have a second stroke or stroke, usually with serious consequences".
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking Cagregre with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of heart disease recurrence and stroke in patients who have had a heart attack.
Cagre's temporary recommendation for the treatment of cancer will provide thousands of beneficiaries with more treatment options, and we are very pleased about this.
Because there is limited information about the efficacy and safety of anti-carrageenan after three years, especially the risk of bleeding, the draft guideline does not recommend continuing treatment after this time limit.
Computer culture has made electoral fraud prevalent in Muslim areas.
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was ousted last year by corruption, prompting a government report to be published.
Political correctness and culture have made the widespread election fraud that is prevalent in the Muslim community overlooked, a deadly government report today reveals.
Former interior minister Sir Eric Pickles has accused the police, election regulators and the city hall of over-sensitizing racial and religious issues and ignoring evidence of electoral abuse.
The former minister of community affairs, who is now an anti-corruption figure, said that the practice of using religious positions to intimidate voters would have a negative impact on the police, and that the police should be allowed to set up a line of vigil outside the polling station to protect the fearful voters.
He suggested that voters carry their ID card when voting to prove their identity.
Currently, voters are only required to state their name and address.
The report even recommended that indelible ink be applied to the voter's fingers to prevent a second vote.
Sir Eric said that the protection of whistleblowers should be increased.
He called for more media understanding of the conference documents and the way in which decisions are made by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local governments from the toxic effects of a widespread corruption culture and financial fraud closely linked to it", he said.
This report was released at the request of Downing Street following the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that a series of corruption and lawless acts had been committed by the then mayor of Lahman, and that he should be removed from office.
The court found that Rahman had ridiculed the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and had not yet made a statement about his accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahmanzh during the campaign allegedly declared that voting for him was a religious obligation for loyal Muslims.
Up to 300 ballots are in doubt, possibly voters faking others' votes.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
He specifically warned of mail fraud, allegedly by senior members of the Muslim community who pressured voters to vote for their nominated candidates.
Sir Eric (pictured) has made several suggestions on clearing the voting mechanism, including bringing a valid ID card to prove his identity.
He said in the report: "Evidence shows that senior members, particularly senior members of Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds, have put pressure on some vulnerable groups in minority communities, especially women and young people, to let them vote as they please.
 Because of their over-sensitivity to racial and religious discrimination and political correctness, they fear that state institutions will ignore such behavior
Sir Eric has proposed 50 electoral clearance mechanisms, including a ban on political activists handling mail ballot papers to prevent polling.
The report also called for strict scrutiny of registration information to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and welfare fraud.Theresa May is also considering the report.
These recommendations include requiring voters to present their identity documents before voting.
zh after voting, unerring ink is applied to the voter's fingers to prevent a second vote.
The ethnicity of the voters is systematically verified to ensure their voting rights.
The validity of the automatic mail vote request will be limited to three years.
It is forbidden for political activists and activists to process completed postal ballots and postal ballot envelopes.
Authorizing the police to set up a vigil around the polling station.
 amending the legal provisions, so that it can be easier to comply with the Representation of the People Act 1983 to prosecute persons concerned for intimidation.
The law says it is illegal to take pictures at the polling station.
 Provisions that English language is used only in the polling stations except in Wales) 
 Strengthen training, ensure staff strictly follow the rules that electors go to the polls separatelyzh
Sir Eric has been critical of the Metropolitan Police, saying that they have not brought any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets incident, a surprising finding.
Rahman and his election agents were often corrupt and illegal, and were therefore disqualified by the electoral court, he said.
According to the standard of criminal evidence, he is unquestionably guilty in many respects.
He also criticized the fact that the municipal election registration department checked the form and the virtual box of choices.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's judgment of the court against Tower Hamlets sounded the alarm.
Our country has an honorable tradition of parliamentary motherhood, but the secret manipulation of election fraud and the subsequent widespread disregard for its reality by some institutions also threatens this good reputation.
Cyclists who looked like Queen Kate at the Rio Olympics and other celebrities who bumped into the face were in demand.
This week, French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who looks like Queen Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was highly sought after by audiences.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is not the only gold medalist to face the famous celebrities at the Summer Olympics, at least social media doesn't think so.
Therefore, in memory of the Rio Olympics and all the faces of celebrities who appeared on screen at the time, FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympic athletes who had hit the face of Hollywood stars.
Hunters and Wolves: American men's rowing team member Brady Ellison (Bradie Ellison) was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio from a young age.
In addition to the player who bumped into Kate's face on a bike track, many netizens soon discovered that a sniper was Leonardo DiCaprio's half-brother.
Since his image of the Wolf of Wall Street starring role was revealed on Twitter, U.S. men's rocket team member Brady Ellison caused a huge stir on social media.
In fact, the rocket shooter noticed the social media hype and admitted that when he was a little boy, someone said he looked like Little Li.
I don't think he looks very much like anything other than the net, Brady told the Huffington Post.
He's a good-looking, hot-tempered son of a bitch, so I guess that's a compliment to me.
One of the most popular rivalries at the 2012 London Olympics will undoubtedly be found this year with more similarities: British long jumper Greg Rutherford looks like the famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.

 propagation theory: According to this user, this pair appears to have a cause.
A Twitter user recently happily stated online that other netizens also think Hop Solo and Jennifer Carter actually look the same.
Indeed, the American football star and the bloodthirsty pharmacist have a very similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Carrie Walsh Jennings, whose smile is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney; and gold-medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful and glamorous smile and the smile of Gabrielle Union, who is also a star of the Brought It On star.
CBC Olympic analysts apologized for comments made by Chinese swimmers who were as slow as pigs.
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comments about 14-year-old General Ayrawi, who won fourth place in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay, angered viewers watching the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) live broadcast of the Olympics.
A Canadian broadcaster CBC commentator said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer would swim faster than the airflow at the start of the race, but eventually slow as a pig, after which CBC was forced to apologize for this.
Commentator Byron MacDonald, at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, expressed some of his views, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
Speaking to the audience after hearing the CBC comment team, Byron, a colorful eyewear commentator, said: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake".
Because it was too excited, it swam faster than the smell of air when it started to leave, but later it was as slow as a pig.
And it's really thanks to her.
Chinese swimmer Aifei-sheng, now 14, is the second-best, with a time of 1:57.79 seconds and a 1.61 second behind Canadian Taylor Ruck, which has led the Canadian team to narrow the gap with China.
The whole Canadian audience was amazed by the speaker's tone and wording, and they quickly reacted online.
Emmett Macfarlane 推送道: The CBC commentator said that the Chinese 14-year-old swimmer was as slow as a pig???
This idiot didn't realize that it was live.
Chinese junior general Aifei, who competed in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final, is described as follows: "That 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake".
Criticism of Biden's tweet quickly hit the Twitter booth, with many demanding his withdrawal from comment.
When Twitter users heard that Byron MacDonald was slow to respond to this, they didn't stop.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "#Byron McDonnell has been a huge influence on me.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words make us all sound like a bunch of racists.
Shortly afterwards, CBC broadcaster Scott Russell apologized for Byron's remarks on the live broadcast, saying: "We apologise for the comments made on the live swimmer's performance".
 We are sorry for the occurrence of such an inappropriate wording
CBC has apologized more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the comments.
Another commentator, Scott Russell, also apologized on behalf of Byron.
CBC then posted a copy of their apology to over 90 other Twitter users protesting Byron's comments.
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We apologize for saying such things and for putting it on the air.
Last night, we took swift action, apologizing to our viewers who watched our live broadcast and who were paying attention to our viewers on social media.
It is worth noting that Byron's explanation is directed at the performance of the swimmer, but not at her personal level.
That is, the wording is indeed inappropriate, and Byron is deeply sorry for this.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized in a live broadcast, saying his words were not meant to be half-human attacks, and attempted to use them to disarm himself from his own speech.
I wanted to take some time to apologize for my remarks last night after the women's relay, as he said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
I am merely commenting on the performance of a swimmer, not on his individual performance.
Of course, I didn't mean to disrespect you, I'm sorry.
Primark customers expressed anger at a woman who shamelessly tried to break into a store in the center.
A woman was in a strip club in the center of a Primark store, where shoppers were unsure where to look.
Worse, she also weighed how she looked after wearing it, then took off her underwear and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves, and eventually tried four of them in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestonezh.
The woman kept trying to insert the inside of the Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, then dropped it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, also in the store at the time, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman dressed again, then walked out of the store, buying nothing.
She said: "Everyone dares not believe what they see.
She stood in the middle of the store, took off a shelf underwear, undressed her tight pants and underwear, and dressed like this.
She didn't try to find a hiding place to try to get through, she just stood there, really proud.
When she took off her clothes again, everyone was shocked and stunned. Obviously, she was still unhappy because she put the clothes back on the shelf.
Then, she tried three more like this, and found out that none of them were her favorite, and then dressed again, went out of the store and went to the store.
She didn't seem to care that anyone was watching her or who would eventually buy her way through the tunnel.
Ms Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: "It is disgusting to think that someone will buy a toilet that has been passed by others and not cleaned.
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs Davidson added: "After she leaves, the shopkeeper obviously has to do the shelf work on these cases, thankfully so".
I hated buying a new wardrobe, but found out that another woman had tried to go through it and hadn't been cleaned.
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark has already learned what happened inside our Folkestone store.
All the products with problems have been discarded.
 how to use horse magic to protect yourself in a gun attack 
This world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you a little bit of security.
We are going to the Krav Maga Federation in New York, where we are going to talk to Master Rhon Mizrachi, who is a teacher, to learn how to approach gun-toting offenders from close range.
Whether he's coming in from the front or behind you, this video will teach you how to win and lose.
Mizrachi said, if the gunman approaches you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and clear the line of fire.
Then, with your forearm and shoulder, hold the gun, and then hit the attacker's face with your elbow.
Then, with the knee above his belly, he lowered his body as the attacker fell from his pain, turned the gun in his hand, hit him in the face with a rifle and a backup rifle, keeping the weapon pointed at him.
If the gunman approaches from the front, similar techniques are used to keep your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist the gun hook so that the gunman cannot fire.
At the same time, pressing the weight on the gun and hitting the attacker's chest, and turning the gun from his tight hand, then aiming the gun at him.
zh sounds complicated?
Watch the video, see what Mizrachi actually does.
But remember, if you're not a master of horse-racing, if you want to get away from robbery, the safest way is to turn up gold.
A family of refugees destroyed a cheap rental house in Soltaszh, Cornwall, before they were expelled.
A family of strangers who were evicted for intimidating neighbors, destroyed their cheap rental property before leaving, causing £50,000 in damages.
After a series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilzhcock were evicted from their cheap rented house in Soltasch, Cornwall.
After being forced to leave the residence, Housing Association officials were surprised to find that it had been severely damaged.
The walls are all holes, the floors are broken, the garbage is all over the place, the walls are painted with rubbish.
The family has been moving since their expulsion, and is said to be living in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, Housing Manager at the Cornwall Housing Association, said she was concerned that the house could no longer be saved.
She said: "For the people who live here, this is a nightmare, I don't think people can live like this".
There are many things to consider now, as this house is likely to become a bad Cornwall element.
This family is notorious, their names are equally notorious.
The couple have three sons, and they live here from time to time.Police said the family's terrorist acts included using baseball bats to fight in the streets, intimidating nearby residents, smoking drugs, trafficking in drugs, shouting, arguing and cursing.
In June, a 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received an antisocial behavior resolution.
In this house that may have been demolished, many rooms were left with long-term trash.
In a room that was once a drug-dealing area, the floor was raised.
Neighbors said they often saw them fighting in the street, and often called the police.
After giving them an 11-week extension to move voluntarily, the Cornwall Housing Association forced her and her husband to leave the house this week.
Neighbors who finally relaxed their spirits were cheering for this, saying that their previous lives were simply a hell of a human being.
A neighbor said: "They don't care about anyone".
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it was always so bad.
We've seen police come through the door countless times.
This morning, we were unable to sleep.
We get up early because it's so quiet here that we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, it's great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the executive manager of the Cornwall Housing Association's district, said the family was not well-suited to local government.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, and police visited them often.
Garbage and old toys were thrown into the side of the rental house.
He added: "Unfortunately, the landlord was not held responsible for her and her family's behaviour, and eviction was the last thing the Cornwall Housing Association considered.
This is a very difficult case to deal with, because their behavior is extremely extreme, and their actions must have frightened the neighbors.
I am grateful for the work of my team, but also to the Devonshire and Cornwall Police and the members of the community who have bravely provided us with information.
I hope this move will bring some comfort to our neighbors and send a message: we are absolutely intolerant of antisocial behavior.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said that their three sons had all lived in the house at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
After they were evicted, a dirty bed was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
Housing union workers quickly cleaned up the garbage pile around the house.
In 2014, police searched the house, found more than 70 acres of cannabis, and found a tin tinplate, drug paraphernalia and 1,700 pounds in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and intent to distribute them.
She claimed the money was used to buy the tombstone for Lee Skeldon, his son who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is reported that after becoming homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the apartment complex are painted with paint.
Police said they would expel tenants who violated the tenant rules.
Angela Crowzh, of the Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction issued a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the tenant rules.
"This warning is directed to those who believe that their actions will not be blamed, and to those who have been devastated by such actions", she said.
Devonshire and Cornwall Police have a strong dislike for crime and anti-social behaviour, and will continue to work with partners to protect our community.
Read: Hillary Clinton, the president-elect, will nominate Galdand to the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was confident that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were elected president, she would nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have been blocking confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the next president will select this person to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reed said in a conference call Thursday that he predicted Hillary would choose some credible talent.
A spokeswoman for Reed later said that Reed had not nominated Galande directly for a conversation with Hillary, saying he was merely speculating.
He added great appreciation for Galandzh and said that Hillary's team did not want to be ruined by the new recruitment.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the District of Columbia.
Reed said the Republican who blocked Garland's nomination was the "servant and accomplished" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for the presidency.
Treats: Naked diaries are loved by both men and women.
Treats magazine will be working with photographer David Bellemere to shoot a set of inspirations from the 2017 Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models, rather than famous nudists, for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw said earlier this year that they were using a nude-based magazine differently from the older generation of gay men, as the latter were aimed at men.
We are, however, directed towards women.
He obviously thinks the same thing about the calendar group.
We need to show off the eternal, classic nudity that makes both women and men feel comfortable, and this time it was inspired by that,Shaw said at a calendar introduction conference.zh
Women will be happy to take part in this shoot, as it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photo recruitment online, or they can personally apply to public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.

A French court dismissed a petition to demolish a shop in the Zhongzheng refugee camp.
A French court rejected the government's request to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Zhou refugee camp, which currently houses thousands of refugees.
At the court's hearing this week, the Government of France argued that the French government should have the right to demolish a total of 72 temporary shops in the refugee camp.The people in these shops in the refugee camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, provide hair care services, and sell tea or basic meals for 50 cents ($40 USD) in temporary restaurants.
The office of the Governor of Cali believes that these areas should be demolished, as they are a tax-free parallel economy, and there are also fire and sanitary hazards.
Humanitarian groups have said that these shops and restaurants are of great importance to the court, as free food provided by state-supported associations and other groups is simply not enough to meet the growing needs of the refugee camp.
They say that these temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Riyadh ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling the operators of the 72 temporary stores, but said the concerns of Governor Gale were fully understandable.
Judge Jean François Mollazh said that the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants was far more than simply providing food to refugees living in extremely dangerous conditions.
He said these places were a peaceful meeting point between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition is the refugee camp's Jungle Book Kids café, which offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and offers shelter advice to hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure of this cafe would be a major disaster for these children (many of whom are only eight years old).
Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, both charitable organizations, estimated Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle refugee camp had surpassed 9,000, the highest level since the summer surge in refugee numbers.

She said gratefully: "I thought my father had died, my brother and I had not gone to college, I had no idea that the county had solved our problems in time.
As of August 8, 2017, the school had implemented more than $21 million in various rescue funds for 13,140 impoverished students in the first half of this year.
All of the county's poorest students have been able to get the most out of the assistance they deserve.

The reporter learned from the National Taxation Office today that, as of the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels had published 2470 tax breaches on the blacklist.
It is understood that in July 2014, the National Tax Administration, a pioneer in the central government functional sector, in conjunction with the Tax Credit Management Mechanism, released a measure to disclose information on major tax breaches.

Environmental issues are reflected in air, water, and soil pollution, but they also have roots in the way of life.
For example, in 2015, Jiangsu province's land development rate was as high as 21%, and ranked among the highest in the country.
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, large energy, and land use have not yet been radically addressed by a shift in the production lifestyle.
On the one hand, the country is ranked first in terms of absolute advantage in terms of the results of creating all kinds of ecological environments at all levels of Jiangsu province; but on the other hand, the resource environment bears a lot of pressure.
Strongly promote environmental protection and governance, there is a need to fundamentally promote transformation of the production lifestyle, to promote transformation of the people and the environment in order to build ecological civilization.

Qingdao is the 12th city in the country and the first city to be a pilot city for the paid use and trading of pollution rights in Shandong Province.
On 11th, several companies came to the city of Qingdao's pollution control trading center to submit a pollution control application, and after receiving the application, they will pay a fee for use.
This upcoming transaction forecast also marks the official start of the pilot work of the Qingdao Purification Trading Facility, which will also be the first provincial Purification Trading Facility and the first national city-level Purification Trading Facility.
On the morning of 11th, the general manager of Qingdao Bierzh Peach Precision Chemical Works Ltd. 秀平 came to the Qingdao City Pollution Rights Trading Centre to submit a filing for the Pollution Rights.
The company is located in the factory district of the old town of Qingdao, China, and at the end of last year it completely stopped production, moving the environmental protection to a new factory district with a flattened level.
After 秀平 submitted the application form, the environmental impact report of the construction project, and other materials, the Center for Pollution Control and Trading Services of the City of Qingdao began the preliminary examination of the application materials.
According to the charging criteria set by the departments of prices, finance and other sectors of the city of Qingdao, the estimated initial use of the pollution control currently estimated at about 6412 thousand yuan, the staff will complete the approval in seven working days.

Existing pollution units that have received an environmental review before January 1, 2016, are not subject to a paid usage fee.
 Paying for the right to pollute is not the same as obtaining the right to pollute illegally, nor can you arbitrarily release pollutantszh
Vice-director of the Environmental Protection Agency of Qingdao City, Han Redzhong explained that if illegal pollution, excess pollution still has to be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid the penalty by buying the pollution rights.
That is, through legal means, to crack down on environmental violations, to severely punish corporate over-pollution, thereby protecting the environment, safeguarding public health.
Now, for their own sake, companies have increased their pollution control drive, valued limited pollution rights, and reduced pollution emissions.
Driven by economic interests, reducing emissions of pollutants will shift from government enforcement to business-conscious market behaviour, thereby truly achieving the goals of protecting the environment, protecting nature, and protecting public health.
The right to discharge, also known as the right to discharge, is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of the emitter to discharge pollutants into the environment within the limits allocated by the government, according to the law.
This right is essentially the polluter's right to own, use and profit from environmental capacity resources.
The next step, provided that the total emissions of pollutants do not exceed the permitted emissions, is to exchange the intermodal emissions of pollutants between the internal sources of pollutants by means of currency exchanges.
Since the clearance of pollution rights was proposed in 1968 by the American economist Dale, the United States began to apply it in the 1970s to the management of air and river pollution sources.
Our country has been conducting pilot projects since 2007, and 14 provinces, districts, cities, and other provinces are currently in full operation.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, to assist these six strategic bombers in carrying out airstrikes against Islamic State targets inside Syria, several Russian fighter jets provide support from the airbase in Khemayimzh, Syria.
On February 22, the United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the Syrian conflict, and the ceasefire agreement went into effect on July 27.
Under the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against UN-designated terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State-backed front.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian soldiers will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if extremist forces are not attacked, they will spread to Russia.
While Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on jointly combating extremist forces in Syria, Russia will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran, Iraq and others in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia responded to the invitation of the Syrian government to launch a military strike against extremist forces in Syria.

The Shanghai Metropolitan Municipality's Matsuzha District traffic authority recently used electronic police to fix driver driving and mobile phones, searches of more than 30 vehicles a week.
With the popularity of smartphones, mobile phones are becoming more and more fun, browsing weebly, tweeting, even playing games, and it seems that many people are forced to keep their phones open, even when driving, and not stop.
The Road Traffic Safety Act prohibits driving with a mobile phone and defines it as "an act that hinders safe driving".
Unfortunately, due to the number of offenders, the difficulty of obtaining evidence, etc., this phenomenon has not been punished, the legal provisions have almost become obsolete.
If the authorities could decide to declare war on driving and mobile phone gambling, and normalize this measure, such violations would be curtailed.
To ensure strict household record management, to establish electronic and paper records of the material for the registration of household records of persons without a household record, to ensure that the file information is fully valid.
The public safety authority should take into account the status of account registration of persons without a home, and inform the relevant authorities in a timely manner.
Any policy measures that do not conform to the spirit of this implementation will be subject to a single, comprehensive, and thorough clearance, a thorough review, and a final repeal.
In a collective shed in the village of Donglin, Taishō, King Shefengzh, 48, was taking his workers to spray pear trees with pesticides.
150 orchards, 10 tree species, only 12 workers and 1 technical engineer are needed.
Last year, $50,000 in total, for someone my age, who worked in a factory, would not have been enough money.
Last year, the income of the village of Donglin Village reached 22 million yuan, of which nearly half of the total agricultural income was generated.
村書記苏齐芳: The per capita land area is growing every year, starting at 50, now it is over 100; the average yield is increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers is also growing every year.
The biggest highlight of the reform of the collective economic reform of the Sunzh village, which is to be quantified by the shares per village, is the clear ownership of the collective operational assets of the village and the exploration of the separation of powers.
In July 2015, 14 Rural Economic Cooperation (REC) organizations were organized in the Sihansan Town Square of Wuxi City with the local village committee, the village committee performs the rural public affairs management, the cooperative is mainly engaged in business.
The two institutions, which are mutually exclusive, prevented the village staff from participating in the collective asset management of corruption.
Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Commission Deputy Director Shie Baoping said Jiangsu will continue to push for reform of the community share-sharing cooperation system, encourage farmers to jointly develop, and establish a democratic power-sharing mechanism at the village level.
祝保平: to further advance reform, to engage community-owned cooperation, to quantify assets to employees, to fix to farmers, to form clear ownership rights.
 Through the Internet+, the implementation of his right to know, the right to participate in decision-making and the right to supervise democratic management, the three rights of farmers, indeed, made it a standard operating mechanism for joint stock companies
Currently, the new collective economy of Sunan Rural District mainly forms the four types of development models: asset lease type, corporate share type, agricultural development type, co-development type.

Zhangzh: Beautiful handsome started shooting roadside career several times in reverse.
Zhang Dong Red of Dong Park Village in the Xamenxiang An District just a few days ago replaced an old 29 inch TV in his home with a 65 inch TV.
The daughter of an ordinary farmer, she was the silver medalist for China in the women's 50m rifle triple jump final at the Rio Olympics on the evening of 11th.
On the night of the 11th, just before this new TV show, Zhang Dongzh and dozens of close relatives and friends witnessed their daughter's quest to come straight from the near-preliminary to the near-reversal of the magical process.
In the same day's race, Zhang once floated down the rankings, seemingly far from the final.
But his parents and friends didn't give up, constantly browsing live, watching as the other players finished, Zhang's name rose up, finally locking up a final seat, his home moment exploded from a moment of cheerfulness.
In the final, Zhangzhong once again, after being ranked second, took the last few shots steadily, winning silver medals with only 0.2 rings behind the champion.
Zhangzhong, who is 27 years old this year, has, in his 16-year shooting career, almost repeatedly rubbed the hard-to-get silver medal with this piece.
Her mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told reporters that while they were hesitating, Zhang found several novelists from the same village.
These  novel客zh were the same village children who were recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang's cousin.
Shortly after joining the team, Zhangzhong again moved back to school in Xi'an for reasons such as family difficulties.
But after repeatedly working with his coach Zhang Xiaojie, Zhang returned to the team.
After joining the provincial team, Zhang Zhen was unable to make the national team due to a delay, and once again returned home due to a lack of hope.
This time, not only Zhang Yie's coach, the Zhengmen Shooting Rocket Center and the Fujian Provincial Team's leaders and coaches came home, eventually persuading Zhang to return to the provincial team.
As in yesterday's game, this girl of the Golden Gloves' persistence has made a reversal in the shooting process.
 Each coach selects their teammates differently, so when I saw the handsome looks of the coach, I immediately noticed the picture.
Zhang Tzong Red also recalled that during the training test, her daughter, although not the best, performed a steady number of rings, which is also an important reason Zhang Zhong attracted the coach.
During the training of Zhang Zhi, Zhang Xiaojie was most impressed by the contribution of this peasant girl.
He recalled that Zhangzh joined the Xamen firing squad more than a year later, and underwent a long-term, long-range shooting training in the squad, requiring the team members to be unable to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that his daughter was always a quiet child, and from an early age she loved to draw and make handmade toys.
I used to make clothes at home, make supplements, and make dolls myself.
She said her daughter often makes her own handmade toys, and in addition to her skill at painting, from doll's five senses to clothing, she can always do the same.
As an athlete, Zhangzh and his family gathered less and less, only on holidays he could return home, usually by phone.
According to his parents, whether it was meeting or calling, Zhangzh rarely spoke about his hardship, rather talking about fun things with his parents.
While their daughters are not often seen, parents carefully store their daughter's childhood paintings and her years of honor at home.
Zhang Xiaolong showed her daughter's cartoons to reporters, and if she wasn't a shooting athlete, she should still be painting.
In the second floor living room of Zhang Zheng, there was a cabinet full of medals, medals and certificates she had received.
Zhang Tzong Red arranged the medals and medals in a neat way, and the certificates were united in a file, preserved, these are the honors that have been exchanged for decades, and we all cherish them.
Recently, the Hebei Province's Toshiyō Foundation sent 16,000 yuan of consolation money to the families of the 6 families who lost their families in villages such as Littlebooks, Taipei, and Guizuzun in Hebei province.
This is yet another consolation-and-love campaign that the foundation has launched to society in search of the inspiration for children and lonely elderly who have been lost in the 7.19 floodwaters.
7.19 strong rains have caused extensive damage to many areas of Hebei Province, causing flooding disasters in parts of the province, and resulting in deaths and disappearances of personnel.
The impressive work of the good man, who helped the village to drain the water, leaving behind a two-year-old and a wife of six, touched the entire province.
On August 4, the staff of the Hebei Provincial Kindness Foundation and volunteers from the Hebei Brand Association came to the home of the good man, to give 3,200 yuan of love to the family of the old man.
When the vice president of the Brands Association, Yelli, learned of the situation of the family members of the old railway company, she immediately decided to launch a charitable sales campaign among the company members of the Brands Association, helping the family to share the pain.

According to the Hong Kong Daily News, 12 August, there are currently three main problems with the sale of land-based diamonds, including the purity of the diamond, the price of the diamond, the weight of the diamond, the unsecured after-sale, and so on.
And Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers, with local artisans' diamond cutting technology known to the underworld, and the diamonds sold through rigorous identification are welcomed by the ladies of the mainland.
A small bag, a handshake, a small slice of light, worth nearly a million yuan, a family member involved in the purchase of diamonds, told mainland media about her experiences in Antwerp in June this year.
She pointed out that she had hidden the diamond in her underwear, went to the bathroom for several days straight, took a bath, and slept on the road.
She said the diamonds purchased in Antwerp cost about $55,000 per carat, and the quality diamonds at the gate were about $111,000 in retail price.
She had bought the diamond for a price of two percent more, sold all the diamonds she had bought, once exceeding 200,000 yuan.
According to the customs regulations of the inland, diamonds are not passenger goods or essential goods in the journey, therefore belonging to the category of goods, must be declared at the time of entry, otherwise the situation is classified as smuggling, and serious imprisonment is punishable.
According to foreign media reports, on 10th July, local time, the British Prime Minister's Office announced in Downing Street: British Prime Minister Theresa May will be in Switzerland for her summer vacation, but did not disclose a specific location.
According to media reports, after the Brexit referendum, the new British prime minister chose to go on a holiday to the European continent, with some political symbolism.
The symbolism of Switzerland's representation of this neutral country played a role in the choice of the UK Prime Minister's first holiday destination.
British Daily Telegraph's comments noted that Theresa May chose to go on a Swiss holiday, which was the first time a British prime minister had gone on a Swiss holiday since Mrs. Thatcher.
The choice of two female prime ministers and the choice of two male prime ministers, Blair and Cameron, to go on vacation to hotter places, formed the opposite.
It is reported that the new British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will return to London on 24 August, after which a series of important tasks and activities await her.
The British Parliament will meet again on 5 September, and the debate will include the online demand for a second Brexit referendum.
A British referendum on 23 June decided to leave the EU, but the new British Prime Minister refused to launch the content of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on membership of the EU before the end of the year.

China's Mars program has arrived.
Our mission to Mars will be to orbit, land, and patrol once, a form never seen before abroad.
Our country's mission to launch a Mars exploration mission is to take one step around, land, and patrol, a task that is quite difficult.
Since a Mars probe takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are rigorously developing an engineering plan, aiming to launch our first Mars probe in 2020 at this window.
According to Shue Dazhe, although China's aircraft have entered deep space, the completion of the Mars mission is still essential, as exploring Mars means that China has entered the era of deep space exploration in a real sense.
 Every two or three years, only once in a lifetime, the launch of a Mars probe at this point in time is the most energy-saving of any launching rocket.zh
 Taking into account the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be completed by the Chinese Chongqing-class rocket.
Our country's Mars exploration mission is to achieve one orbit, landing, and patrolling, a form never seen before abroad, and abroad has once planned to achieve one orbit and landing, but the landing has failed.
There are many technical fields involved in Mars exploration, and the most important is that, although Mars is a spacecraft, it has distinctive features compared to general spacecraft.
That is, a Mars detector must be capable of determining the path of travel, detecting dangerous obstacles and obstacles.
According to Professor Ponzhong, a researcher at the Chinese Space and Science Group, the human exploration of Mars is so beneficial because it has important scientific, technological and even future implications for humanity.
Mars has become the most studied planet outside of Earth, and the history of human exploration using space probes has spanned almost the entire history of human space exploration.
Therefore, mankind hopes to one day establish a residential base on Mars, eventually migrate to Mars, and make it a second home for mankind.
There is also a large amount of evidence that Mars was likely to be like Earth before, but only after billions of years of evolution, the atmosphere became thin, the temperature lower, the water resources depleted, and so on.
Therefore, exploration or manned landings on Mars could provide a blueprint to prevent the Earth from becoming the second Mars that is unlikely to survive for humans.
As of June 2016, there have been 114 lunar and 43 martian missions worldwide.
However, from the 1990s to the present, humans have made a total of 18 Mars explorations, while the Moon has only been explored 14 times.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rover vehicles in operation, but only one Moon orbiter and one Moon lander are in operation.
The world's largest space powers have developed a Mars system-targeted exploration program, so it is clear that today's Mars exploration is hotter than that of the Moon.
On November 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe, Mangarizh, becoming the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
Mangariang is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral features of Mars, to explore whether there is methane on Mars and signs of life.
The most difficult part of this mission was that the spacecraft had only one chance to enter the Martian atmosphere after it had been air-formed and landed.
According to Sun Zhejiang, the chief designer of the Mars probe at the headquarters of the Chinese Space Technology Group, Mars mission exploration faces many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure on Mars is very low, only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface, with high uncertainty.
Scientists are not yet fully aware of factors such as its changes and storm-time characteristics.
Mars often forms dust storms in summer, similar to Earth dust weather, which will cause the Mars car to experience a sharp drop in the sunlight energy it receives, and must design a sleeping mode for the Mars car, allowing it to wait patiently for the dust to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere also has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a challenge to the energy supply of Mars' exploration.
This requires a larger solar wing area for the probe, and requires constant adjustment, working hard to orient the probe in the direction of the sun.
Also, the gravitational pull of Mars' surface is only 38% of Earth's, but it is much greater than the gravitational pull of the Moon's surface, so the probe needs more power.
The most central part of this mission is that the spacecraft enters the Martian atmosphere in a gas-shaped and landing process, and the slowdown, once and for all, must ensure success.
Sun Zhejiang said that since Earth is far away from Mars, the entire process cannot be controlled by ground-based real-time, so it must be done independently by the probe itself.
Since there are not many propellants to offset such a high speed, when landing on Mars, the deceleration will depend on the action of the Martian atmosphere, however, the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
The general approach to exploring Mars is similar to that of exploring the Moon, but also to orbiting, falling, roaming, and finally achieving the goal of manned landings on Mars.
Since Mars is farther from Earth than the Moon, exploring Mars requires tackling a series of more complex technical challenges.
According to Taiwanese media reports, Taiwanese President Zheng Zhenglong announced yesterday morning that political parties and their affiliated organizations have unlawfully obtained the property regulation that came into effect today.
The vice-chairman of the Nationalist Party, Janzh启, said that a more than a hundred-year-old Nationalist Party, with a commitment and responsibility to society, would not collapse like this.
Lin Liang stressed that if a political party, affiliated organization or trustee violates the provisions of regulations that prohibit execution, the committee will investigate the powers of the office and punish them accordingly.
Linh Liang also announced the election of the vice-chairman of the Party's Unfair Products Committee, to be held by Hong Pyong, deputy director of the Taiwanese Ministry of Justice.
He said that the committee of the party's product committee, which was elected by both parties by Kujiang as chairman, will be based on Hong's experience in major cases related to past party investigations, which will serve as the basis for the committee's investigation of the party's product.
Jan Jahan believes that as long as there is still Party product today, no one will give you social contributions, if the whole Party product is taken away, the National Party can only ask for social support and sponsorship, today there really is no opportunity to ask for it.
Jan Jhaug also stressed that even after the unfair party product regulations were put in place, the NPC product was not fully refilled, confiscated, the rest would still be donated as promised, the party product allowed to go to zero, the party needed to start all over again.
Original title:  走廊医生兰越峰zh v.央视主持人王志安 荣誉侵犯一审诉讼
Following the comments made by the central television host Wang Xiang on his Sina Weibo account about the incident, Wang Xiang and Beijing Micromania Enterprise Network Technology Limited were brought to court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haizhzheng court ruled on the case, ruled that Wangjian and Microman did not constitute an infringement, and dismissed all claims by Lanvietfeng.
In early 2014, a survey by the Central Television journalist Wang Zhiang found that despite the fact that the media portrayed Rangi Viet Pong, who sat in the hospital hallway for more than 600 days, as a sad hero under the pressure of the regime, these reports contained a wealth of false information.
On March 29, 2014, the program zh hall doctor produced by the Central Television News Survey was broadcast.
There is no evidence to support the various alleged over-medication reports that Ranzhyefen reported to the media.
Wang Zhiang also described why Zhengqing reached this stage in a profile in a profile-certified microblogging, that he was characterized by a distinctly biased personality, etc.
Ranzh Vietfeng has asked Wangjian to remove Weibo, apologise to him and compensate for the spiritual damage of the $100,000 settlement.
During the trial, both sides argued strongly whether Wang Xiang had violated the reputation of Ranviet Peak.
12th day of the week: China's athletics team is busy with women's soccer and four-bike races.
Cycling is expected to achieve an Olympic gold medal, while women's soccer will challenge the two-time world champion Germany, looking forward to a championship run.
Wang Town has been in the spotlight for nearly two seasons, winning silver at last year's Beijing World Championships, and being promoted to individual event champion again at the group stage in May this year.
According to foreign media reports, 27-year-old South Korean archer Zhang Huijian won the gold medal in the women's individual archery event, followed by the group stage and then the Olympic gold medal, becoming a double crowned champion.
Zhang Huijian is considered a great latecomer, who regretted not winning the entry ticket to the last London Olympics, but now proudly stands on the podium of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Huijian won the gold medal in the women's individual javelin throw final at Rio Zamba Boulevard in Brazil, defeating Germany's Lisa Unru in the overall score of 6-2.
She first shot her arrow in the fourth grade of elementary school, and it wasn't until 2014, at the age of 27, that she won her first individual gold medal at the World Cup, a player who came to prominence later.
Zhang Huijian recalls that before high school there was no level of competition that prevented him from competing in national competitions.
Zhang Huijian, who finished fourth in the London Olympics four years ago, missed out on the Olympic ticket, and could only sit down as a colleague and friend to win two gold medals.
Zhang Huijian spoke of his gold medal-winning ambitions after the women's individual archery event, saying that until the end, as soon as possible, he would have fired a single shot, perhaps with good results, heartfelt satisfaction.
The 28-year-old South Korean archer, who won the individual gold medal at the London Olympics, won bronze twice.
Chippewa lost to Zhang Hwizheng in the semifinals, and went on to compete for the bronze medal with Mexican athlete Alec Chandra Valencia.
Oddly enough, the burden of silent gold-digging on the field after securing a bronze medal is imaginable.
First, the coaching staff has accumulated extensive experience in continuous research, followed by scientific training methods, all of which require long-term accumulation.
Archery teams use military training, night-time crossing of cemeteries, and more to help team members focus and stay calm.
Although not yet confirmed, many sources have said that Apple's fall 2016 launch will be held in September, the iPhone7 is really coming.
While Apple has not responded, there have been reports of updates about the new iPhone's features and configuration, and even images of the iPhone 7's live model have been posted online.
The new generation of iPhones can be called a "hot, compact, cheap, cheap"...... If you want to buy a good product for the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, sunning.
This has made people even more disappointed with the new phone, which is bigger, but can't project a holographic image at all!
The iPhone7, like other iPhones, comes with countless secrets before birth.
In addition, several sources claim that the new generation of iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone interface and use Bluetooth connectivity and charging interface, which will allow for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence that can confirm this news is that as early as 2014, Apple allowed headphone manufacturers to produce headphone products connected via a charging interface.
Whether these reports are true or false, the answers will not be revealed until the fall 2016 Apple announcement.
But this does not prevent people in the industry from seeing the iPhone7's outlook - many believe that the iPhone7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone range.
Although, according to data released by the recent market research agency IDC, the iPhone's market share has declined.
Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained Apple's stock purchase rating, while analysts at BMO believe the iPhone7 will have a historic sales record.
At the same time, Boutron CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely exceed 20%, which is entirely due to the launch of the iPhone7.
Seven percent of respondents said they plan to buy an iPhone7, compared to just four percent two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of users who currently own an iPhone6 or 6Plus plan to purchase an iPhone7, a fairly high proportion.
Second, according to expert analysis, most fruit flavors prefer to be replaced with their own iPhone phones.
According to statistics, of all iPhone users, about 26% of users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have used an iPhone in two years.
According to some media reports, during the iPhone7 production, Taiwan experienced several earthquakes, the extent of damage to the battery production facilities exceeded expectations, and could affect the initial iPhone7 supply.
The supply and demand contradictions affect the average user, it's time to choose a good channel, the first time low price to get good iPhone7.
According to sources, in recent years, the Suning senior leadership has met with Apple Inc. frequently, with the aim of providing adequate supplies.
The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and it can be predicted that as the two sides work together, it will inevitably bring users lower prices and more attentive services.
At the lowest price, consumers can buy an iPhone for only 7 yuan a day.
With ample supplies and a variety of offers, buying an iPhone7 will no longer be a stressful experience, while the logistics of Suning will make this good experience more intuitive.
Maybe, you'll get a phone call in the middle of the night, hello, sleepy shopping, your iPhone7 has arrived.
Through the cultural exhibition, the organisers hope to give local people a better understanding of the historical Chinese culture, thereby increasing mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries.
The exhibition of the Ming Dynasty in Barcelona is part of the European Tour, which will run until early October.

As the water of the spring pool turns blue-green, the events of the Rio Olympics have recently received much attention outside the country.
However, on the morning of the 10th, the water of the water polo pool adjacent to the swimming pool also turned green.
The Australian water polo player said after the match that his eyes were stinging, and he wanted to tear.
Earlier, Rio Olympic officials confirmed the pool's water color change to green, saying that the pool's water color change was due to a debilitating sexual response, and would not affect the athlete's physical health.
But the Australian athlete, who said he had a stinging eye after winning a game against Japan's national team in the water polo pool, said he was suffering from a stinging eye.
At first, after the pool turned green, the competition organizers overworked to handle the pool problem on the evening of the 9th, but on the morning of the 10th, they noticed that the color of the pool also changed rapidly.
During the match between Australia and Japan, the environmental conditions of the pool gradually deteriorated, but the official emphasis was that they would restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colour on the 11th.
Rio Olympic spokesman Andrada said: "Yesterday afternoon, the water level in the spring pool first weakened.
 We understand a range of causes that may cause pool water to change color and the water content.
The Centre for Water Sports conducted a series of water quality tests, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used a pool to determine if water quality conditions met the standard.
 These days we have been running the normal procedure, but we may have overlooked the more likely an athlete is to have an impact on water quality
 But water color changes are certainly not affected by physical health, especially athletics.
 This independent team confirmed our assessment, as well as the measures we have taken to restore the pool to normal color and chemical statuszh
We would have liked the pool to have returned to its normal color in the morning, but the recovery rate was affected by the rain.
According to Taiwan's Central Agency, an explosion at a prison in the outskirts of the capital city of Manila occurred last night, injuring the prison director, killing 10 prisoners, reportedly including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN TV reported that the incident occurred at around 9pm yesterday in the Paranáguay City Jail, but the police did not make a preliminary statement until 2am today.
The police said that the 10 prisoners had asked for a meeting with the warden, filed a complaint for removal of custody, but neither side had any speculation, and that the prisoner had thrown a grenade, resulting in an explosion.
The prison has not yet released the names of the death row inmates, but GMA TV reported that two Chinese prisoners were among them.
As of 8 a.m., the prison has not yet provided detailed explanations, including how the inmates obtained the grenades.
Yesterday, Central Philippine Police entered the Leyte Provincial Prison, killing one inmate who attempted to attack the police station.
Urumqiz regulations for the tourist retail market order of operation The travel agency must sign a contract with the tourist.
Now that Xinjiang has entered the tourism boom season, the tourism enforcement team of the U.S. Transportation Administration's Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Branch yesterday examined issues such as non-regulatory tourism vehicles on the retail market, low rates of contracts signed by travel agencies and tourists.
At eight in the morning yesterday, around the hotel Kevinski parked about 10 buses full of tourists, most of which were scattered passengers heading for a day trip to the pool.
Hello, I'm from the Urumqi City Tourism Board, have you signed up with this travel agency?
Staff of the law enforcement team of the Urumqi Municipal Transportation Administration: Tourist cars and tram lines operate tourist transport projects in Urumqi market, without professional qualifications.
Excessive range operations are subject to a fine of three to 100,000 yuan for this penalty, and driver without a certificate of professional qualifications is subject to a fine of 2,000 yuan
It is understood that previously, the tourism enforcement department of the city of Urumqi had inspected places with tourist scattered traffic such as West Park, Red Mountain and other places.
In the context of two comprehensive inspections, the deputy commander of the tourism enforcement unit in the city of Urumqizh, Mar, said: First is safety, second is regulation, tour vehicles are small, once a problem arises, the crowd is dead.
 We and the transportation authorities jointly conduct continuous market inspections, regulate the travel agency's vehicle behaviour and ensure the safety of visitors
On the morning of 12 August, the State Department's press office held a press conference on the state of the national economy in July 2016.
The head of the National Economy Comprehensive Statistics Department, Sheng Liang, said in July that some indicators of growth in the national economy slowed down in July, but still operated within a reasonable range.
The figures released by the Office for National Statistics show that data on growth in fixed assets and investment in July, as well as total imports, have been declining.
As luck would have it, I would like to quote a quote from the Prime Minister about the national economy in July, which is still moving in a positive direction, which can better summarize the characteristics of the July economic performance.
He explained that the volatility of the July economic indicator was indeed downward.
Because the domestic and foreign economy was still in a deep adjustment in July, the international situation was complex and varied, and the global economy did not recover as expected, export pressures were still relatively high.
From a domestic perspective, the entire economy is still in a critical stage of adjustment, adjustment pain is loosening, the economy is facing considerable downward pressure, so some indicators are fluctuating somewhat.
In July, there was another special case, where the flood disaster was more severe, and the high-temperature, hot-hot weather had some effect on production operations in some areas.
According to a recent report by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people were affected nationwide, with direct economic losses exceeding 200 billion yuan.
From the standpoint of industry, investment, transportation, these regions are affected to varying degrees.
The freight weekly traffic growth in July fell by 3.6 percentage points from the previous month, and flood disasters have had some impact on traffic in these areas.
From these factors, it is normal for some indicators to fluctuate in July, and it is also expected.
He said that the trend is still going well, indicating that despite a slowdown in economic growth, the overall economic performance is stable, stable, and steadily improving.
The July CPI rose 1.8%, the RIP rose 0.2%; the July 1-7 CPI rose 2.1%, so the overall price situation was stable.
According to the Chongqing City Meteorological Office portal statistics for high temperature weather in different counties, all other parts of our city can receive varying degrees of high temperature allowance except Yang.
Currently, at least 28 provinces have set the standard for allowances, but the standard for allowances in each province and municipality is not the same, and Chongqing is a way of getting a high-temperature allowance in accordance with the high-temperature working day allowance.
Emissions of not less than 10 yuan per day per person at 35°C or above 37°C; and of not less than 15 yuan per person per day at 37°C or below 37°C.
Employees at high temperatures above 40°C can receive a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan/day (except for workers who have already been granted a statutory allowance for high-temperature work) 
According to this standard, the highest number of high-temperature weather days in the previous month could reach 330 yuan, the lowest number of days could reach 80 yuan, and the highest temperature could not be higher than the high-temperature standard, so there was no high-temperature allowance.
In the past, many units have rushed to the high-temperature allowance with cool drinks, and the city's security watchdog has said this behavior is not in line with current practice.
Due to high temperature, work stoppages and reduced working hours, the workforce unit may not be deducted or reduced in wages.
The city's Civil Society Agency said employees who work in high-temperature conditions but are denied high-temperature benefits can seek legal benefits through the company's labor dispute settlement agency, or call 12,333 to file a complaint.
If a unit of personnel refuses to issue a high-temperature allowance, workers can complain to the competent authority for social security for human resources above the county level where the work is being done.
At the same time, since the high-temperature allowance is part of the salary, not the benefit, it should be included in the total salary, deductions from individual taxes.
Therefore, the high-temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage range, it must be issued in cash, cannot be replaced by physical items such as drinks.
The newly built station in Urumqizh is located in the high-speed rail segment of Urumqi, with the entire building area of about 100,000 square meters.
The ground floor has 1-2 floors for entrance, waiting room and office, commercial space, and the ground floor is the exit level.
Currently, the Urumqiz station is the largest integrated transport hub in Xinjiang, with high-speed rail, rail, bus, taxi, etc. all integrated, with a variety of interchangeable means of transportation available without any connection.
There are three ticketing rooms on the north side of the station and on the south-north side of the station floor, with 39 individual ticketing windows and 34 automatic ticket machines.
In terms of check-in, there are 30 passages on either side of the waiting room east, passengers can quickly check-in based on the check-in number on the ticket.
If you need help, you can choose from 41 call buttons set up near the power station, and you can get a timely service.
From July 1, the passenger train from the old bus station, or Urumqi Zinan station, will be moving to Urumqi Zhin station in stages.
That is, all the cars and 30 couples of trains can be parked at the station in Urumqizh.
Now both stations can buy tickets for a ride, and the train travels between them in about 10 minutes, so travelers need to pay attention to the specific station of ticketing and the name of the terminal.
The official commissioning of the new station will be an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national integrated transportation city, promote the economic zone of the Silk Road and build a new zone.
The Gracia is a female giant-mouthed bird, which spreads the breath of the tropical rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the giant-mouthed bird Gracia and its story have long been known as household names.
At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who had been treated for surgery, finally made her debut, showing her new 3D printed plastic bird to the public.
This giant bird that died a year and a half ago after being broken up by humans has finally been reincarnated.
Not only does this day announce that it has been 100% restored to health, but it is also the day it moved into a luxurious bird sanctuary, where it will meet with human friends who care about it.
The first newly arrived Grazia was slightly more prominent, but not often she came alive, roaming around the pool, eating grapes with fresh juice.
To remind people of the damage it has suffered, technicians did not give it a new color, but instead kept the original white color of the 3D printed material.
Outside the bird is a thin layer of corners, inside is empty, with only a few fine skeletal supporting rods intersecting.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the larval bird's jaws are still fragile, shattering when injured.
The Animal Rescue Center, a birdwatchman and a US 3D printing company worked together to create several experiments for Gracia, eventually creating the perfect fit for her.
Today, Gracia is able to master the use of fresh water, eating, and even growing small grains of wheat.
The design of the final product took about two months, and the printing process took only four or five hours.
3D printing is not a technology of the future, it is already really entering my life. Thomas Lang, chairman of SG3D Printing USA, said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, a body of blood-sucking giant bird Gracia was found on a farm in the Alajuela province of central Costa Rica.
At the time its upper reaches were brutally broken by a group of young men, it was completely unable to eat, life threatened.
After the tragedy in Gracia was reported in the media, protests against animal cruelty erupted outside Costa Rica.
They demanded stricter animal protection laws, increased punishments for abusers.
People came willingly, doing their best to help Gracia recover as much as possible from her life before she was injured.
Even Chuck Heller, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of the Gracia Upper.
The situation in Gracia is very special, its upper part is less than 1 cm, so installing new ones can be a lot of trouble.
 We first scanned Grazia, then designed, produced an extension of the remainder of the body slightly longer than it was, with a sticky surface attached to it.
 This could reduce further invasive harm to Gracia.Long told Xinhua International.
Before installing the fake, staff must clean up the glacier every day to prevent infection.
Far beyond a thousand miles away, the story of the giant bird Gracia was inspired by the famous documentary director La Eredia and exploration news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the installation of the new Gracia, recorded a documentary, The Land of the Giant Mockingbird, which was broadcast on the Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary, The Land of the Mockingbird, showed people how one tiny, small, mocking bird made a difference in a country, how to get the entire nation involved in the fight against animal cruelty.
核心提示: Japanese oil companies have especially warned against the rise of China's small independent refinery known as 茶zh.
Japan's largest oil company, JX Energy, believes China's expansion of exports is one of the reasons for the slump in the market.
Japanese oil companies have been particularly wary of the rise of small independent refineries in China, known as zh茶.
The quality of China's oil products is gradually approaching that of Japan, due to the Chinese government's stricter environmental regulations.
Before obtaining a permit to import crude oil, tea refineries generally refined heavy oil with higher sulfur content imported from Russia and other places.
The high sulfur content of the oil produced, poor oil quality, are among the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining a permit to import crude oil, the refinery was able to import lower sulfur content of Amman crude oil and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its petroleum products also improved.
According to the company, as China's domestic oil product quality standards continue to improve, the capacity of refining equipment has also improved.
As a result, the quality of China's oil products exported gradually reached the same level as Japan's highest quality in the world.
JX Energy said that after the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia, competing with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Despite the fact that Japan's high-tech oil industry is facing a crisis, the response strategy adopted by Japanese oil companies is to export only to profitable regions while focusing on market trends.
Given the enormous impact of China's export of petroleum products on the Asian market, the attention of the tea-z refinery is also increasingly high.
Since the start of the 2016 Janyoung Nightly Interest Group Solar Aid campaign on May 26, after two months of registration, the total number of poor schoolchildren applying for grants has reached more than 800.
During the course of the fellowship, more than 1.2 million yuan in social contributions have been received, which can help at least 240 students of the Khangmen Zhongdren University.
Currently, donations are ongoing, and the paper calls on the community to continue to reach out, so that more children in families struggling can receive funding, community care, and support.
To ensure that the teaching assistance is fair, open, transparent, this paper began today by distributing basic information on the teaching of the subject, today by releasing the first 100 students, and receiving reader supervision.
The Li Group Solar Assistant Initiative, a well-known Chinese charitable brand, has been running in Jiangsu since 2003, and has funded more than 4,000 poor children in total.
The funding for this activity is for the admission of freshmen to the undergraduate program of Higher Education, excluding free specialties; physical education and education, family poverty and social exclusion.
According to the Office for National Statistics, New Zealand's population growth had previously exceeded 2% during the peak of the baby boom population in 1974 and the 1950s to early 1960s alone.
As of June this year, New Zealand's net immigration inflow in 12 months was 691 million, making it the main driver of population growth in recent years.
In addition, over the same period, New Zealand's natural population growth rate was 2.82 million.
Data shows that in the last decade, New Zealand's average annual net immigrant inflow was 218,000 and the average annual population growth rate was 323,000.
From a demographic perspective, the large influx of immigrants means that the proportion of the working age population aged 15 to 39 will gradually expand.
In the 12 months to June 2016, the working-age population in New Zealand grew by 3.6% to 1,58 million.
At the same time, the population of older people over the age of 65 also increased by 3.6%, reaching 700,000.
Yesterday at 10 a.m., X9003 international freight convoys left the Xi'an-Nizuk Station and headed for Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The train's journey, which marks the first time the Zhejiang Railway has successfully surpassed 10,000 since its Central Asian international freight run in 2013.
It is understood that the goods class of this class of freight transportation includes six main categories of industrial raw materials, mechanical equipment, industrial parts, building materials, food, light industrial products, a total of 206 varieties.
As of August 11, 2016, the station had a total of 221 lines of 229 vehicles, with a cumulative export shipment of 33,80,000 tonnes, of which 84 lines were operated in 2016, an increase of 47% compared to 2016.
It is understood that the goods carried by the first batch of Central Asian ships were all made in the West, but today it has attracted a large number of foreign supplies to the active list.
As of the end of July, the volume of containers in the Central Asian group of companies had surpassed 64,000, an increase of 8% from the same period in 2015.
With the launch of the Central Asian encryption line, the Xi'an Railway Agency's newly built station freight traffic increased year by year.
In 2015, the whole-year freight throughput of the new station was 247.7 million yuan, and as of August 10, 2016, the freight shipment volume had reached 153.1 million yuan, an increase of 6.7% over the same period last year.
To meet future development needs, the SZN has already launched a plan to build the SZN Integrated Logistics Center in the center of the new station, with the full effort to build a modern SZN Integrated Logistics Park.
An Indian uncle who just experienced the thrill of a plane landing inside a Dubai International Airport last week, won a $1 million grand prize at the same airport this week.
Mohammed Bashir Abdul Khdar, a longtime resident of Dubai, India, has a habit of buying tickets every time he returns to the country.
His 21-year-old son, who died of an accidental fall 13 days after his birth, has been working hard to pay back his son's medical bills.
"To escape the air crash was to give me a second life, and to give me this money to do good", says Heddar.
Although now it is fall, the strength of the Autumn Tiger seems to be no worse than the summer.
UV rays not only make the skin of classmates darker, but also more sun-drenched, so how can the skin pass through military training without getting sunburned?
The SPF and PA are generally labelled on the sunscreen packaging, SPF refers to the sunscreen index, is for UVB ultraviolet rays, and our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, etc.
Products labeled with PA are targeted at UVA, so sunscreen products will play a more effective role, usually, PA intensity + is used to represent, multiple + is used to represent an effective length of protection time.
Oily skin should choose waterproof sunscreens with a stronger penetration, and sunscreen spraying is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose sunscreen; neutral skin is generally not strictly regulated, any maintenance on sensitive skin rubbing is a burden, it is recommended to choose purely physical sunscreen.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, as sunscreen products take time to fully penetrate the skin.
For longer training days, sunscreen wipes once every two hours to have lasting effects, so don't steal.
Because the skin was just exposed to sunlight, military personnel returned not to use any white products immediately.
After the military exercises, if necessary, ice towels wrapped in ice can be used to cool the burned skin to reduce local drying heat.
Farmers who buy farm machinery during the exhibition, continue to implement the increased subsidy policy, and farmers who buy farm machinery can receive up to 40% subsidy.
This exhibition is geared towards global trade and in particular has increased the invitation to countries along the Belt and Road and to countries in the target market.
The exhibition aims to complete 60 projects of contracting, bring in 22 billion yuan, sign more than 160 trade contracts, contract amount of 3.2 billion yuan.
The reason for the 7 years of continuous implementation of the Hunan Province's main market manufacturing industry is a strong foundation, with a long history of industrial development.
As the host of the J&J, it has established trade relations with more than 90 countries worldwide.
The Expo has become an important platform for promoting local characteristics industry development, and promoting the characteristics industry to expand beyond the borders of the country.
On some nights, the ionization layer is filled with free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go even further.
According to the August 11 report of the American website, the U.S. Air Force is interested in this effect on replication.
While an ionization layer with a stable amount of free electrons can help people listen to the radio on the broadcast range edge of a university radio station, this may not be in the interest of the U.S. Air Force.
An electron-filled ionization layer means that the radio used by the military has a larger transmission range, and it may provide some protection for global positioning system GPS signals, making them immune from the effects of solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cubic-scale satellites based on demand, which can strengthen the ionic layer when needed.
But first, these teams that have signed contracts with the Air Force must prove that the relevant scientific principles will work.
Industry data shows that in 2015, the total coal capacity was close to 6 billion tonnes, while the national coal capacity was over 1.8 billion tonnes.
In the past decade, the State Department has issued five notices of elimination of excess and backward capacity.
Although the first four were not directed at the coal industry, the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry.
From November last year to January this year, the price of coal at long-term lows of 370 yuan/year fell to a loss of 90 percent of coal firms.
Since February, the price of coal has been steadily rising, with the recent rise in the price of coal for the fourth consecutive week, rising to a 16-month high, once rising to 436 yuan per barrel, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
As prices soar, the world is concerned about the consequences: Will a small coal mine be able to reproduce?
In this regard, the analysis and interpretation of the study was carried out by the China Institute of Economics and Development.
明: The decommissioning of energy has attracted a lot of attention, and the decommissioning of coal industry results released today also makes people feel more concerned.
These three surface factors still reflect the relatively backward nature of our past transformation of growth, namely that government-led growth has not yet undergone a fundamental transformation.
Second, this is also directly related to the local government's capacity to drive, in the process of decommissioning, funding and corresponding support measures must be put in place, and in this respect, the differences between regions are indeed significant.
Third, if some of the provinces that are currently slow to progress should catch up in the second half of the year, they may face a greater risk.
In this case, the process of advancing productivity by relying on central grants may have some negative effects.
First, the decomposition of energy is not a simple matter of total control.
Our aim is to rebuild the entire coal industry by eliminating backward capacity, advancing structural optimization, and restructuring the entire coal industry.
In the process of deploying the decommissioning, local governments must combine the conversion upgrades of the decommissioning and coal industries, and dramatically develop the related service industries.
Second, if we want to complete this year's decapacity reduction mission within this year, we still need to make full use of the power of administrative supervision and administrative oversight.
Finally, we need to strengthen the underlying role of social security.
Since the market directly affects employment issues, we need to strengthen the training of employees and employees in employment skills.
The reason for the drop in rankings was that foreign investment deteriorated the expected growth of Brazil's GDP over the medium term.
In 2015, Brazil's share of global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.
The International Investment Attraction Index of RISZ Bank is divided into four main indexes: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment.
In 2015, Brazil's international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, investment in Brazil's green spaces (in the model of foreign investment in factories) was $17.9 billion, down 2.1 percent from the previous year.
There are 288 green space investment projects in Brazil, with an average annual growth of 314 between 2003 and 2014.
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10% compared to the same period last year.
Canadian police killed ISIS supporters: suicide bombing preparations for the city are nearing completion.
The taxi company said the taxi was scheduled to the driver's house before police arrived.
At a news conference Wednesday, the Canadian police said that the information they received included "martyr video" provided by the FBI about the young man who would carry out the attack.
According to German Voice, a man wearing a black barracotta hat is reading the Quran, mentioning crimes against Muslims, and vowing to launch an attack on a Canadian city soon.
He said in the video that the attack would take place within 72 hours, and at peak hours.
This is the first time since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office last year that police have hit a suspected terrorist prematurely.
The upgraded Jinghang Grand Canal branch line, the Taiwan Fu River, the North Grand Slip Canal, will charge a fare from September 1.
Both of these shipping lines have taken the form of social finance to convert construction, the fee has been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The Laowan River waterway runs through the town of Kin, fishing station, through the Yangtze Lake into the main waterway of the Jinghang Grand Canal, a total length of 32.5 kilometers.
 According to the needs of the airline, the Chang'an Fu River shipping channel has been carefully modified, local water depths have been improved, local rapid retrofitting has been done, and the air conditions have improved.
The channel runs through Qingdao County, Ningbo District, through Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Jinghang Grand Canal, a total length of 19 kilometers.
The conversion of the two shipping lanes began construction in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015 with the completion of the delivery of the receipt, investment construction and operation of the Anzhpin Canal Logistics Service Center in Jining City.
In accordance with the principle of construction of loans, charges and loans, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center in Jinin City charges the passage of the shipping line on the basis of the charges standard approved by the Shandong Provincial Commodity Price Administration.
Among them, the basic fare is 1.75 yuan/kg, and the distance is 0.05 yuan/kg.
The time for charging the fare is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
According to the reporter, the Jining City Port Authority has learned that there are currently four charter shipping lanes within Jining, namely the 水河 shipping lanes, the白马河 shipping lanes, the 北大滑梯 shipping lanes, and the老万福河 shipping lanes.
The four shipping lanes are being upgraded and transformed into a sub-shipping line of the Jinghang Grand Canal, each using social finance methods.
The project to upgrade the waterway is the first to adopt a government+market model, to be used for projects to build infrastructure in the Hanseatic port of Shandong, to have government-sponsored capital, to supplement social funds, and to fill the funding gap.
Branch routes such as the White Horse River, the Tawanzh River, the Great Slip River, and others have been marketed purely for their own purposes.
State-funded funds cannot meet the needs of engineering construction, limiting progress in the upgrading of the runway.
Social funds used to build public infrastructure that met the requirements of national policy have also become a way to break the bottle of money.
Ningze's performance in the 100m freestyle semi-final has already silenced many Chinese spectators.
But in the 50m freestyle preliminary heat, Ningzezh once again refreshed the bottom line.
In fact, 50m freestyle swimming is not a major sport, but his performance and best result at the Kassam World Championships also meant that he was unlikely to break through this sport.
Of course, Hong Kong's official media outlet revealed that the biggest reason for Nianzer's failure was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors outside the field, which may have had a major impact on his future thinking, may now be more interested in entering the entertainment world.
After the Kassam World Championship, Ningze became instantly red with its ultra-high value and good results.
Thus, the title of "National Husband", "Little Man", "Flower Man", and so on, have become his personal label.
All kinds of business activities are found, and good money is made, and it becomes a golden avenue.
In this case, even if Ningzezh chose to retire at this time to join the entertainment industry, not only his freedom, but also a seemingly feasible path.
After all, he is only 23, after some education, can fully use his popularity to act in a series or two.
But Nietzsche needs to see if he is qualified enough compared to these predecessors.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, 21-year-old Zheng Zhi has reached the end of his career as an athlete.
Li's appearance quickly made her remembered, and laid the foundation for her future entertainment career.
After retiring,zh starred in several television series, and in 2013 set up his own studio.
Tendai Chang competed in the men's singles 10 metre event at two Olympic Games, winning 2 golds and 2 silvers.
But after losing to teammate Hu Jiazhong in the men's 10m event at the 2004 Olympics, Tan Liang's athletic status declined and he was knocked out by the team.
He and his daughter attend a variety show, such as Where's Daddy Going, and even give him enough eyesight.
The former gymnastics golden generation of Zwei, Lizh小 and Chen Yi Ice all played a high-profile role in various variety shows.
It is worth noting that Zhongwei Li, who led China to the 2008 Olympic men's team title, was also a two-time individual All-Powerful gold medalist, known as the All-Powerful King.
Chen Yi Ice, who led China to the 2012 Olympic group championship, also became the ring king.
And after losing the gold medal at the London Olympics, Chen's ice-sized move also left him with countless circles of dust.
But these athletes are currently concentrating their energy on the field, and for the variety show, they are just as much a touch.
But whether you're a retired or active athlete, being able to gain the favor of the entertainment world requires a successful record to guarantee.
After all, an athlete entering a new realm, whether it be in abilities or in relationships, is a vacuum state.
Even if people like Tendayang,zh, are old enough to remember them, the average audience is still more concerned about their performance at the Olympics.
And newcomers like Zhou Wei, Li Xiaojin, introduced during their appearances on the variety show, are all Olympic champions without exception.
Compared to the few above, the title of a swimming world champion is still somewhat slim.
Moreover, compared to the success of the likes of Tendauang, Zhenwei, Ningze, and Zhenwei, if at the age of 23 years, his sports career is a bit of a setback, he will quickly retreat, and the negative impact on his image is probably unimaginable.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people are asking for a hundred wins, but they are asking for a hundred, and that's a long way from that.
After ten thousand steps, Ningze grew up, fully able to rely on color to get support from tens of thousands of brain-disabled people.
Having no energy, relying only on appearance, trying to mix up in entertainment, is no more difficult than training to find the right response.
The path of life is entirely personal choice, but how to choose, rather than the heart, should be numbered.
On the surface, social networking platforms have expanded the circle of communication, reducing people's feelings of loneliness.
The power of network social is expanding, not only replacing traditional telephone connections, but even entering the real world of online life, and changing the social life of the people today.
The benefits of online social are obvious, such as convenience and speed, so it is especially prone to be favored by younger people.
A survey of college students' social habits showed that 57 percent of college students use their phones for more than five hours a day, a basic part of their daily lives.
 Social networking features such as low cost, fast transmission, multiple people simultaneously communicating, and more, to meet the needs of today's university students
Expanding the circle of adult relationships, having a more equal conversation, avoiding social worries, are the main reasons we are becoming more and more fond of online chatting.
Newcomers love to connect with colleagues online, because they are not as familiar with the unit, through social media, and through the likes and dislikes of their friends.
Lovers of friends also often communicate online, before they were unable to communicate with friends for a while because of some misunderstanding, and later converse in a large group a few words before they become enthusiastic again.
An IT engineer is a deep-rooted social network enthusiast, with most of his social life happening online, and network contacts are many times more numerous than the number of people in an online circle of friends.
I'm also frankly more like a fish that gets water on the net.
 You can answer your friends whenever you want, because there is plenty of time to consider the sentence, and the expression can be clearer.
I often avoid face-to-face interactions, not only have room for rotation, but even give each other more time and space to talk.
 People of different identities have the same right and ability to speak, social anxieties in real life seem to be eliminated all at once in cyberspace
However, my friend, who is a poet, feels that poetry in life is a very uninteresting subject.
The small and the small, as they were both active speakers, quickly became acquainted in a large group.
Little  feel like 言 to judge two people online, the words are boring, not actively commenting, repeating over and over are just a few sentences, well, yes, yes, or no, this is the one I'm going to check out online.
The police have already intervened in the investigation, and the Ministry of Transportation will also step up efforts to correct illegal vehicles.

On August 11, when a reporter was interviewed by phone and returned to Huang Iling's home in Sichuan, she said: "It was so urgent, I had only one thought in my heart - to save lives!
Huang Ilin is a student of the class of 2015 of the Scenic Garden School of South China University.
Huang Ilin, who studied urban and rural planning, wanted to go to Sichuan to study local architectural design, so a family went on a tour.
On August 8, around 10:00 a.m., Huang Ilin's father was resting at the hotel, and his mother and daughter were preparing for the ancient city.
We had just walked a short distance, and suddenly saw a crowd of people shouting, and out of curiosity they went up and down.
The little boy has disappeared, the little girl is struggling in the water, the riverfront only reveals her little head, sometimes drowning, and the little girl, who learned to swim as a child, Jhu Ilynzh, jumps to the rescue.
After going underwater, Yellow Erylen, who was 165 cm tall, found that he could not step on it!
The surface of the water at first seemed calm, but below it was a violent current!
But she still floats to the little girl, despite everything.
黄伊琳 said, "江水,急, less than five meters away, almost spent all her energy".
She tried her best to push the little girl to the riverbank, particularly slippery slopes, and I feared that I was too weak to sink.
So, Huang Ilhjin turned to the cry for help, heard her daughter's cry for help, a water-poor lady prepared to come to the rescue, and was stopped by the next-door tourists.
On August 10, after the story of Huangzhulin's jump-river rescue was spread, Ms. Huang received many commendations from relatives and was also held accountable by many friends.
To tell you the truth, when the child could not hold out on the riverbank, when he cried out to me for help, my heart was broken.
The lady was quite clear that, despite the danger, if she were to be in the same situation again, she would still support her daughter's choice, and she would be proud of her daughter!
Forced to swim, Huang Ilin rarely took action after school swimming, not thinking that this skill was still in use.
According to the chief of staff of Huang Ilingbān, Chen Yi, Huang Ilingbān is a well-known Banyan scholar, and is happy to help.

A group of fraudulent text messages reaching a certain number, even if not fraudulently committed, can be convicted of fraud.
The People's Court of the Guangdong District of Nanyang City, Henan Province, held a hearing in which, from September 30 to October 4, 2015, defendant Li Congwang, using fake base station equipment, sent fraudulent information to the people of Zhejiang County and the southern Yangtze district.

The North-East Tiger, currently listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List, is a species of concern.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin, data from a joint 1998 surveillance of China, the United States, and Russia shows that Jilin has only four to six wild northeastern tigers, three to five northeastern tigers.
According to the Jilin Forestry Department's conservation department, the Jilin province has been steadily increasing wildlife protection in recent years, the population of the northeast tiger in China is growing significantly, the distribution area is expanding steadily.
The latest monitoring data from 2015 shows that 27 wild northeastern tigers and 42 wild northeastern tigers have been observed in the province of Jirin alone.
As the world's flagship species of wildlife protection distributed in the China-Russia border region, cooperation between China and Russia is significant for the recovery and breeding of wild northeast tiger populations.
According to the Jilin Forestry Department, previously Jilin had established a long-term stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the 2016 China International Forum for the Protection of Wildlife, which ended on 11 December 2016, the forestry sector of China and Russia and the animal welfare organization (AWW) once again reached a number of consensus.
The Forestry Department of the Jilin Province said that strengthening cooperation between China and Russia for the protection of tigers is not only a very urgent task facing China's Northeast Tiger Conservation, but also a pressing priority for maintaining the health of the Russian tiger population.
Sun Fu-Khan, a member of the party's leadership staff, lost his idealistic beliefs, severely violated the party's discipline, and still unconvinced, unconvinced, unconvinced, and badly offended after the party's eighteen leaders.
After this case, which was covered by several media outlets, became a focus case, the social impact was very bad.
After the incident, the Haikou Police Department's Police Squadron, led by the Police Department of Haikouzh, placed high emphasis on organizing a large squad of elite police officers to launch an active strike and investigations.
The police immediately executed the suspect's online manhunt, took several measures to contain it, and by contacting the field police, coordinated the landing of the king.
Because the suspect was a convicted burglar, had been repeatedly beaten by the public security authorities, had strong anti-espionage abilities, and was a long-time drug addict, who frequently developed seizures during interrogation, interrogation was very difficult.
Greenland, also known as the Little Sleeping Head, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean around Greenland and Iceland, reaching a height of 4 to 5 meters as an adult.
But they grow extremely slowly, sometimes only about a centimeter a year, suggesting that Greenland may have a remarkably long life span.
Traditional methods of dating usually use animal tissue, some fish can use spines, but this tissue is very rare in Greenland.
A new study led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, instead used the crystalline lens of Greenland to measure radioactive carbon dioxide.
This method has previously been used to determine the age of fish, but it is the first time that the age of fish such as fish has been used to determine the age of fish.
Their analysis shows that the largest life span of this fish is estimated to be 392 years, with a mismatch of 120 years.
That is, the age of this shark is at least 272 years, with a maximum probability of reaching 512 years.
In addition, the female Greenlander is said to reach sexual maturity at about 4 meters in height, and is at least 156 years old when she reaches adulthood.
The researchers therefore wrote in their paper that Greenland is the longest known vertebrate on Earth, surpassing the previous longevity champion, the longest-living vertebrate, at 211 years old.
Over the past year, the exchange rate has changed significantly, the exchange rate of the yuan has remained fundamentally stable, while also laying the foundation for the promotion of the internationalisation of the yuan.
From a market performance perspective, over the past year, the RMB exchange rate has shown a marked double-digit fluctuation, increased exchange rate flexibility, and the overall expected exchange rate stability.
The currency has fluctuated upwards and downwards over a hundred points in the middle price of the dollar, but the process has been upward and downward.
The last exchange rate change before the exchange rate last year was implemented in 2005, when the yuan rose significantly against the dollar over a decade.
Since the new currency change was implemented, the yuan has changed its previous upward trend, with the average value of the yuan's exchange rate over the course of a year being about 8%.
On October 1 of this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially adopt the yuan, becoming the SDR (special withdrawal rights) weighted currency.
This week, statistics released by the General Customs Administration of China show that for the first seven months of this year, China's total imports and exports amounted to 13.21 trillion yuan, down 3% from the same period last year.
In July, China's total imports and exports decreased by just 0.9%, especially the exports, which grew by 2.9% in comparison.
 Experts believe that although there are signs of stable imports and exports in July, there should be no excess expectations.
In July, China's total imports and exports amounted to 2.09 trillion yuan, down 0.9% compared to the previous year.
Of these, exports amounted to 1.222 trillion yuan, an increase of 2.9%; imports amounted to 873 billion yuan, a decrease of 5.7%; trade surplus amounted to 34.28 billion yuan, an increase of 34%.
Although the total value of imports and exports has continued to decline, export data have shown growth, which is also the fifth consecutive monthly growth in exports since March this year.

According to China's Voice of China, Japanese Prime Minister Abe Jinsun-san will travel to Kenya in late August to attend the sixth Africa Development Conference.
The Africa Development Conference is led by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, so this will also be the first ever transition to Africa.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said that a conference held locally in Africa helped to draw attention to Japan in African and European countries.
In order to support Abe's visit, the JPS will send delegations of MPs to the relevant countries.
Japan's entry into the world of sustainable development began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference initiated by Japan also began in 1993, so it's no coincidence!
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations, is an important UN treasury, Japan wants to get into the regular, how can it give up Africa?
We will also exchange views with relevant stakeholders from countries on the extremist group Islamic State and its countermeasures to terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau and others.
Japanese Foreign Minister Shikida Wenzhyo has also recently expressed his intention to hold this Africa Development Conference at the United Nations Security Council.
Abe had announced that, in order to stabilize the sub-Saharan African country, he would provide assistance of 100 billion yen over five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity toward Africa has had two main purposes: to increase Japan's presence in Africa; and to win the support of African countries on the issue of accession.
According to Japan expert 伯江 analyst, politically, Africa, although relatively lagging behind in development, but with a relatively large number of countries, so Japan has always considered it as the so-called大票田.
From now on, Japan will not give up, nor will the work for Africa stop there, but will continue to strengthen.
 Economically, due to Japan's relatively strong production capacity, but relatively limited domestic market, especially in the current context of the aging of the poor, domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from the rise of the Shōzō Tenshin Shiro 10 years ago to the rise of the Shinzo Abe 10 years later, Japan's many attempts to invade Japan have been unsuccessful.
Japanese expert on Japanese affairs, Berjiang, believes that Japan's entry into the commonwealth is obvious, but the path to it is bound to be difficult and difficult.
To achieve its goals, Japan must first establish good relations with its neighbors, where, whether in geopolitical disputes or national disputes and historical knowledge, Japan needs to have the right attitude.

Traditional customs are introduced to a new highlight2016兰zh文化节香港维园开幕

A couple from France stayed at the event for almost three hours, and experienced the movement in the mini-cardroom.
 I looked up this special holiday online, so I decided to come and see it, feel it fresh
They said that although France has similar festivals to commemorate the pioneers, the atmosphere is heavy, unlike here, there is music, food and you can learn traditional craftsmanship.
She said, In Hong Kong, the busy financial capital, one can also see such a large, organized ritual of ancestor worship
 This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to learn and pass on these traditional techniques.
President of the event, Chi Chihuahua Zhenhua, said, "We do not want to make the Zhenlan Cultural Festival too scary, so that people dare not approach it, especially young children".
 We hope that through youthful activities and arrangements on the ground, young people will know that the culture behind the zhlan节 is about showing kindness and gratitude

Marissa Hymniss Kaczho, who had watched the performance of the Beijing Drama 15 years ago, was accompanied by her daughter after the performance.
 It was a perfectly fine performance, music, lighting, stage performances all impressed me,...... I felt it necessary to let my daughter also learn about Chinese culture and Chinese theater arts.zh
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience impressed the white-daughter actress, young actress, and model, Laila Canizh.
I didn't think the Mexican audience was so enthusiastic, I was still a little worried about whether they would understand the story, but today seeing that they could capture the plot and many laughs, I was expecting it.

During his 14-year athletic career, he won a total of 18 world championships, becoming the first Chinese athlete in Olympic history to win four Olympic gold medals.
She has held the world No. 1 ranking for eight consecutive years, and is the longest-serving female athlete in the history of table tennis.
On September 26, 2010, he was appointed Deputy Secretary General of the People's Daily and General Manager of the People's Search Network Shares Company, a member of the House of Representatives.
A few days ago, she will work with Zhongming Hong to create the country's first sports industry innovation platform.
There is also a group of star coaches on the Chinese body: they have the unlimited flair of the athletic era, won countless national honours; after retirement, they pass on their years of learning to later generations, cultivating a championship among them.
As China's first world champion in men's gymnastics, Huangzhong chose to take up teaching after retiring.
From coach of the women's team to coach of the men's team, and then to head coach, Huang Yue has built an Olympic gold team, leading the team to a legendary 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 bronze finish at the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Tan Liang has been a constant publicist, and in recent years has played important roles such as Zheng Zhong, Zheng Zhen, and Zhao Li.
Many NBA players have proven their strengths, but some progress and others fail.
Whether it's due to age or limited playing time, some players' performances will decline each season.
Of course, some of the steps may be merely a shrinking of data, the strength of these players may not have decreased.
Even though Wade is still one of the best point guards in the league, his performance at Bulls shouldn't be as hot as it is.
He and Londo's backfield range is limited, and the three-point shooting rate of the star Butler is only 32.8%, making their offensive play next season very crowded.
Coming to Windsor, Lightningman will most likely give the ball to Butler and Londo, who will most likely choose to play in the regular season.
Okafor's situation is somewhat embarrassing, as the 76ers' first pick last season, he had to compete with Simmons and Enfield in the new season to get the time and the ball.
The competition may not come soon, Simmons needs to adapt to the NBA playoffs, Enfield needs to fully recover from his injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can be positioned in the 76ers' senior squad is a matter of debate.
Last season, Okafor scored 32% of his points from low-level offense, a proportion higher than Cousin, Vučević and Brooke Lopez, while his utilization rate was also high, ranking in the top 40 of the league.
With Simmons already demonstrating excellent control of the ball, Enfield also has a more suitable NBA player character, and Okafor's position is hardly ever going to be that stable again.
Over the past two seasons, Thompson's utilization rate has stabilized in the league's top 20, which is also the best two seasons of his career.
The problem, however, is that with Durant's arrival, Thompson's employment rate will inevitably decline, which will inevitably affect his performance.
This effect will not only affect the number of starts, but the defensive offense of God's hand will certainly be greatly reduced next season, which in some respects will also reduce the opponent's defensive difficulty against him.
Durant's arrival will certainly cause the Warriors to shrink, but the biggest shrinkage of all is probably Thompson.
But that doesn't mean that God's level is retreating, rather that he has made sacrifices for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his basketball efficiency reached a career high, but because of his and Aldrich's chemical reactions, the Spurs benefited.
When Ken retired, Genoa declared a new war for a year, and the GDP portfolio finally came to an end, as one of the youngest of the three, the tank of a French sports car was running low.
After earning his third overall ring, only Jabal, Jordan and Raselby James have won more regular season MVPs, while Jordan is the only FMVP to beat James Stowe.
James just brought Cleveland its first professional sports championship trophy in 52 years.
James, who is entering his 14th season as a professional, needs better assurance of physical strength, preparing for the playoffs.
So, in the regular season, James's data is likely to decline further, he will assign more burdens to Owen, but he will still easily be in the top three in the league.
It is imperative that the skills learned from domestic learning be promoted in Russia.
On 12th local time, President of the Moscow-Washington-Chinese Federation Huang Shih spoke with excitement when he saw a Chinese news anchor.
Recently, she attended a training course in Chinese literature (literature, painting) conducted by the Chinese State Council's Office of Foreign Affairs at the University of Zhengzhou.
When I first attended a training session, I had no idea where to start with bookmaking, so after the training, I was able to draw and write my own work.
Once he himself returns to Moscow, he must use the knowledge and skills he has learned to contribute to the spread and spread of Chinese culture.
The Secretary General of the Russian-Chinese Cultural Association, Nan Yengwei, who also attended the training, felt the same way.
She said she made great progress with the help of her classroom teachers, but also felt responsible for being a Chinese culture overseas communicator.
Yanzhwei said that after returning to Russia, he was determined to spread and promote traditional Chinese culture among Chinese and Chinese-loving Russians.

England won the silver medal in the men's sevens rugby sevens competition, Fiji won the gold medal.
In the final of the seven-man rugby sevens on Thursday night, the British team failed to extend their excellent performance before being beaten 43-7 at the Riotorio Stadium by Fiji.
Fiji won the gold medal for their unbeatable performance in ball control, stealing, dodging, cooperating, running and strength, which was the country's first ever Olympic medal.
The silver medal was also a minor consolation for the defeated British team, which was the third silver medal won by the British delegation that day.This was enough to make the British rugby team proud: they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on their way to their first Olympic Games in seven-man rugby.
Earlier in the day, England beat South Africa 7-5 in a draw, which may have affected their final status.
But in any case, the Fijians are now enough to beat a spirited 15-man squad.
Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the English team, but it may not be.This Englishman is Ben Ryan, the head coach of the Fiji team from Wimbledon, who was also the head coach of the England team.
The British team's achievements today are not easy to achieve.
Eight years ago, under the coaching of Ryan, they were unsuccessful in the Adelaide International Seven-man Rugby Championship.
And now, they are just one step away from the championship.
Although they were hit hard, they also made remarkable progress.
Fiji took the lead in the opening game, leaving the British team without any recruiting power.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammate, it's like hitting a train that's on the move.When Ossi Coriniso rushes into the Horned Frogs, the World Series champion team is already 5-0 ahead.
Just four minutes into the game, Jerry Touzhway scored again with a right-handed touch.
12-0 against England, the English team barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's strong blockade of the Giants left the giant Leon Nacarawa without a third goal, but this only slowed Fiji's score.
At 7 minutes, Asa Weidlimaru touched the ground in the right corner (17-0), leading the British team to the snow.
Nazara Karava scored another point, with one minute left in the first half of the game.
Then, Watmozh Lavoovo broke through the defence of the English team, straight to the goal line.
At halftime, the score was already 29 to 0.
The Fijians are like born to play seven-man rugby, while the British team is still the first to emerge.
That's the way things are.
The British made a huge change in the second half and were already good at their first half, hitting the Fijians' defensive line for a full four minutes, but the Fijians then played a great match, scored again by Joshua Tuesova.
Dan Norton created a scoring opportunity for the England team, he touched the left corner, changing the score to 36 to 7, but the game was already under the control of the South Sea island nation, with their fans singing loudly, waving flags, carrying a song and dancing on the platform.
The excellent performance of Fiji's team is a force to be reckoned with.
Mata William stopped the Fijians at the last minute of a minor offense.
The end whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the defeated British team could only regret retreating.
Earlier that day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, while England beat South Africa in a fierce semi-final match.
In the first half, Kyle Brown helped South Africa take the lead, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with an excellent foot-break.
Afterwards, the brother of England's Anthony Marcus Watson, with a brilliant interception, secured the team's victory, eventually winning the silver medal.
Helen Graz and Heather Stanning, encouraged by their coaches who had cancer, won the gold medal in the yacht race.
Without exaggeration, this is the most moving piece of gold.
From the first time they drew to date, Helen Graz and Heather Stanning have been trained 220 times in punitive drawing, and their win at the Estacio da Lagoa has even greater significance.
Although only the two of them did, the voice of a man on board, coach Robin Williams, has been accompanying them to their second consecutive women's Olympic gold medal in doubles, the first British women's combination to reach this height.
They have maintained a 39-game undefeated record, with an absolute advantage.
What we see is that these two talented athletes are gracefully advancing on the water, but that's not all of this victory.
Behind every gold medal is a lot of volunteer help, and it is their constant dedication that makes the difference, and the biggest help is not just a person who learned about cancer 30 months ago, not knowing if he would ever see the coach alive.
As he said, death could come at any time.
I had bladder cancer, and they operated on me.
If not operated on, cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
This way, things will get much worse.
This will slightly change your mind.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he began treatment in early 2014, and the effect will be minimal, although in this case it may not be appropriate to say so.
I need to get paid, so I have to get better quickly.
This is an inspiration to me.
I live in a hospital, and although they say walking a few steps is enough, I still walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet around the hospital every time.
This is the beginning of everything.
Boating is itself a journey, which makes it a little longer.
The moment they took the gold, their first thought came to Williams.This morning, Williams was talking a little more than usual, in order to overcome his anxiety.
After Stanning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Squadron, travelled to Afghanistan, she said: "I'm in a bad mood this week, maybe a little extreme, but the value of this gold medal is extraordinary".
It repeatedly told me how important this was to me, how much effort Helen, Robin and I had put in.
This is the reward for three years of hard work that Helen, Robin and I have put in.
Without Robin, we would be just a little unknown, thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a better coach and trainer than him.
Helen Graz and Heather Stanning have not been unbeaten in five years.
The punitive strength of this combination set for the pair is unmatched by their opponents.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Graz still had a large body energy reserve.
It was a real shock at the time.
Helen cried out: "Keep your pace, keep your pace".
It is indeed very important not to be influenced by an opponent.
We had a good start, but we didn't expect to do anything dramatic.
We didn't think about today's glory, we just thought about making every move and winning this race, and we did.
The couple spent a year deciding their future together.
Next month, she will be married to TV explorer Steve Baxhar.
But right now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say this is my last match.
This would put me under too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It's a whole new experience, and I'm feeling very nervous.
It's been about four minutes now.
She said that I feel better.

Snapchat's effects have been criticized for being Asian.
Snapchat said the lens was inspired by the anime, but some observers believe it is racially colored.
Snapchat's 150 million daily users can use its filtering tool to change reality and make images funny and funny.
You can turn yourself into a shark, a dog, or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
These lenses have a curved effect, producing more than 30 million modified selfie shots a day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for being a black-eyed app or a white-skinned beauty.
So, when the app offered some users a lens that could create slanted, weird, and pink eye effects this week, some critics called it a racial slur for Asian people.
They even consider whether these recurring problems mean that the company has a greater problem with diversity.
After Snapchat announced it was removing the feature, reports from The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday sparked outrage.
The company's explanation is this: The lens is a tribute to the characters in the anime, not to the Asian characters.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminds them of a harmful stereotype in reality.
Others are also firmly opposed to these cartoons.
One of the South Korean-American art students who tweeted about the photos and was widely shared said in an email that the lenses were at least unpleasant and uncomfortable.
She also said: "It is difficult to distinguish the extreme depravity of the Asian stereotype from the effect of the stereo".
Although not only the yellow people in the mirror, the yellow people are extremely low.
Snapchat isn't the only company that touches on these cultural underpinnings.
From the board of directors to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have always been a proponent of diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat's large youth population may be highly sensitive because of racial diversity more than older people.
When a Snapchat lens produced an image of an insulting user, 25-year-old Zhuketi said in an interview on Thursday: "These kinds of things are harder to get out of the public eye than before.
On Thursday, Ms. Ju, who was a product manager and engineer at Medizhum, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article she wrote for Mediumzh and a telephone interview, she stated that she felt that racial controversy reflected Snapchat's lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's employees as mostly white, the leadership as entirely male, and added a tag at the end of the article:#DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Zhu said: "Either their employees are not of any race, so they can make such a decision, or their employees are of some race, but their position does not allow them to say what they want".
Other observers shared complaints that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company did not release data on employee diversity, and has declared itself a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its employees, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter who was specifically responsible for focusing on the lower-income population and promoting internal inclusion.
Ms. Zhu said she will close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us to oppose this behavior".
The congressional panel said military officials had distorted ISIS intelligence.
A congressional panel released a report Thursday that officials at the U.S. Central Command had modified the intelligence report to describe the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it actually was.
This midterm report comes from a special task force composed of the chairman of the Republican National Committee of the House Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the House Appropriations Committee.The report says that intelligence analysts at Central Command have a broad dissatisfaction with the report, which says senior officials are changing their assessment of the U.S.-Islamic State war.
Central Command (Centcom) in Tampa, Florida is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a press release about the report, intelligence reviewed by senior Central Command leaders is more optimistic about the U.S. counterterrorism response than the facts, and it is always more optimistic than other intelligence agencies' analysis.
A California Republican representative said: "The behavior of Central Command is not acceptable. On the one hand, our soldiers have suffered war, and on the other hand, senior policymakers have received the wrong analysis".
The leadership problem of the Central Command has been extended to the highest levels of the institution.
The report details the long-standing problems facing the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing U.S. training of Iraqi troops.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the changes to the reports, according to the report's description, the analysts felt they were under pressure from the Central Command leadership, forcing them to make more optimistic comments about the threat posed by Islamic State (ISIS or ISIS).
The report notes that in the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command's press releases, statements and congressional testimony were far more optimistic than the actual situation.
For example, an official at the Central Command publicly stated that a major military operation could be launched to retake Mosul as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas said in a statement: "After months of investigation, the results are clear.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the senior intelligence officials at the US Central Command controlled the command's intelligence products, hiding the threat from Islamic State in Iraq.
After learning from analysts that intelligence on Islamic State had been manipulated, the Republican Party formed a special task force.
As the investigation continues, more findings will be made after the report, which was released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
A Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee announced Thursday the results of its investigation, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
The Democratic leader of the committee, Shezhanda, said in a statement: "Between 2014 and 2015, Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessment of Islamic State and Iraqi security forces.
Mr. Sheanda said that this process impeded the release of intelligence, lowered the morale of analysts and prevented them from accepting different opinions.
But Mr. Sheaanda and the Democrats also said they found no evidence to support the palace's attempts to pressure the Central Command analysts, thus bringing their conclusions into line with a political narrative.
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported that after receiving complaints from the Central Command division of the division, the Pentagon's attorney general began investigating the case.
Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense had not commented on the congressional report until the attorney general's investigation was completed.
But he said: "Experts sometimes have differences in interpreting complex data, while intelligence agencies and the Defense Ministry encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security topics".
The impact of this investigation has far surpassed the question of whether U.S.-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria have been successful (according to increasing numbers of Defense Ministry officials).
But last year, these claims raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can trust the Central Command's assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of the controversy over a decade ago, when Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hook wrote a research paper, noting that despite opposition from numerous analysts, the George W. Bush administration insisted on sending small-scale troops to Iraq and barely considered the situation after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook played a key role in this campaign against the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hook's team concluded that airstrikes on the Islamic State refinery did not significantly reduce the economic income of the terrorist group, as the terrorist group built temporary refineries to continue selling oil on the black market, contrary to the statement made publicly.
According to a September report in the weekly Times, Central Command did not publish the findings to the outside world.
After several lawyers reviewed Senate testimony regarding the over-optimistic assessment of the war, Central Command Command Commander Lloyd Osborne III was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April, and is currently replaced by Joseph Water, who is in his position at Central Command.
The United States has won four straight women's hockey games, and will face England in the final.
Katie Bamm, a three-time All-American in a 6-1 win over Japan, led the American women's hockey team for the second time on Thursday, helping the U.S. team beat the Indians 3-0.
Five goals in two games were four of them, but Bam, 27, said she had no idea she had such a great performance.
She said: "I don't know anything about this.
I'm not the kind of person who remembers having hit a few balls.
She only knew that the U.S. team had won four straight Olympic Games and would be vying for first place in the group with the British team, who had not won since defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States faced each other in the final match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams will play in the quarter-finals of the group stage, which will decide who will appear as group one.
The team that scored first in the group will avoid meeting the strong Dutch team, thus being able to go further.
In Saturday's game, the U.S. team performed a marvel with an amazing performance. At the London Olympics four years ago, the U.S. team finished last out of 12 teams.
Bamzh was also in the squad at the time.
Bam, who grew up in Bruebell, Pennsylvania, picked up a hockey stick for the first time at age three (her twin sister practiced the sport in Drexel) and joined the national team at age 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
Failing to make the final roster, she missed the 2008 Olympics.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not treated well.
The next year, with Englishman Craig Panam as head coach, everything started to change.
Bam said: This is a cultural, mental and material change
We were not yet at the current level in London at the time.
We have come to a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam took the lead in the first half with a close-up shot at the opponent's goal.
India have yet to taste the results of the competition, but the team has shown remarkable hard work and maintained a 1-0 lead until the end of the third quarter, when the boom is coming.
She ran the ball along the left side of the field, then cut into the middle, pulled the net, and led the American team 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez shot the final goal in the fourth quarter midway through the fourth quarter.
The United States, who were the first ever zero-sum opponents in this tournament, beat goalkeeper Jackie Bridges in each of their first three wins.
This time she was super-normal.
Bamzh also.
Panam said: "We are in a good position at the moment, but how much better will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game".
The cold acidic food of the Great Depression.
In March 1933, newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt was sitting down to lunch in the presidential office.
As a culinary man, President Roosevelt enjoyed Fifth Avenue cuisine, such as liver and Maryland seafood.
On that day, his menu was very simple: tomatoes, devil's eggs, potatoes, and fruit pudding as a snack.
Jane Zigman said: "It's about sharing pain with those who are suffering from food.
Her husband Andrew Kozh added: "This also reflects the American diet.
This couple, who live in the Brooklyn Heights, are both food historians.
Mr. Ko's previous book, The Meal, was about American Chinese cuisine, while Mrs. Ziegman, in her book Fruit Garden, told the life stories of slum tenants through food.
Their new book, co-authored with Harper's, will be published Tuesday by Harper's, which will cover the history of food in the United States during the Great Depression.
After presenting some common food insights, they met a reporter at a sandwich shop in Eisenberg.This simple dining counter in the Zhou district has been in business since 1929 when the economy was booming.
Ms. Zigman, 54, made a cream cheese with a slice of olive sandwich, while Mr. Ko, 57, made a broth, potato mud and vegetable jelly.
The reporter pointed to a portion of the meat, which the couple thought was appropriate for discussing the diet during the Great Depression.
Mrs. Zigman said: "Bread was very popular at the time.
At that time there was peanut bread, liver bread, soy bread.
They are both made from a raw material and a cheap raw material that can be used on the raw material.
Imagine that your dinner is made up of peanuts.
Mr. Ko has played a strange figure.
He said: They are definitely in your stomach likezh.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, American Dontons were all-you-can-eat, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooked, breakfasted, lunched and dined a newly invented pie for male farm workers.
During World War I, it was the Americans who delivered food to hungry Europeans.The book documented how this country suddenly ceased to be a prosperous country.
Mr. Ko explained why he and his wife wrote this book: "At the time, food had become a major issue that made Americans uncomfortable".
Another unpleasant topic is the fresh foods of the cold acid: the delicious foods of bread and vegetables have become main dishes, and the best way to make leftovers, says Ms. Ziegman, is because chefs can use the cream in the feed to mask the unpleasant ingredients.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheaper cranberries.
Meat, which has been the staple of American dining tables for years, has become a rare luxury item.
Strangely enough, the big picture only concerns calories, rather than taste, or even basic common sense, where people think about nutrition first.
During the course of researching the book, including various recipes, Ms. Zigman prepared a roasted onion filled with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said: "This is not common at dinner tables.
Ms. Zigman said: "It's too strange.
Peanut butter and roasted onions are not exactly a good combination.
This is a feature of many family-friendly meals.
Family economists have influenced the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as the head chef of the Federal Home Economics Agency from 1923 to 1943, and others, which is unprecedented in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encourage women to be careful and courageous in turning bad foods like cream pasta and carrots into delicacies.
The richness of the great meal is a richness of the richness of the historical gems.
Particularly interesting is the government's uncontrollable response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover and others.
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse he had as a child, his diet was as refined as that of a millionaire.
Mr. Ko said: "He likes to eat European Western meals, such as fish with cucumbers".
He was wearing a nightgown, dining in a gold restaurant.
He clearly broke away from the people.
If it hadn't been for his wife, Eleanor, who encouraged him to set an example in dieting, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book says, the housekeeper employed by Mrs. Roosevelt was not interested in taste, so the food in the White House was not only the hardest food in Washington, but also the worst.
When the United States returned to normal, many of the Great Depression-era practices were abandoned.
Ms. Zigman said that all we have left is our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to the environment.
The couple said that while writing the book, they learned more about Ms. Ziegman's mother's eating habits, such as how she did not throw away food.
Mr. Kozh said: "She is very afraid of wasting food.
Ms. Zigman recalled: "She actually caused many people to get sick".
For example, there was once a cream bubble incident.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Ko took out a dessert they had prepared at home: this was the fruit pudding President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
Ms. Zigman said: "It's called a cream cheese, and adding that a new trend in the name of a regular dish is a common practice".
This dessert has no cream, only fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and meat.
Everyone is hard pressed to fit in the sticky brown glue.
Surprisingly, the sweetness of this dessert is still good.
Mr. Kozhokye ate another second spoon, a third spoon.
He felt that this was an acceptable, convenient dessert, and told his wife: "Then add a little crushed walnut and it will be better to eat it".
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, while Saudi production hit new highs.
This report does not prohibit the market from casting doubt on the credibility of OPEC, and the road to recovery in oil prices may still be paved with thorns.
On Monday, OPEC President and Qatar's Energy Minister Sadat said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
The monthly report of OPEC published on Wednesday showed that the entire OPEC organization, including Gazh, increased production in July by 460,000 barrels/day, to 33.11 million barrels/day.
OPEC also said in its monthly newspaper that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil products, thus exacerbating the market supply surplus.
The impact of this news, coupled with the US's upward expectations of crude oil production and the unexpected increase in crude oil reserves, has led to the international oil price falling for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday's close, the New York Commodity Exchange's September delivery of crude oil futures fell 2.48%, and the October delivery of London Brent crude oil futures fell 2.07%
Reuters believes that the proposed Congress on Oil Production is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and that data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration also undermines market popularity.
Iran's official news agency Fars quoted Iranian oil minister Zaganin as saying Wednesday that Iran's production of crude oil reached a peak of 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
Just after the news of the summit was announced, Russian Energy Minister Novak said that there was no need for a new round of product negotiations at the current oil price.
The last oil-producing countries' summit was held in April, and OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measures.
Emma Richards, an analyst for BMIResearch Oil and Gas, said that the market and media may be overreacting to OPEC's upcoming meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at the Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC would change market sentiment by releasing signals that they would promote an agreement.
This means that smoke and mirrors that open the human eye will intentionally give the wrong impression.
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at the German Commercial Bank, said that OPEC is considered unlikely to try to stabilize the market through the September meeting.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, which has played a major role in the development of the organization.
The focus of the drawdowns will be on the illegal publication of medical advertisements, complaint reporting centers, and medical institutions that have already been subject to multiple penalties.
The National Health and Medical Research Council, the National Medical Administration of China, will in due course conduct a review of the organization's special surveillance inspection work in some provinces.
According to media reports, the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine has caused serious problems with the current product homogenization, investment momentum has slowed, and capital has entered a period of observation.
According to data from the Hong Kong Elipezh Hospital Management Research Center, Internet healthcare companies have suffered massive deaths in the first year of their existence, and about 20% of the Internet healthcare startups have ceased to exist.
However, even though most internet healthcare companies struggle on the A-Round or B-Round financing path, some of the leading companies in several segments can still get capital gains.
It seems that Internet healthcare startups do not stop at a moment's notice, but instead focus on market demand, focus on expertise, and deep focus.
鱼跃 invested 12 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, and the Kyushu-Teng Equipment Company invested 18 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the support of national policies on medical informatics, the electronicised, integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
This joint venture with Kyushu General is already targeting market demand, helping hospitals build advanced supply chain management systems, and seeks to expand cooperation as an opportunity.
Unlike many internet healthcare companies, which are greedy and ambitious, iBaby has focused on the vertical sphere of internet delivery from the beginning, deeply cultivating both pregnancy and physician care.
Pregnancy is not only available for free 24-hour and one-on-one consultations with the primary care physician, but also for paid directed medical consultations.
On the medical side, iBaby breaks the regional limit by taking the form of micro-lectures, such as organized experts giving online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges, case discussions, and more to primary care physicians.
Currently, the medical community has three panels, namely, for physician continuing education, physician social, and physician assistance.
Provide services including online learning, case-discussion, academic exchange; social platforms with hospitals, family physicians; legal assistance needed in a doctoral relationship or personal life; business support, etc.
According to media reports, CEO Wang recently said Alizh Health was willing to take a deep breath to get big data on health.
Internet companies, data companies lack professionalism, and cannot be unified in the writing method of the same word.
Ali currently has three units in the medical health field: Ali Health, the Tantra Medical Center and the Paypal Future Hospital.
Frankly, a healthcare startup is more difficult than other industries, and it's not just about how much money it has, but also about being depressed, being patient, and slowly doing it.
Watching the Olympics at night is easy to damage the heart.
The Brazilian Olympic Games are held in a fire-filled manner, and even if the broadcast is at midnight domestically, many citizens will watch them at night.
To this end, doctors warn in particular, watching night events poses health risks, potentially causing cardiovascular disease.
If the hormone is released overnight for a long period of time, it will still be highly secreted, the body will remain in a state of nervous excitement, cannot recover normally, is prone to causing blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.
Kwon-ji-yeo especially warns that groups of cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat, smoking habits, family history, and other factors, if left untreated, are more likely to cause cardiovascular disease.
If it is prolonged overnight, not only the cardiovascular function is affected, but also the gastrointestinal function, immune system, and endocrine system, and even the risk of developing a tumor increases.
For an old friend, Hanxi Ji-hyun advises, try not to spend the night watching the Olympics, especially for groups with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the previous World Cup, Han Ji-hye diagnosed a patient in his 60s who had a heart attack or was watching a game at night.
Since this year, its clinic has diagnosed some patients with a heart attack or stroke around the age of 25, largely as a result of the patients' prolonged lifestyle.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union sent missiles to Cuba, almost causing a nuclear war with the United States and the Soviet Union.
This event is seen as the height of the Cold War, which history calls the Cuban Missile Crisis.
But it is little known that, just as during the Cold War, a severe solar storm may have led to the United States launching a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, an event not first reported by researchers to the outside world until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a powerful solar storm caused severe interference with radar and radio communications for the U.S. military at the Arctic.
These radars were part of the US ballistic missile warning system, used to monitor Soviet missiles.
This paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, USA, interviewed US military personnel who were then involved in predicting and analyzing solar activity, and consulted non-confidential literature.
The paper wrote that in the 1960s, to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly waging a nuclear war, the US Air Force always had a portion of nuclear warheads in the air.
The commander of the U.S. military did not know that the culprit in the interference was the solar storm and not the Soviet Union, so he ordered the fighter to enter combat readiness.
Fortunately, the U.S. military, beginning with the late 1950s, and its research into solar activity and electromagnetic interference with Earth, eventually stopped this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the U.S. Air Force Air and Weather Bureau, and submitted a detailed report.
The direct result of this solar storm was that the U.S. military has since considered space weather an operational concern and has established a stronger space weather forecast system.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new edition of the Defense Cooperation Index in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more aggressive role globally.
It was the same day that US Secretary of Defense Carter, US Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Kishih Tenshiwon-shō and Japanese Defense Minister Shōgun-young attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that the Chinese People's Republic has published the Japanese military force assessment report, and the fourth time that the English edition has been released.
Chapter 9 of the report, including the overall policy adjustment, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons equipment, institutional reform planning, military training exercises, military security cooperation with foreign powers, military security relations with China, and more.
The report said that 2015 was the year of the phased harvesting of the Abe government's major policy adjustments in the security sector for several years in a row.
From now on, Japan's security initiatives will be primarily focused on the operational level of law enforcement, strategic implementation, policy implementation, rather than on the substantial adjustment and change of frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report stresses that Abe is trying to break through the above three points, achieving the multiple goals of promoting Japan's "normal statehood", "self-defense" to intervene in international security affairs, "strengthen the alliance" and "defend China".
Previously, the China Strategic Cultural Promotion Council had previously released a report on the evaluation of Japanese military strength on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014, and June 30, 2015.

A black-and-white coalfield warehouse, turned into a football field like a green grass; a red-top factory, turned into a modern sports hall.
On the occasion of the National Fitness Day, South Raima Camp Sports and Culture Park outside the Hangzhou Yangtze Gate, was unveiled to the public.
This once-coalfield, which was abandoned after closing more than a decade ago, left behind a large amount of illegal building and living waste.
After being renovated and turned into a sports and cultural park, which will officially open to the public in November, the city has a free sports venue for its citizens, and has undoubtedly opened up a whole new space for all-female sports.
This certainly reminds of Hangzhou Chenhua University, a Chinese swimming pool and military academy that has floated multiple world championships.
The name of the pool will be constantly generated, vividly interpreted the relationship between athletics and public sports The extensive crowd base provides good conditions for professional athletes to choose from
The level of athletics is closely linked to the fundamentals of all-female athletics, with all-female athletics in some sense dependent on all-female athletics, while all-female athletics is dependent on the terrain conditions.
As of 2015, the per capita area of sports fields in China, although 150 times larger than when the new China was founded, was reportedly still far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued a plan for the general public's fitness program, which will focus on the development of mass sports.
To make up for this shortcut, on the one hand, relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the stadium when planning the city.
On the other hand, public sports stadiums that have been built, including those in schools and other units, should be as open as possible, and as efficient as possible.
Just as the Rio Olympics are currently underway, the excitement for sport has also awakened a sense of participation.
Guild was awarded a lawyer's fee in the patent dispute with Merz's patent for hepatitis C.
According to a judgment of a U.S. District Judge, Gilead Science is entitled to attorney fees arising from a patent lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company, the American Merck Group, for hepatitis C.
In June, after a U.S. judge found that Merck had committed illegal acts, including perjury and other immoral acts, Gilland was denied $200 million in damages for violating two of Merck's patents for the sale of Gilland's best-selling drugs, Sophie Buey and Havoni.
In a lawsuit Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Lambson Freeman said that Guild did not have to bear the costs of the defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs market.
The case dates back to 2013, when Guild and Merck filed a lawsuit against each other, both claiming to be the owners of the laboratory work of Sophie Buey, the active ingredient in Guild's medicines.
U.S.-backed forces announced they had recaptured Manbij from the hands of Islamic State.
A spokesman for the force said Friday that the remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city had all left, and that US-backed forces had taken full control of the northern city of Mambi, near the Turkish border.
After the militants had gone into hiding in the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now carrying out a sweep of the entire city.
Shalon Darwish, of the Manbij Military Committee of the Syrian Democratic Forces Alliance, told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians abducted by militants.
He told Reuters: "The Manbij season is now entirely under our control, but we are still carrying out sweeping operations.
The Clinton and Zhou earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% of federal taxes.
Hillary Clinton released her 2105 tax return on Friday, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clinton couple's charitable donations totaled $1 million, most of which went to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech fee was nearly $53.3 million, and the former Secretary of State earned $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster from a book about her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton's campaign partner, Virginia Senator Tim Cain, and his wife, Anne Holton, have filed a 10-year tax return.
Both men paid 20.3% of federal taxes in 2015.
Clinton's campaign assistant, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement: "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane will continue to be the benchmark for financial transparency".
In stark contrast, Donald Trump has been using false grounds to cover up and recant his previously made promise to declare tax returns.
Although there is no requirement under law, as is customary, U.S. presidential candidates must make their tax returns public.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his attorney used the audit of the IRS as a reason for refusing to file a tax return.
Clinton's campaign aide, Ian Samms, tweeted that you were the boss, and attached a link to the Democratic nominee's tax return form.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to file a tax return until the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said Trump's refusal to release the tax return panel raised questions about its net worth, charitable contributions, business transactions and various other relationships, including ties to Russia.
Clinton took this issue to heart, posting a video online on Friday, high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his tax status.
On Thursday, she raised the question in a Michigan economic policy speech.
She told the crowd: "For decades, he has refused to file his tax return, as have other presidential candidates.
According to reports from the 政客新闻网, Trump paid almost no penny of tax in the 1990s for two years, The New York Times Business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, who said the current situation may still be the same.
Federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named a provision after Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor who guaranteed that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Obama also endorsed the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway is headquartered, and Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also undergoing an audit by the IRS, and Trump's fear was not the tax authorities, but voters.
The earliest filing of taxes by the Clinton campaign group was for 2007.
The Clinton couple, who currently reside in Chaparral, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014, and a combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 tax filings of the Clinton couple showed that, unlike most Americans, they earned less than $100.00 in salary.
Their main investment is the low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clinton and Zoning Dividends and Interest Income is $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticized the Berlin Hotel for removing the Israeli telephone code at the request of Arab customers.
A French filmmaker of Jewish descent told the media that the Cabinsky Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli phone number, and the hotel staff said it was in accordance with the requirements of Arab customers, prompting a debate.
Claude Lantzman, author of the documentary Jewish Holocaust, expressed his disappointment with the Kebbinski Hotel and published an open letter in the Frankfurt Report.
During his recent stay, Longzman wanted to find Israel on the phone code list provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can make a direct call from the room.
Did Israel really disappear from Berlin, the capital of Germany, in 2016?
Longman wrote that he was a "good man".
Instead, guests can make Israeli phone calls through the call center at the Kevinski Hotel.
In an attempt to find an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
In a letter, Longzman said he was shocked by the response he received from the front desk.
According to hotel staff, this was a deliberate decision by the management of the Kevinski Hotel.
The reason for doing so was to anger the filmmaker.
Longzman quotes the employee as saying: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand that the code of Israel be removed".
According to reports in the German daily, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadassh Handelsman, called the incident a "strange shame".
When we learned of this incident, we were shocked.
This in itself is a great shame.
What happened in Germany and that hotel chain is even more damaging.
This does not require any explanation.
"We hope the hotel can draw the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some people think that the Cabinsky Hotel simply bowed down to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post pointed directly to the hotel, and pointed out that this street, located on the famous Kudam Street, is near a Jewish synagogue.
According to a report in the Mirror Weekly, the hotel quickly clarified all the allegations, claiming that everything was neglected and apologizing to Longman.
The South German daily quoted a representative of the Cabinsky representative as saying: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the list of rapid dialling countries".
The paper also said that the code of Israel had been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rocket-propelled grenades to drive out Brazilian students protesting.
On Thursday, in São Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police during a protest against government reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rocket-propelled grenades to drive out protesters.
The incident was triggered by law enforcement officials trying to disperse students, so police used rounds and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the march, expressing their dissatisfaction with these programs.
To save money, Governor Okmin of São Paulo plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred to school.
Some students who took part in the protest displayed murals to express their displeasure with the interim president, Michel Temer.
Just days before the latest protest, protesters took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the state Senate.
Scottish cyclist Carm Skinner won the gold medal after his success with the bike.
Scottish cyclist Carm Skinner helped the British trio successfully defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics in the men's team competition at the Rio cycling stadium last night.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist, who replaced his Scottish compatriot Sir Chris Hoey, became a centre-forward for the team. When young Skinner defeated and won the title of New Zealand's top-flight, even the legendary cyclist was proud of him.
Four years ago, the British team was a surprise, while Hoey won the fifth of six individual Olympic gold medals.
With the British team ranking sixth at the World Cycling Championships in London in March, Hoey retired from the sport.
Between the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics, the problem with the British team was that they replaced first-round specialist Jamie Staff.
The team did just that when Sindh showed up.
Hoey's retirement also left a gap, and both Chin Imadi and Matt Clanton wanted to fill that gap.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the England men's team coaching staff insisted on getting him selected for the national team, and Skinner eventually lost the spotlight.
Skinner's partners were Sindh and Kenny, who won gold with Hoye four years ago.These three set Olympic records in qualifying, but were beaten by New Zealand in the first round.
The three British cyclists eventually beat their opponents to win the gold medal.
Although Sindags was slightly behind, Kenny took the lead for the team, and Skinner retained that lead until the end.
A change in strategy was key to this reversal, with Sindh choosing a larger aircraft, so slower, which allowed Kenny, especially Skinner, to maintain speed.
Hoey watched the match as a BBC commentator.Skinna, Kenny and Sindes saw him as he climbed the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old cyclist from Glasgow, said: "It's a shock to me.
I just did my best to make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champion.
This is so incredible.
There is nothing better than this victory.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Howie at the 2012 London Olympics, Sindes admitted to deliberately falling onto the track after a poor start.
He later retracted the comment, and the English team's opponents could not appeal.
And this victory has no such problems.
Sinds said: "It's like London, with the British flag on the station.
We just teamed up three months ago.
We've already lost many world championships, so it's a surprise to be able to defend the Olympic title.
This is just one game, one gold medal for the British team, which won seven of the 10 gold medals in cycling at the Beijing and London Olympics.
If this is a sign of progress we have made in the past five months, then we will continue to have success in the bike yard for the next five days.
Based on the state of affairs Kenny has shown, he is not unlikely to repeat Hoai's feat of winning three gold medals at one Olympics.
If so, then Kenny, who is 12 years old and was born on March 23 (the day seems to be a holy day in British sports, Steve Redgrave, Moffara and Roger Bannister were also born on this day), will have 6 gold medals and 1 silver.
This score is on par with Hoizh.
Kenny will next fight off the three-day race that starts today.
The 28-year-old Boltoner said: "I will be focusing on this game for a while.
Team sports are always the best.
You can win a game with your teammates.
To be honest, one person wins a little loneliness.
Siddes said: "If he can win two more gold medals, he should be awarded the Jack seal.
This was the only medal-winning match of the day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Vikings, Ed Cransey, Steven Burke and Owen Doerr were the fastest to advance to the four-man four-kilometer group chase.
Their score was 351,943 zh.
The world record for the 2012 London Olympics gold medalist was 351,659 yards.
With the first round and final (10:00:42 p.m.) being played on the second day of the tournament today, Vikings will undoubtedly be the focus of a crowd.
Yesterday, he had a quarrel with a match official ahead of the qualifying match, when the match officials asked him to measure his height.
In the women's group stage that ends tomorrow, Laura Trot, Joanna Roser Sand, Elino Buck and Kate Archibald of Milwaukee advanced to the next round with a new world record of 413,260.
The British team relies on their strong on-field cycling team to take the lead in the mid-Olympic and have won multiple medals.
After demonstrating their absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British cycling team disappointed everyone on their way to Rio.
Many upheavals occurred during the period, including the resignation of Chief Technology Officer Sean Sutton in April for allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of legendary figures such as Howie, Victoria Delton and others.
But the first match of the night at the bike yard was enough to prove the legend that England would once again play a crucial moment in the peak stage.
After a small life comes into this world, parents will be responsible for this life, a responsibility that lies not only in the physical health of the child, but also in the spiritual development, i.e. education.
If you fail in your child's education, even if your career succeeds, you cannot make up for the shortcomings of life, the failure of your family.
When a new life comes, new fathers and mothers need to spend time and energy caring for and educating the child, taking responsibility for him.
And the responsibility, in addition to being a reflection of physical care, health, and well-being, lies in spiritual education, that is, in letting children learn how to be human, how to grow up, how to succeed.
A good family education means that parents need to be constantly with their children, to give them love, patience, and care, but also to teach them civilized speech and behavior, to make them learn better, to improve their intellect.
The growth of a child is influenced by the words of one parent, and the child imitates his or her parents, i.e. the commonly spoken dragon, dragon, mouse, and child.
So parents need to set a good example before their children, regulate their speech, cultivate their own good qualities, all of which can indirectly help the child to shape a good mindset, make him better.
Amy is a smart, beautiful girl.
She is an outgoing, dynamic person, who can relate well to her friends, and who is adaptable to the environment.
But Amy has a small secret: she can't concentrate on her studying, her work, her work for a long time.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time.
Even through decentralized, modular time to study and work, she is basically able to complete tasks and get good grades.
But when the task is heavy, when time is tight, Amy feels a lot of pain and torment.
The individual's resistance to self-exposure and its emotional experience is intended to prevent the individual's self-awareness and self-esteem from being threatened.
Some behavioral psychologists also view resistance to understanding as individual disobedience to their behavior.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise, to let her relax herself by breathing in a relaxed way, to feel that part.
Once she had left her trapped situation, she felt relaxed, regained her freedom.
The 63-year-old gangster Hanmu, who had a falling out with another gangster, Shao-mu, after drinking, eventually stabbed him to death with a knife.
Before the case, Han Mu said, he and the fugitive Shao Muzh lived in a land within the city limits of Huongqing, about 20 meters apart.

Uber entered the Taiwanese market four years ago, and it had a significant impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
According to a report by the Taiwanese Joint Press on August 12, more than a hundred taxis bypassed Taiwan's administrative court to protest, causing severe traffic jams around the area.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Taipei City Drivers' Union, Kyung-gi, said, "Uber is coming to Taiwan four years ago, the Taiwanese authorities have only convened a meeting at the end of this month, the drivers can no longer wait.
However, the government's lack of confidence, dragging and dragging, led to a falling out.
A law-abiding taxi driver who belongs to the lower working class, but who wants to compete with Uber, which is illegal but unrestricted, feels cheated by the authorities.
Original title: Jiangsu Ranch 2000 only by the court seizing the owner of the ranch for selling himself.
After the verdict came into effect, as Li Mu did not automatically fulfill the obligations established in the verdict, Wang Mu made a request to the court for enforcement.

The head of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission noted today that overcapacity of steel is a global problem.
China's recent capacity utilisation rate is higher than the global average, and higher than countries and regions such as the Americas and Europe.
China has taken decisive and effective measures to eliminate excess capacity, and the results are gradually showing.
The head of the party noted that the CPSU attaches great importance to the global problem of steel overcapacity.
The various departments and regions are actively implementing the State Department deployment, taking the work seriously, and this year they are aiming to reduce the capacity of rough steel by around 45 million tonnes.
From our country's perspective, China does not encourage steel exports, but instead takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The person in charge emphasizes that international trade in steel products is essentially market behaviour, an independent choice based on factors such as the needs of the importing country, consumer comprehensive consideration of product price, etc.
Implementing trade protection measures will not fundamentally solve the development of the global steel industry, but will only further impact the international trade order.
Speaking of debt, the person in charge emphasized that solving debt problems is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of solving excess capacity.
Because steel companies have large assets and are involved in a wide range of business ventures, some companies have complex debt relationships that, if mismanaged, could pose regional risks.
According to the head of the company, in recent years, as the pressure of the downturn increased, the total demand of society gradually weakened, the capacity utilisation rate in some industries decreased, and the difficulty of producing and operating enterprises increased.
Some companies are not adapting to changing market conditions, production operations are unreliable and even close to bankruptcy, but are constrained by some institutional mechanisms, more barriers to exit the market, and become zombie enterprises.
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces resource efficiency, increases social management costs, and hinders the establishment of a fairly competitive market environment.
The main causes of the losses are the volatile market demand, low capacity utilisation, and the difficulty facing the global steel industry.
China mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic means and the rule of law, the government mainly works to improve the working conditions and social stability, ensure fair and equitable market order.
The head of the company stressed that the next step is to continue to work on the capacity, ensuring the completion of the five-year target of 100-150 million tonnes of raw steel decommissioning capacity.

Police officer Liu Shinezh, who is in her 20s this year, speaks English and Spanish, and she just joined the tourism police force last year.
Along the way, he carefully observed the words of his Russian counterpart, not often communicating with her.
When meeting Spanish tourists to consult with them, the Moscow tourist police patiently explained to each other in fluent Spanish, which impressed King Ice.
Moscow tourist police everyone knows a foreign language, some even have more than two doors, which was a big touch for us
As an international tourist island, Hainan is gradually attaining importance to attracting international tourists, and we want to improve our own capacity to match the status of an international tourist island.
Before the training that day, the Chinese tourist police also went to the Moscow City tourist police station to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
I often interact with Chinese tourists, and I am very happy to see them come to Russia for tourism.
 The questions they usually ask are: how to walk, where is a monument, how to rent, how to get back to the innzh
The commander of the Moscow Metropolitan Police's tourism police force, Sergei Resacov, said that in recent years the urban environment and tourism atmosphere in Moscow have improved, attracting more and more foreign tourists.
To accommodate the needs of tourism development, a tourist police force was established in July 2014, responsible for patrolling the major sights, protecting, assisting and evacuating tourists.
Currently, all Moscow tourist police officers are fluent in English, with some also fluent in Spanish and German.
The police force divides them into nine groups based on their foreign language level, taking classes twice a week, learning self-defense techniques, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
 Currently, two tourist police officers are learning Chinese, already speaking well, and we must continue to improve their Chinese language skills, zh Resakov said.
Resaikov told reporters that the Moscow Tourist Police, since its formation, has accumulated a certain amount of experience, hoping to inspire its three Asian counterparts.
He believes that cooperation between the police departments of the two Russian-Chinese countries will increase the sense of security of tourism between citizens of the two countries.
The recruitment of the personnel of the Moscow tourist police, the police model, the equipment, and the good interaction with tourists have given us a lot of inspiration, Chen Xiaokkun said.
Xinhua news reporter Zhen Li found that at least nine provincial municipalities in Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian, Beijing and other provinces have issued residence permit application rules.
For the conditions for applying for a residence permit, as generally proposed in the above areas, you must reside for more than six months, meet one of the conditions for legal stable employment, legal stable residence, continuing education.
The journalist noted that in terms of the treatment provided by a residence permit, the amount of money available in some areas has been broadened, compared to the provisions of the national version, to the extent of public services and facilities provided in some areas.
These areas have increased the convenience of children taking local high school exams if the relevant conditions are met.
In addition, many places such as Beijing have made clear requirements, gradually expanded the scope of public services and facilities, and regularly made public the public.
For example, Fujian proposes that at least once every three years, the public service and facilities enjoyed by residents of the city be made public to the society.
 The Provisional Regulations on Residence Permits provide that, for those who meet the conditions for the issuance of a residence permit, the public security authority shall produce and issue a residence permit within 15 days of the date of receipt.
 For the issuance deadline, most regions agree with the national version, which is issued within 15 days
 Hebei expressly, for a document fulfilling the requirements of the claim, a complete, documented, and public security posting of residence, must issue a residence permit within three working days of receipt.
According to Jiangxi, the public security authority, which meets the requirements for a residence permit and proves the complete material, must produce and issue a residence permit within five working days of the date of receipt.
In accordance with the Provisional Regulation on Residence Permits, the above areas are clearly defined, the first time a residence permit is applied for, exempt from receipt of documentation fees.
For example, according to the requirements of Sichuan, public security posts or community service agencies in various places must strictly implement approved charging programs and charging standards, strictly prohibiting override, override or charge a car.

Boggba won two yellow medals in the Italian Cup last season, with one automatically banned as per the rules.
Although he has moved back to the Premier League, the FA has still extended its cumulative ban to the Premier League stadium.
In this way, during the August 14th game against Bournemouth in the guest house, Bogba will be a face-off, his return to Manchester United debut will be extended to the 20th against Southampton at home.
As the No. 12 rookie in the 2014 rookie season, Saritz will officially enter the NBA next season, joining the Philadelphia 76ers.
Many fans don't know much about Saritz as a young European player, but through the Olympics, Saritz's performance has left a deep impression on the public.
In the previous game, in which Croatia defeated Spain, Saric successfully sealed off at the last minute the attack under the basket of the extra time attempt by Paul-Gasor to drag the game into extra time.
Recently, 76ers owner Brett-Brown gave Saritz a high rating, who thought he saw Saritz's shadow of the young Manou-Ginobilly.
It is clear that Saridzh has already demonstrated his talent, and has made 76 people look forward to him.
In Croatia's first two games of the Olympics, Saridzh has 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saritz showed his ability to pull in space on the court, by dismantling his teammates, he shot a three-point field goal.
While the current lineup of 76 people has many talented young players, they do not have the outfield abilities of Saridz.
From the goaltender to the power forward to the quick-forward and complete-assist, there are countless in-line players who can do this on the NBA court today.
Since the start of the Olympics, Saritz has scored 13 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists in three straight games, a perfect performance.
Since James decided to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, he has signed two consecutive 1+1 contracts.
As the NBA's current pay agreement enters its final year, as vice president of the NBA Players' Union, James will be at the forefront of negotiating pay agreements.
Given the dramatic increase in league revenue, thanks to the new TV broadcast agreement, and the dispute between the boss and players over how to handle the money, the outside world fears the NBA will be stuck in a deadlock next summer.
But for James, he won't have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer, as he has already signed a three-year contract with the Cavaliers.
Regardless of when the 2017-18 season officially began, James was under contract.
Since the iPhoneSE's surprise debut, the mobile phone market has also been hit by the boom of small screen devices.
Recently, Nubia also launched the first product of its Z11 series: NubiaZ11mini.
The nubiaZ11mini has continued its consistent excellence in photography, and is equipped with a single-handedly easier-to-hold 5.0-inch screen, convenient and easy-to-use back-end fingerprint recognition, achieving its outstanding user experience.
The Z11mini, a small screen camera phone that was just launched under the Nubia flagship, has been reduced in price by 200 yuan, down from its original value of 1499 yuan to 1299 yuan.
In terms of appearance, the NubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen, the front and the bottom of which are still classic red circle designs.
The center frame is metallic, the bottom has been designed symmetrically and configured with a Type-C data interface.
The future of the Portland Zhe refinery is uncertain due to the cancellation of the power supply contract.
Because the power company that supplied the plant with electricity disclosed that a plant owner would terminate a supply contract, rendering all supply contracts invalid, the Portland refinery in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the plant are currently facing an uncertain future.
This move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue granting subsidies to ensure the plant operates.
The 20-year fixed-rate subsidy will expire in November.
The 2,000 workers at the company's Portland plant could face unemployment.
Once the plant is closed, up to 2,000 people may be directly or indirectly unemployed.
And since the power consumption of the plant accounts for about 10% of all electricity output in Victoria, there may also be a chain reaction.
In 2014, the company shut down the Henry-Keng refinery, which led to the closure of the Angers Island power plant last year.
The Portland refinery is currently experiencing losses and is at risk of closing.
The move was made after making predictions about the plant's future years, initially due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, and more recently due to the price of factory products.
AGL supplies electricity to this large refinery through the old Ezh power plant in the Latrobe Valley.The company predicts that the owners of three other plants will also terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholder of the plant is a joint venture between the company and the company, while China's Shinsengzh Group and Japan's丸红股份 also hold a small number of shares.
The joint venture said:AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, meaning that the refinery will continue to generate electricity demand
AGL said the contracts were hedging contracts that should have been in effect from November 2016.
The contract expires at 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
The power company said:zh Therefore,AGL still predicts these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal year 2017.
Any potential revenue impact on AGL from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently under the optimistic outlook of the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the company had already deducted the contract value of $187 million in the forecasted closure period.
The company said the decision to terminate these contracts would not affect the company's ability to operate the refinery or to secure the power supply of the refinery.
The American company said it signed a 20-year contract with the old company in 2010 that was supposed to go into effect in November, but the company did not explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland refinery in Victoria and the Tomaho plant near Newcastle will close due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
Commenting on analysts' comments earlier this week, AGL Chief Operating Officer Stephen Mickelson said Portland's annual electricity consumption was about 600 megawatts, while the Tomaho plant was about 900 megawatts.
If the two plants were shut down, the demand for electricity would be greatly reduced.
He said: "As an electricity company, this is not good news for us.
The Community Law Center annually rejects 160,000 people outside its doors.
Each year, more than 160,000 vulnerable groups are rejected by the community legal center. The funding for this service has been overwhelming, and now they face further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people are denied legal advice and representation when seeking free legal advice, most of whom are elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the resources to fight unjust expulsions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the threshold, and now it faces further funding cuts.
Beginning in June next year, federal funding for these law centers will be reduced by another 30 percent.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, said that according to the latest National Community Association Law Centre Survey Report, thousands of people are rejected outside their doors every year.
Mr. Farrell said that the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change the existing decision.
He said: "The community law centre in Queensland has long been underfunded, meaning thousands of people will not be able to access the essential services they need".
Those who need to stay away from violence, those who bear huge debts that cannot be paid, those facing broken families, oppressed workers, all face legal problems, and the report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by another 30% from June 2017, meaning that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland MP, George Brandeis, to immediately withdraw these cuts so that people can get the help they need when faced with legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Now that the community legal center and its corresponding community needs must be addressed, the White House government must also be involved in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team is being sued for staff shooting.
New York: Trump's campaign team is being sued for failing to act after pointing a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodinizh, former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte.
Bodini said he had hoped the matter could be resolved internally, but after waiting months he realized that this was unlikely.
According to Bodini's description, the head of the operation, named Earl Philip, pulled out a pistol, placed his right thumb on the dashboard, and pointed the gun at Vincent's knee.
After complaining to the leadership of the local and regional campaign teams, Bodini learned from the scroll that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
Bodini said in his complaint: "Not firing a shot does not mean no harm".
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the crowd that if his opponent Hillary Clinton were elected and chose her favorite judge, then those who support the Second Amendment, that is, gun-supporting people and gun lovers, would likely take action.
Trump's campaign team said the media had taken a stand against him, and he did not advocate violence.
Bodini in his complaint demanded that the campaign team compensate for its neglect of supervision, while also demanding that Philip compensate for his assault, beatings and mental harm.
Trump spokesman ZH Hop Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
 cannot contact Philipzh
According to a report by local news agency WCCBzh in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign team.
His consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not immediately respond to his incoming calls.
The campaign team of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is controversial.
Both sides of this case are appealing to the Court of Common Pleas of the McClenburg County (Charlotte) Superior Court, Bodini v. Trump, 16-CS-14300.
Britain must convey the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow airport.
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, London and the entire country.
For me, that is what makes Heathrow so attractive, as at the London 2012 Olympics, we do our best to ensure that our country and region can benefit from these events.
The Olympics have been a great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we will once again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses in the area of Hishro.
For our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and help young people around the airport escape unemployment.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, some people considered the expansion project of Heathrow to be too big.
I was told that Britain would not be able to prepare for the Olympics, and that we would be humiliated in front of the world.
The questioners' doubts about the 2012 Olympics are wrong, and their doubts about the Heathrow project will also be proven wrong.
While there will always be obstacles to overcome, Hishiro is working to solve every problem he faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not the minority.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs, generate 211 billion pounds of economic growth, and leave a wealth of technology and employment for the airport and the whole of the UK.
We have a spending-intensive Heathrow project team, which has completed 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment projects on time and within budget, including T5 which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years and T2 between the world's two busiest runways.
Now, they are preparing to build a third runway with private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The UK successfully hosted the London 2012 Olympics, and I am confident that the Heathrow Airport expansion project will also be a huge success.
Now is the perfect time for us to pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport, so that we can safeguard our future and create a wealth of technology and employment that will make the whole of Britain proud.
Sir Paul Dayton is chairman of the board of Heathrow Airport and a former business lobbyist for the UK Treasury.
A woman committed suicide and was stabbed to death on a Swiss highway.
The victim lay on the highway at midnight.
The woman who attempted suicide was hit by multiple vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning.
The accident occurred early Thursday morning on the A1 motorway near Morzh, Wu State.
According to the Wu State Police, a woman was lying in a desperate state of despair in the middle of the night on the highway and was hit by multiple vehicles.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was clearly suicidal.She was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
The woman died on the spot.
Police have revealed that several drivers involved have been investigated, but some have not yet been confirmed.
Gilles Hofstein's lawyer told the Geneva Forum that a criminal investigation has now begun, as is the usual course of such incidents.
But it is not yet known whether any driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofstede said: "This will be determined by the prosecutor".
Based on the results of two other similar cases in the past five years, the driver will not be held liable.
Both cases were reportedly caused by someone walking on the highway at night, and the final verdict was that the driver could not expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with causing death by negligence, alleging that in August 2014, she hit and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Pajezh.
The court found out that the 22-year-old victim was crossing the road after drinking.
After an investigation, the judge said that the woman officer was driving completely legally at the time, that the man appeared on the road completely by accident and unforeseen circumstances, and that the woman officer called an ambulance after the incident.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near Thursday should call 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 to contact the police 
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable place for humans.
 According to NASA's new climate model predictions, Venus was once suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Institute have developed a model that can explore Venus' past, a model that uses tools and algorithms very similar to those used by climate scientists.
This model is used to determine whether Venus, which has a high surface temperature, no water, and an atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, has ever had an environment similar to Earth.
Previously, scientists believed that Venus rotated slower because of its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have once had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere and a slower rotation rate at the time.
The model can also show the early geography of Venus.
Venus' dry regions may be larger than Earth's, but there was once enough water and geographic changes to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early on, the brightness of the sunlight on Venus was 30% darker than Earth.
Anthony Del Genio, a scientist at the Goddard Space Institute, explained at a press conference: In a model simulation at the Goddard Space Institute, Venus's slow rotation makes daytime on one side of it nearly two months long
This warms the surface and produces rainfall that can form thick clouds, which block most of the sun's heat to the ground like a clot.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature on Venus is actually several degrees lower than that of Earth today.
The Venus evolution simulated by this model is close to what previous planetary scientists had predicted.
Although life may have existed on Venus, over the course of billions of years, Venus was exposed to extreme temperatures and ultraviolet radiation.
The oceans on the planet evaporate, and water vapor is also burned by ultraviolet radiation.
As the hydrogen escapes, only thicker carbon dioxide atmospheres and deadly greenhouse gas emissions remain, forming the planet Venus as we know it today.
Researchers published the results of the simulation of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Communication.
Patrick Rozh resigned as head coach of the Snowshoe team for a while.
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as head coach and vice president of Colorado IceCroach, saying he had no say in team decision-making.
Colorado Executive Vice President and General Manager Josh Sachs confirmed this news and said the club would immediately begin looking for a new head coach.
Roy, 50, said in a statement: "Over the past three years, I have been energetic, passionate and determined to serve as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche.
I thought seriously all summer about how to improve the team, so that it has the power to be higher up.
To do this, the goals of the head coach and vice president must be in line with the goals of the club.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
But at present, these conditions are not yet met.
Sachs hired Roy on May 23, 2013, as a thank-you to Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sachies said: "Patrick told me today about his decision.
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope he will be successful in the future.
Roy was named the best coach in the Jack Adams Award-winning league in his first season as head coach of the Snowmen in 2013-14.
He helped the club score 112 points, ranking first in the midfield area. Colorado was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota, where they have lost the playoffs in each of the past two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the Snowyers finished with a record of 39 wins and 39 losses, ultimately missing out on the second outcard spot in the Western Conference Conference Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups in total, including two each while playing for the Montreal Canadiens and the Snowmen.
Workers of the North Sea oilfields cease their strike and continue negotiations.
The chief negotiator said that workers at the North Sea oilfield had stopped the strike on compensation, and that the parties to the dispute had begun a new round of negotiations.
The North Sea oil platform operated by the Dutch Royal Jardine has been hit by a number of strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group.
 According to a joint statement,zhWood Group, as well as Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the current dispute resolution process
We will begin early next week, and hold several full-day meetings in the coming weeks, to review these issues.
The union said its recent action was to protest the possible 30% pay cut, the first such action in 25 years.
Wood Group has reduced the remuneration of its North Sea contractors by about 9% this year due to market pressure.
Prior to this pay cut, the company reduced the salary of offshore contractors by 10% in 2014.
The company said that a further pay cut would help the company overcome the difficulty of the market crisis.
Shell has laid off thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas facilities in 10 countries, as the company needs to streamline its business after merging with British Energy Group UK.
Energy companies are facing pressure from lower crude oil prices and the UK's June decision to leave the EU.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of the North Sea generation.
He said the North Sea was crucial to the region's economy.
In a statement, Dave said: "In the North Sea and the country as a whole, we need an economy that serves the majority rather than the few".
In 2016, spending on new projects in the North Sea is not expected to exceed $1.4 billion, while the average project spending over the past five years has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measured the rotational speed of the constellation of Zhongshui.
This latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helps astronomers gather the most complete rotational velocity of the constellation Ongzhong.
New data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the constellation have different rotational speeds and the association of rotational cycles with the constellations they make up.
Rosa Rebel, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing Analysis at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said at a press conference: "We want to understand more about the relationship between the mass, age, and even the history of our solar system by comparing our results to other galaxies".
The Ong-Jung constellation is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the constellation were born about 125 million years ago, and are currently just reaching adulthood.
They reach their highest life-cycle spin rates.
When they reach their maximum spin rate, these mature stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the magnetic field of the star, they produce a braking effect on the star.
As the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time of the appearance of identifiable star black holes (such as the solar black hole).
The latest spin velocity datasets show that stars with higher mass spin slower than stars with lower mass.
Rebur compared the stars to dancers, and the speed of the stars when the larger dancers rotated slower than the smaller dancers.
Rebul said: In the performance of the Ballet of the Songzhu constellation, we found that stars that rotate slower tend to have higher mass, while stars that rotate faster tend to be the lightest stars.
Because the AUZ is closer together, it can serve as the ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the mass of stars with the speed of rotation.
Rebur said: "The Zhongshui constellation laid the foundation for the two-way spin theory model of young and old stars.
As to how, when and why stars slow down their rotation and pick up their own dance shoes, we still have much to learn.
Rebur and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the rotational speed of the Aunt Zhou constellation in three new papers, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomy.
The head of the South Lake Park Water Management Department, Zhong Jiang-jun, said that the depth of the South Lake water table is more than 10 meters, and that if the water is not understood, there is a high risk of danger.

The village of Genghe has a unique marine environment, with two major leisure tourist resources, the natural ecology and the human ecology.
 But individual owners of the parishes that bought the parking lot feared that doing so would affect their own parking lot's rental price, and also suspected others were being selfish, so they kept on doing the damage, causing a parking lot renovation to be postponed
The academic community still has a wide range of opinions on when and by whom this question was introduced.
In the current mainstream view, the introduction of the term has three main lines.
Of the three lines introduced by the TZ, the most influential and widespread was the introduction of Chenzhonglong from the Philippines to Fuji.
The Beijing City Office of Social Community Administration will soon conduct a special inspection of the use of the uniform receipts for social group fees.
Check is a unit of self-checking and focused checking.
According to the relevant officials of the municipal community office, the scope of this inspection includes the community groups receiving the uniform fees for the 2013-2015 fiscal year in the municipal community office.
In a 2012 Olympic Broadcasting Strategy, the Rio Olympic Committee stated: "The success of the Olympic Games is determined by who shares their stories on social media".
And from the reporting of this Olympics, the media has made significant changes in many aspects of the way of communication, product form, language style, journalistic perspective, and so on.
The International Olympic Committee and media professionals from around the world seem to have already faced this challenge.
On August 11, the IPO of the Hzh stock entered its final day.Reports indicate that the market reaction to the two days before the IPO was mild.According to plans, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
A domestic brokerage analyst said that Eastern securities were not good on a port-based basis, and its underlying asset management business was the main asset of Eastern securities. Compared to other banking groups such as ZTE, ZTE and ZTE, it appeared to be inadequate.
 Experts note that since this year, as the stock market has receded to a flatter level, many stock market performance have declined, but after the company's listing, it is necessary to look more closely at the development of the company's own business, so that no overview can be made.
With the introduction of this new regulatory regime, Suzhou will become the first city in the country to restart second-tier purchasing restrictions.
Second-tier cities with or soon to have a housing market regulation policy are not only Suzhou, but also cities such as Kowshwe, Nanjing and others.
Previously, Co-operative had been the first to issue a limited lending policy, for home buyers with two apartments under the Co-operative name and one home loan that had not been settled, banks would refuse to offer home loan services.
