Well, I'm going to tell a story about how we know what we know.
The story is about this woman, Natalia Litchinsky.
She's a palaeontologist, and she's specializing in digging up ancient things.
Natalia Litchinsky: "Yes, some call me Dr. "Deathful."
I think she's particularly interesting, because where she digs things, it's in the high Arctic Circle, far away from the Canadian tundra belt.
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at an archaeological excavation site called the practicer's bed, which was less than 10 degrees away from the geomagnetic Arctic.
NR: "Really, it doesn't sound like anything." "You've been carrying a bag all day, with GPS navigation and notebooks," and "always walking long distances, picking up things that could be fossils."
At some point, however, she noticed something.
"A piece of rusty little thing,' probably as big as my palm."
"It lies on the ground."
Her first reaction was that it was just a piece of wood, because it was something that people found in the Falls bed -- a prehistoric plant body.
But that night, back at the camp...
NR: "I took out my hand with a microscope," and I looked more closely, and I suddenly realized, "This thing doesn't look like it's a year round."
"Maybe it's a question of preservation," but it really looks like..."
"Bones."
So over the next four years, she went back and forth to that location, and eventually she collected 30 pieces of debris from the same bone, many of which were very small.
A little zipper bag can fit in.
And then she tried to put the pieces together like a puzzle.
But this is very challenging.
It breaks into a lot of tiny pieces, and we try to recover with sand and ash, but it looks bad.
In the end, we used a three-dimensional surface scanner.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
And finally, it turns out that it's much easier to recover in a virtual way.
"When they're all put together, it feels really amazing."
How sure are you that you spell it right, that you spell it the way it is?
Is there any way you could spell it the other way, and finally spell it out a little parrot or something?
"Uh, no. We must have done the right thing."
She found her molding of a jawbone, that is, a calf bone, and the jawbone came from a hoof-and-hoe mammal, like cattle, sheep, and so on.
But there's no way it's a cow or a sheep.
It's really too big.
"This thing is really big. It's a huge animal."
So what kind of animal would it be?
Now there's a bottleneck, so she shows a piece of it to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and then they have ideas.
"We used a little saw, and then we scratched a little bit at the edge of the debris, and then there was some really amazing smell from there."
It smells a little like burnt skin.
It's the smell Natalia knew, and she smelled when she cut the skull at the general anatomy lab, and that's the gel protein.
The plyon protein makes our bones hard.
In general, after all these years, it will decompose naturally.
But in this case, the North Pole is like a natural freezer that keeps it.
After a year or two, Natalia went to a conference in Bristol, where she saw one of her colleagues, Mike Barclay, in a demonstration of a new technology, he called it "Pelatin Fingerprinting."
In fact, there's a slight difference in the structure of the gel proteins of different species, so if you have an unknown bone of gel protein information, you can match the gel protein information of the known species, so who knows, maybe you found the matching information.
So she sent Mike a piece of debris with a FedEx.
"Of course, you keep an eye on the distribution. It's important."
And then he took samples, and he compared them to 37 currently known mammal species.
I found a pair!
The final conclusion is that what Natalia found in the high Circus was a 3.5 million-year-old bone from...
A camel.
And I was thinking, "What are you kidding me about?" "If we're not wrong, it's amazing."
So they tested a lot of fragments, and they got the same results for each fragment.
However, judging by the size of the bone they found, this means that the camel is 30 percent bigger than the modern camel.
So this camel is about 2.7 meters tall and weighs up to a ton.
(Exclaims) Yeah.
Natalia found a "arctic camel."
Now you hear the word "camel," and there's a picture of the two-fested camels in East and Central Asia.
But it's more likely that the image in your mind is more like this: single-peak camels, typical desert animals, often out in hot deserts, for example, the Middle East or the Sahara, with a super-large hump on their backs that can store water for long distances in the desert, with big feet to help them step over the dunes.
So how the hell did these guys get to the high Arctic Circle?
In fact, scientists already knew, before Natalia found out, that camels were the first to come from America.
They're coming from here.
Forty-five million years of camel existence, 40 million years, you could only find them in North America, 20 different species, maybe more.
"If we line them up, do they look different?"
"Yes, their body sizes are very different."
Some necks are very long, so they function like giraffes."
Some have long noses, like crocodiles.
"They're especially primitive, some of the earliest may be very small," almost like a little rabbit."
What? Rabbit-sized camels?
"The earliest ones are."
"That you may not even recognize."
Oh, my God, I want a rabbit camel to be a pet!
"I know, it's gonna be great, right?"
And then about 3 million to 7 million years ago, one of the branches of the camels moved south to South America, where they evolved into American camels or goats, and the other branch crossed the Bering Land Bridge to Asia and Africa.
At the end of the last glacier, the camels of North America were completely extinct.
Well, scientists already know that, but it doesn't exactly explain Natalia's discovery of camels so north.
Here, in terms of temperature, it's the opposite of Sahara.
To be honest, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher than it is now.
So there can be a Northern Forest, sort of like today's Yukon River Basin or Siberia.
But they still have six months of winter, and all the ponds are frozen.
You'll meet a blizzard.
You'll meet 24 consecutive hours of night.
What the hell is going on?
How can these superstars of the Sahara desert survive in these harsh conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues think they've found the answer.
And that's a pretty smart answer.
What if these camel properties, unlike what we think, were created to adapt to the conditions of the Sahara, but evolved because of the harsh winter?
What if the big feet didn't go over the dunes, but over the snow boots?
What if the humpes -- it's a big story, they don't store moisture, they're fat, they're actually designed to allow camels to survive a six-month cold winter with scarce food?
What if long after that, after they crossed the continental bridge, they adapted these winter features to the hot desert environment?
For example, those humps might be good for camels in the hot zone, because when your fat piles are in the same place, you know, like a "fat backpack," which means that your body's insulation doesn't have to cover its entire body.
So it makes it easier to radiate.
It's this crazy idea that makes camels look like typical desert features, suddenly becoming evidence of their origins in the high Arctic.
Actually, I'm not the first one to tell this story.
Others have already spoken of it as a tribute to the wonders of biological evolution, or as a glimpse of future climate change.
But I love this story for another different reason.
For me, it's a story about us, about how we know the world, about how that perception changes.
My profession is historian.
And I found that, in fact, a lot of scientists are historians.
They've got the past figured out.
They tell about the history of the universe, the Earth and the life of the Earth.
As a historian, you have to think about how this story goes on.
"We make up stories, and then we go along with it, and it's like a desert camel, right?"
"It's a great story! The camels are perfect for the desert."
Apparently, the camels lived there all the time."
But at any time, you might find some small leads.
You may find something small, forcing you to recreate everything you think you know.
And like this example, this scientist finds this fragment, and she thinks it's wood, and because of it, the science community has come up with a whole new, counter-intuitive theory, explaining why this strange, look-alike creature, the hairy monster, has grown into what it is.
For me, it completely subverts my perception of camels.
It went from being a creature that was specific to this particular environment to being a global traveler, just happened to be in the Sahara desert, and could be anywhere at any time.
It's Azuly.
Hey, Azuly! Are you all right?
Come on, I brought you something to eat.
Azuly just finished her special gig, coming from the Radio City Hall of New York.
This is not a joke.
Anyway... seriously, Azuly is here as a living example of how the story of the world is changing rapidly.
We need to be proactive, to be bold, to change, to reimagine.
Azuly, aren't you right?
Really, we're only a fraction of what we see in the world.
Thank you.
Today's computers are so amazing, we even ignore how bad they actually are.
I'm going to discuss this with you today, and how we can solve it with neuroscience.
First of all, I'm taking you back to Harlem's cold night of 2011, which meant a lot to me.
I'm sitting in a bar next to Columbia University, where I'm majoring in computer science and neuroscience, and I'm having an interesting conversation with a classmate about the power of holographic photography, which will replace computers one day.
And just as our conversation got to the best of things, as expected, his phone rang.
He picked up his cell phone and started typing under his head.
And he looked at me and said, "Go on, I'm listening."
But it's clear that his eyes are not focused, and that a wonderful moment is just passing away.
Meanwhile, across from the bar, I noticed another student was holding his cell phone, and this time there was a crowd around the screen.
He's looking at pictures of Instagram, and these kids are laughing.
And they're so happy with the same technology, and I'm so frustrated, and that contrast of this kind prompts me to think.
And as I went deeper into my thinking, I became more and more aware of the fact that the problem here is not electronic information, but simply the location of the information, which separates me from my friends, but brings these children together.
It's clear that they're being associated with something, like our ancestors have evolved their social perceptions, like telling stories about bonfires.
That, in my view, is exactly what the tools should do.
They should extend our body function.
I think today, computers are doing the opposite thing.
Whether you send an e-mail to your wife, or a symphony note, or just comfort a friend, you're almost in the same way.
You bend over to these squares, play buttons and menus, and more cubes appear.
I think it's a wrong way, and I think we can start using a more natural machine.
The machine we use should be able to bring our work back to real life.
We should use machines that can use neuroscience to extend our senses, not limit them.
Now I happen to have a machine like this here.
It's called Meta 2.
Let's try.
Now I can see the audience, and I can see my hands.
On the count of 3, 2, 1, we'll see a hologram of images, a very real hologram in front of me, in front of the glasses I'm wearing right now.
Of course this could be anything we're going to buy, or something we're going to learn, and I could have my hands very easily controlled its movement.
And I think Iron Man would be proud.
We'll be back later.
If you're thinking the same thing as I am, you should be thinking about what you can do with this technology, and let's see some examples.
My mom was an architect, so naturally, the first thing I imagined was to make a concrete building, not to use those floor plans.
In fact, she's now touching the design to choose an interior decoration.
These were filmed by GoPro in my glasses.
The next case of use is personal to me, and it's Professor Adam Gozare's glass brain project, thanks to the UCSF's authorization.
As a student in neuroscience, I'm always surprised that I can use a real machine to learn and remember the abilities of these complex brain structures, so that I can touch and manipulate different brain structures.
Now what you're seeing is called enhancing reality, but for me, it's just part of a more important story -- a story about how we start using digital devices to extend our bodies, not to limit our physical functioning.
Well...
In the next few years, human beings will go through a transformation, I think.
We're going to start covering a whole digital layer of information in the real world.
Take some time to imagine what that means to the storyteller, to the painter, to the brain surgeon, to the interior decorator, perhaps to all of us here today.
I think what we're doing as a group is really trying and trying to imagine how we can create this new reality, in a way that expands the human experience, instead of playing out our reality, or bringing reality and digital information together.
That's what I'm very interested in doing.
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.
Within about five years -- and this will not be the smallest device -- in about five years, these will all look like strip-shaped glasses that are placed in front of you, capable of projecting holographic images.
Just as we don't really care about the hardware parameters of different phones -- which cell phone we buy is about the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I always want to build an iOS based on the brain, if that's possible.
And it's very important that we make sure that it works, because these things don't spend less time with us than we have access to the Windows image user interface.
I don't know what you think, but living in Windows makes me feel a little scary.
In order to isolate the individual most intuitive interfaces into infinite distances, we use neuroscience to guide our design, rather than allowing a bunch of designers to argue in the design room.
Our theory of evolution is called "minimum resistance neural tubes."
At every moment of change, we connect the brain iOS system to our brain, for the first time, in our brain language.
In other words, we're trying to create a zero-learning curve computer.
We're building a system that you've always known how to use.
These are the first three design guides we use in this new form of user experience.
First of all, you're the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they make your brain have to go around a few more curves to decode them.
And what we're going to do is we're going the opposite of the "minimum resistance neural tubes."
And at the same time, in enhancing reality, you can certainly put your hologram TED screen here, put your hologram email on the other side of the table, and your space memory has evolved so well that it can be accurately extracted.
You can put Tesla's hologram on the Internet right here -- or my legitimate team will tell me any pattern before coming on stage.
Well, your brain does know how to get back to reality.
The second interface guide we call "contact visible."
What do babies do when they see what they're interested in?
They'll try to reach out and grab it.
That's how natural machines work.
The visual system actually gets a very basic boost, and we can call it the physical feeling -- it's the feeling that all parts of our body are in space.
By reaching out directly to the people we work with, we don't just control it better, we can understand it more deeply.
That's what contact looks like.
But it's not enough for us to experience things ourselves.
We're the social primates.
And that reminds me of our third guide, which comes from our first story, the holographic bonfire:
Our mirror -- the nervous subsystem shows that we can be better associated with everyone and with our work, if we can see each other's faces and hands with stereo images.
So, if you look at the video behind me, you can see that two Meta users are operating the same hologram image, creating eye contact, focusing on this thing, instead of being distracted by outside devices.
Let's try it again with the concept of neuroscience.
Again, our favorite interface, the brain's iOS system.
I'm going to take a step forward, and I'm going to go up ahead and grab these glasses, and I'm going to put them on the table.
I'm in a moment with you, and we're connected.
My space memory is working, and I can go over and grab it, and then bring it back here and remind myself that I'm an operating system.
Now I feel like I'm working, and I can go over and make these glass cracks into thousands of pieces, and I'm touching the sensors of my hands right now.
But it's not enough to just see this, so soon, my co-founder, Ryan, will call me on a 3D call -- Ryan?
Hi, Ryan. How are you?
Gentlemen, I can see this man appearing before me in the form of a three-dimensional projection.
And his images are very real.
Thank you.
My mirror-neurological subsystem shows that this will replace the phone in the near future.
Ryan, how are you?
RYAN: I'm fine. We can finally show it on site.
Ryan, give you a little gift from the brain of the hologram that we saw in the short film.
Gentlemen, this will change not only the way we call, but also the way we work together.
Thank you very much.
Thanks, Ryan.
REAN: You're welcome.
MILON GREBERZ: So, guys, this is the message that I found in that bar in 2011: the future of computers is not locked in these screens.
It's here, in our bodies.
So if I can leave you with one idea today, that's that the natural machine isn't just in the vision of the future, it's right here, in 2016.
That's why hundreds of employees in Meta, including administrators, executives, designers, engineers -- before TED2017, we'll throw away our external display equipment, and then replace it with a real, more natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question, and there's been a lot of hologram shows last year.
Sometimes there's a debate in technology about whether we actually see something real on the screen?
And that's a problem in this field, and in a way, technology is showing a broader view than you actually see with your glasses.
Did we just see the real effect?
It's definitely the real effect.
And not only that, but we also used extra measuring techniques, using GoPro to shoot through real lenses, to get the different short films that you see here.
And we want to try to actually see the world through what we see through our glasses, and not just see the locals.
CA: Thank you very much for the show.
MG: Thank you very much.
I'm from one of the freest, most tolerant and most promising cities in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a great Seattle family.
My mother was an artist, my father was a university professor, and I was grateful to them for raising me, because I was perfectly able to plan my life on my own in the way I felt fit.
And actually, my choices are different from those of my parents.
When I was 19, I dropped out of college -- dropped out, or, more accurately, fired.
I was on the road to becoming a professional French trumpeter, and that was my lifelong dream.
I'm performing indoors in America and Europe, and I've been on tour for a few years, with a very good jazz guitarist, Charlie Byrd.
When I was in my twenties, I was excited to join the Spanish Barcelona Symphony.
What a wonderful life!
And my parents never complained.
They've been supporting me all along.
Even if that wasn't their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son is going to rest for a decade."
And there's an awkward conversation about my life that I want to share with you.
I was 27 years old, and I came home from Barcelona, and it was Christmas, and I went home to see my parents, and when I was cooking for my mother, it was just the two of us in the kitchen.
She was silent and silent.
I think something's wrong.
And I asked my mother, "Mom, what are you thinking?"
She said, "Your father and I are really worried about you."
I'm surprised, "What is it? What are you worried about now?"
She said, "I want you to answer my question honestly: Did you vote for the Republicans?"
The truth is, I'm not interested in politics, I'm just a French trumpet player.
But I kind of understood, and they sensed something, so there was some confusion.
And then I became a fanatic of capitalism, and let me tell you why.
Believe it or not, it's rooted in all the research I've been doing on poverty.
When I was a kid in Seattle, I remember that was the first time I ever touched real poverty.
My family belongs to the lower middle class, but it's certainly not real poverty.
Not at all.
The first time I saw the true face of poverty was in the early 1970s, when I was only six or seven years old.
Like many of us, this is an ordinary example.
That's a painting of National Geography in an East African country with kids my age, flies flying in his face and having an inflated stomach.
I knew he couldn't make it, I knew it, and I couldn't help it.
Some of you may remember a painting like that, not necessarily exactly the same, but a very similar one.
It shows the Western world the intolerable poverty in the rest of the world.
And that's a picture that I can't keep in my head, with me growing up, going to school, dropping out of school, starting to form my own family.
I wonder, what happened to the kid?
Or what about people like him in the rest of the world?
I started to study this question, and even though I was no longer in college, I was still looking for answers: what happened to the world's poorest people?
Is it worse, or is it better?
I finally found the answer and changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
In fact, most Americans feel that from childhood, from the moment they see it, to the day they see it, they feel like they're going to die.
Poverty is getting worse, and if you ask Americans, "Does the world's poverty problem get worse or better?" 70 percent of people say that hunger has been worse since the early 1970s.
But that's the truth.
It was a moment that made me change my mind and made me understand.
From 1970 to the present, the percentage of the world's population suffering from hunger correction through inflation and living on less than $1 a day has fallen by 80 percent.
The percentage of the world's poorest people has decreased by 80 percent since I was a kid.
And I don't know that.
My friends, it's a miracle!
This is something we should celebrate.
This is the greatest anti-poverty achievement in human history, and it happened in our lifetime.
When I knew that fact, I thought, what made it possible to get out of poverty?
Because if you don't know why, it's just a flash.
We're going to replicate success, to get the 200 million people still struggling with poverty out of the status quo, because that's what we've been talking about: since I was a kid, 2 billion of the poorest people, our brothers and sisters, out of poverty.
I want to save the remaining 2 billion people, so I have to know why.
I'm looking for answers.
It's not a political answer, because I don't care about political answers.
Now, still don't care.
I'm eager to get the best answers from mainstream economists, left-wing, right-wing and middle-class economists.
Down there.
Let me start with specific reasons.
From childhood to now, 2 billion people have been lifted out of poverty.
There are five reasons for this.
II. Free trade
III. Property rights
IV. Rule of law
Fifth: Entrepreneurship
This is the result of the free market economy system that swept the world after 1970.
I'm not naive.
I know that a free market economy is not perfect, and I know that a free market economy does not meet all our needs for a better world.
But it's great.
And it goes beyond politics.
That's what I learned and realized.
Capitalism is more than capital accumulation.
The great thing about it is that it's about ambition, as many people on this stage have said, is that it's about dreams, and it's rooted in a free market system.
We must make that clear to more people.
Now, I would like to talk about my second epicentre, which is related to the first one, and I believe it will contribute not only to the development of the world, but also to the development of our country.
In other words, the idea of lifting people out of poverty is, "The free market has created the greatest wealth in history.
And lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.”
Who's the famous word?
Like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
Wrong!
It's President Obama!
Why do I have a deep memory?
Because he said it to me.
I can't believe it.
I said, "Hallelujah!"
And more than that, I said, "What a great opportunity."
You know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, we were doing an event at Georgetown University on the subject we were working on.
And then I came up with a solution to the biggest problem facing the United States today.
It's whether liberals or conservatives come together to discuss these ideas to help those who need our help most.
I don't have to say that everyone here knows that we are in crisis, in the United States and in other politically divided countries of the world,
This is an urgent issue.
This is a source of concern.
Last year, an article was published in one of the most influential and cutting-edge scientific journals in the West, the National Academy of Sciences.
That's a 2014 article on political motivation asymmetrical.
Psychologists describe this phenomenon as assuming that your mind is based on love, and the other's mind is based on hate.
This is common in world disputes.
For example, between Palestinians and Israelis.
The author of this article finds that in the United States today, a large number of Republicans and Democrats are divided on political motives.
Now most of the people who are politically active in our country think that they are driven by love, while the rest are driven by hatred.
Think about it.
Most people always say, "My mind is based on love, and I want to help people, and the other part, they're evil, and they're trying to knock me down."
Societies that are so divided cannot progress.
That's impossible.
What are we going to do about this?
First, let's face it honestly: differences exist.
We can't reduce our differences, because that's childish behavior.
There is a considerable amount of in-depth research on this.
My friend Jonathan Hayt is a regular TED guest.
He's a professor of psychology at New York University.
He studied the ideas, values and moral values of different people, and how different they were.
He proved that conservatives and liberals have very different opinions about what they think is important.
For example, Jonathan Hayt shows that liberals care more about poverty than about economic freedom by 59 percent.
And conservatives care about economic freedom 28 percent more than they care about poverty.
It looks like an irreconcilable disagreement, doesn't it?
We can't be together? No!
Our strength lies precisely in our differences.
Remember what stopped poverty:
It's an obsession with and concern for poverty, and a free economic order around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people, we want to help another 200 million people out of poverty.
There is no other way.
Yeah.
What are we gonna do?
It's a delicate thing, isn't it?
We have to think creatively.
A lot of innovative ideas are on this stage.
Yes! Those extraordinary social entrepreneurships.
We have to invest abroad, in a sustainable, responsible and ethical way.
But you know what we really need?
We need to open a new horizon of flexible thinking.
We need less "foreseeable" than that.
Right?
Have you ever felt your mind beginning to become predictable?
Start playing by the rules?
Do you feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, on the one hand, we talk about conservatives, always talking about taxes, rules and big government rule.
And on the other hand, liberals, talking about the economy, always about income inequality.
Right? It's really important, it's important to me, it's important to you.
But when people who are starving need our help, these are just distractions.
We should unite in the best way to reduce poverty as much as we can, only when conservatives realize that they need liberals to worry about poverty, and liberals also need conservative parties to be obsessed with free markets.
We will succeed, and only if we choose this path will this diversity breed the powerful power of the future nation.
How do we achieve that, and how do we achieve it together?
I have some action advice for you, and for myself.
Remember, it's not good enough just to tolerate other people's dissent.
Not enough.
We need to remember that we need people who disagree with us, because there's a group of people who need our help, and they're still waiting.
What are you going to do? How are you going to do it?
From where? From here!
All of us here, we're all happy.
We have people who listen to us.
We're very successful, we have leadership.
When people hear the thought of our unknown ideology, maybe they listen to us.
Perhaps that is the starting point for success.
That's the first point. The second one.
Second point: I'm asking you, and I'm asking myself to be a certain person with a vague line, to be a vague, hard-to-finished person.
If you're a conservative, then be a conservative, who's always talking about poverty, and stick to the moral imperative of fighting for the poor.
If you're a liberal, do a liberal who often praises the charm of the free market that we run responsibly.
If we do that, the two targets will be ready.
First of all, we started working to help the next 2 billion people solve their problems like we did before, and we'll do more in the future, and that's what we can do.
The second is that we may be able to overcome this terrible ideological war that has afflicted us, turning it into a competition based on the idea of solidarity and mutual respect.
Maybe by then, just maybe we'll find out that our so-called differences are not so irreconcilable.
Thank you!
When I went to college, I was a political major, which meant I had to write a lot of papers.
When a regular student writes a paper, they may be like this, sharing the task.
So, you know, it might start a little slow, but a week later it's been written a lot, and sometimes it's written a lot more, and finally it's done, and it's not fucked up.
That's what I want.
At least that's my plan.
I'm ready to start, but in fact, when I write papers, I do.
And it happens every time you write a paper.
And finally, when it comes to 90 pages of graduate papers, it's supposed to take a year to write them.
I know it's not my usual thing to do with a paper like this.
Graduation papers are a big project.
So I planned it, decided to do it.
This is how one year's work is organized.
At first, a little less work, a little more work in the middle of the month, and at the end of the day, the high-speed gear went all the way, just like the little steps.
How hard can it be to climb the stairs?
It's no big deal, right?
But then something interesting happened.
The first few months?
Come and go, I didn't do much.
So there's this great change plan.
And then... the middle few months went by, and I didn't write a few words, so that's what happened.
And then two months to one month, and two weeks to go.
And then one day I realized that there were only three days left before the deadline, and I didn't write a single word, so I did the only thing I could: I spent 72 hours writing 90 pages, working for two full days, and people shouldn't spend two nights in a row going through campus full speed, moving in slowly, delivering papers before the deadline.
I thought it was over.
And then a week later I got a call from the school.
They said, "Are you Tim Reban?"
I said, "Yes."
They said, "We need to talk to you about the paper."
And I said, "Okay."
And they went on to say, "This is the best paper we've ever seen."
That didn't happen.
This paper is very, very bad.
I just wanted to enjoy this moment, when all of you thought, "This guy is awesome!"
That's not true. That paper sucks.
Anyway, I'm a writer now.
I write for Breaking the Sands to the Bottom.
A few years ago I decided to write an article about delays.
My procrastination always confuses those around me who don't delay, so I'd like to explain to those who don't procrastination what the procrastination is really thinking in their head, and why we procrastites do it.
My hypothesis is that the brain of the procrastination person is different from that of the procrastination person.
To prove that, I found a MRI lab that allowed me to scan my brain and a brain that was not proven to be a procrastination, and then I could compare the two brains.
I brought them all today.
I'd like you to carefully compare whether there's a difference between the two.
I know you're not a trained brain specialist, but it may not seem obvious, but let's take a look, okay?
It's an undelayed brain.
Now,
It's my brain.
There is a difference between the two.
In both brains there is a rational decision maker, but in the brain of the retard, there is a monkey called instant satisfaction.
What does that mean for the procrastination?
It means everything's fine before this happens.
[It's the best time to start working...] [No!] So when rational decision makers make rational decisions, try to do something productive, the monkey doesn't want to do it, and he starts to take control of the wheel, and he says, "In fact, let's read about the Wikipedia scandal about Nancy Cregan/Toni Yahadin, because I just remembered it.
And then let's go to the fridge, and look at this for 10 minutes and there's nothing new.
And then, let's continue to browse on the video site, starting with Richard Feynman talking about the magnetic video, and always seeing an interview with Justin Bieber's mom and seeing the earth as it is.
"It's all taking time, so our schedule today can't afford to work.
I'm sorry."
What's going on?
The instant satisfaction monkey doesn't seem to be the one who wants him to fuck the prosecution.
He's totally alive right now.
He has no memory of the past, no idea of the future, and he only cares about two things: simplicity and happiness.
In the animal world, that's okay.
If you're a dog, you'll have a great success if you spend your life simple and happy!
And for monkeys, humans are another kind of animal.
You sleep well, you eat well, you breed the next generation, and that's probably okay in tribal times.
But if you haven't noticed, we're not living in tribal times.
We're in a state-of-the-art civilization, and the monkeys don't know what that is.
That's why there's another guy in our head, the rational decision maker, who gives us the power to do things that other animals can't do.
We can see the future.
We can take care of the big picture.
We can make long-term plans.
And he wants to take all this into account.
He wants us to do anything worth doing now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do something simple and happy, like eat, sleep or enjoy the rest of the time that you deserve.
That's why there's a convergence between immediate satisfaction with monkeys and rational decision makers.
Sometimes they agree.
But sometimes it's more meaningful to do things that are harder and less enjoyable, because of the whole picture.
At this point, there is a conflict between the two.
For the procrastination, every conflict ends this way, and he spends a lot of time in the orange area, which is simple and happy, but meaningless.
I call this area a dark playground.
The dark playground is a place where all stallors know it.
This is where we're supposed to be at leisure when it's not supposed to be.
The joy of being in the dark playground is not really happiness, because it's completely unhelpful, and it brings guilt, fear, anxiety, self-loathing, which is the feeling of all those who delay.
And the question is, in this case, how can the monkeys take control of the steering wheel, and how can the stallers take themselves to the blue area, where it's not that comfortable, but there are a lot of important things to do?
The staller actually had a guardian angel, who always despised him and guarded him, at those darkest moments it was called a panic monster.
The panic monster is hibernation for most of the time, but it wakes up suddenly when the deadline is close or when it's in danger of being ugly in front of the public, when it's facing a career disaster, or when it has other terrible consequences.
And the important thing is, he's the only thing the monkey's afraid of.
Recently, in my life, the panic monster became quite important, because TED staff contacted me six months ago and invited me to give a speech.
Of course, I promise.
I used to dream of being able to do a TEDTalk.
But in this excitement, rational decision makers seem to be thinking of something else.
He would say, "We know exactly what we just promised.
Do we have the capabilities we need to complete that task in the future?
We have to sit down and get to work."
And the monkey said, "Absolutely agree, but let's turn on Google Earth and push the camera 200 feet underground in India, and then spend two and a half hours rolling up to the country's surface, and let's feel India better."
That's what I did that day.
When six months became four months, then two months, then one month, TED staff started delivering speakers.
I opened the site to see my face staring at myself.
Guess who woke up this time?
So the panic monster went crazy, and a few seconds later, the whole system went into chaos.
And the monkey, remember? He's afraid of the panic monster.
So finally, rational decision makers can finally fuck the prosecution, and I can start preparing this speech.
It seems to the panic monster that all those pretty stupid delaying behaviors, like me, took two weeks to start writing the opening words of the paper, and then miraculously had the incredible work enthusiasm to write eight pages all night long.
This whole situation, together with those three roles, is the system of stallers.
Not good, but at least it'll work.
This is what I decided to write on my blog a few years ago.
After the release, I was surprised by the responses received.
I got thousands of emails, people from different parts of the world, doing different things.
There are nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots of PhD students.
It's basically the same thing: "I have the same problem."
But I'm impressed by that contrast, the easy tone of the post and the heavy tone of the mail.
These people have a strong sense of frustration because delays affect their lives, because monkeys control their ideas.
After thinking, my question is, if the delayr's system works, then what the hell is going on?
Why do these people all have such a dark corner?
As a result, I found that there were two kinds of delays.
What I'm talking about today, the examples given above have deadlines.
When there's a deadline, the effect of delay is limited to a short period of time because the panic monster will intervene.
But for the second delay, it happened without a deadline.
For example, you want to start your own business or work in the arts, there's no deadline at first, because nothing happens before you start working hard, and there's no push to keep things going.
There's no deadline for important things other than career, like visiting your family, or exercising your body, trying to improve your relationship, or leaving a relationship that's not satisfactory.
If the procrastination does these difficult things with only one mechanism -- the panic monster -- then the problem arises, because in these open-ended situations, the panic monster never happens.
He doesn't need to wake up, so the consequences of the delay are unlimited, and they only extend indefinitely.
And this long delay, which is more interesting, shorter, based on deadlines, is less obvious and less often talked about.
It usually affects us quietly and quietly.
It's probably the source of a lot of long-term unhappyness and guilt.
I think that's why those people sent e-mails, and that's why they're in such a bad situation.
It's not because they're rushing for a project.
It's this long delay that makes them feel like they're sometimes just a bystander in their own lives.
Their frustration is not because they can't achieve their dreams; they can't even start chasing their dreams.
So after reading these emails, I realized a little bit that I don't think there's anyone without delay.
Yes, I think we're all stallers.
You may not be like us, and everything's a mess, and some people may be able to face up to the deadline, but remember: the meanest trick of monkeys is the part where there is no deadline.
Now I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the Life Calendar.
Assuming a person can live to the age of 90, every week is a grid.
There aren't many cells, especially since we've been living for so many years.
I think we all need to take some time to take a closer look at this life calendar.
We need to think seriously about what we really delayed, because everybody's stalling something.
We have to always realize that we have to meet this monkey's existence immediately.
That's what we all have to do.
And because there's not a lot of grids, this should probably start today.
Well, maybe not today, but...
You know.
In the near future.
Thank you.
The soul and body are in a church in Texas, and that's the last night of our lives.
Like we're in this room right now, except it's all a creaking wooden bench with a broken red cloth, a accordion on my left, a choir on my back, and a christening pool on the back wall.
Anyway, it's like this room.
The same strong sense of suspense, the same deep desire for salvation, the same bitter sweat in the palms, and the same unattractive people in the back rows.
It was December 31, 1999, and that night, as far as I know, Christ came to us, and the world was coming to an end.
I was 12 years old, and I came to the age of responsibility.
I realized that it was so unfair for Jesus to come back, that I was responsible for everything I've done before, but when I stopped complaining, I thought I'd better clean up the house.
I'll go to church as much as I can.
I was afraid of the silence around, just like people were afraid of noises, just to make sure God wasn't playing with me and came back early and left me behind.
But in case he's really early, I've got a backup plan, read in Apocalypse.
I read in the text that, if I had a midnight party, I hadn't been taken away, and I still had a chance.
All I need is not to defeat the devil in the name of the heretic, to overcome the plague, and to defeat the Antichrist.
It's gonna be pretty hard -- but I'm sure I can do it.
But the time for preparation has passed.
It's 11:50 p.m.
We still have 10 minutes, and the priest lets us get up from the bench and go down to the altar, because he wants us to pray at the dawn of midnight.
So the crowds split into groups, and they're in a designated position.
The choir is still on the stage, the church deacon and their wives -- actually, I prefer to call them "breathing bourgeois" in the first row of the altar.
You know, in America, even the Night of Adventists has VIP seats.
And behind the bourgeois immersion, it's the old people -- the young backslides of these men and women, in the cotton fields of East Texas, they're bent on the sun, and the ravine faces are burned into the high browns, like the clays of East Texas, and they're cut out of life outside East Texas and the world's wonderful dreams and dreams, sometimes more than their backs.
Yes. These men and women are my idols and stars.
They've waited their whole lives for this moment, as their medieval ancestors yearned for the end of the world, as my grandmother yearned for the Oprah talk show, to be aired on Channel 8 at 4:00 a.m. every day.
When she walked to the altar, I snuck behind her, because I was pretty sure my grandmother was going to heaven.
I thought if I held her hand tight in this prayer, I might go with her.
So I grabbed it, and I closed my eyes, and I listened, and I waited.
The prayer is even greater.
Respond to the cries of prayer the same bigger.
The organ rings and weaves with the sound of the song.
The heat waves roll and the sweat of the hand is even more sour.
My hands are tighter, and I don't want to be abandoned by God.
My eyes are closing even tighter, and I don't want to see the essence being taken away, and the bad stuff being left behind.
Suddenly a voice echoes over the head: "Amen."
It's over.
I'm looking at the clock.
It's past midnight.
I looked at the elders, and their Saviors didn't come, and they were so proud that they didn't show even a scratch, they believed too deeply, too long, and now it's too late to doubt it.
But I'm angry at them.
They were fooled, tricked, fooled, and then I followed them.
I did the prayer they did, and I tried to resist the desire in my heart.
I'm not once, I'm twice, I fell in that cold bath.
I used to believe that.
What do we do now?
I went home to turn on the TV, just in time for Peter Jennings to announce the new millennium, and the whole world was celebrating the New Year.
I suddenly realized that it was strange to think that Jesus was going to come back and forth again and again, just because the time zones were different everywhere.
It makes me feel worse, kind of hurt, really.
But that night, I didn't stop believing.
I just believe in another thing: "It's possible not to believe."
It's possible that all the answers I know are wrong, and it's possible that the question is wrong in itself.
Now, the mountain peaks of the faith that once stood, there was a spring running all the way to the foot of the mountain, a spring of doubt, and it was destined to become a river of great rivers.
All the dramatic stories of my life could go back to the church that night, when my Savior didn't come, and I was so sure that if I didn't call it a lie, at least it wasn't the truth.
Although the way most of you meet the Millennium is very different, I believe you're here because some of you have done the same thing that I did, after the beginning of the new century, after my mother died, after my father left home, after my Savior did not come.
I put out my hands, and I searched hard for something to believe in.
When I was 18 years old at Yale, I searched, and I believed that coming all the way from a town in Texas, I had a chance to get out of all the misery and hardship I've been through, out of all the broken dreams and disabling bodies.
But when I came home on winter break, my head was stuck on the ground, my hands were tied behind my back, the gun of the robber was pointed at my head, and I knew that even the best education would not save me.
When I went to the Lehman Brothers in 2008, I searched.
Hopeful -- I'm excited to call my family, say we'll never be poor again.
But when I watched this financial temple become a broken wall in front of my eyes, I knew that even the best job would not save me.
When I went to Washington, D.C., as a young journalist, I searched, and I heard a voice from Illinois: "It's been too long," but in this election, America is about to change."
But when the work of Parliament came to a halt, the country almost collapsed, so hope and change turned into a cruel, cold joke, and I knew that even a new political rebirth would not save me.
I kneel before the altar of the American dream, pray to the great men of the time, pray for success, pray for money, pray for power.
But every time the midnight bell rings, I open my eyes and see all these myths die.
From this grave, I started searching again, not because I was brave, but because I knew that if I didn't believe, I would die.
So I went to another holy place to worship, Harvard Business School -- and this time, I knew I couldn't simply accept the salvation offered by the College.
No, I know I have more to do.
It all started in the dark corner of a crowded party, which was a late night of the harsh first winter in Massachusetts, and I asked three friends a question, and some young people who really wanted it would always ask, "How about we go out on our own?"
We don't know where we're going, how we're going, but we know we have to go.
Because what we've been dying for all our lives, like Jack Kerouac wrote, "Into the endless night, disappearing in the distant sky." Go out and see what people all over the country are doing.
So even if there's opposition, saying we've taken too much risk, there's not much to gain, and we're on our way.
We traveled 13,000 kilometers across the United States in the summer of 2013, across Montana's cow ranch, through the abandoned city of Detroit, through New Orleans's swamp wetlands, where we found some people, working for them, and they started small businesses that used the goal as a bottom line.
After studying West Point School of Capitalism, we realized that the idea was revolutionary.
And this idea is spreading, and it turns out to be a not-for-profit organization called "Master of Management" going all over the United States, and that's the main reason why I'm standing on this stage today.
It spread because we found in this generation a strong desire to achieve the goals, the values of our lives.
It spread because we found countless entrepreneurs in the corner of America, who created jobs, changed people's lives, and they needed a little help.
But to be honest, it spreads, because I'm trying to spread it.
There's nothing I don't do to convince more people that we can heal this broken country by relying on a small business.
But that's the process of the evangelical mission that led me to a different evangelical process, and I'm going to share it with you today.
About one night a year ago, at the Natural Sciences Museum in New York, we went to an alumni dinner at Harvard Business School.
Under a full-scale model of a whale, I sit with the giants of this time, and they celebrate their companions and their greatness.
The room was filled with pride, and the total amount of assets in the name of these people was more than $500 billion.
We look down at everything that's made, and we think it's good.
But that happened, and two days later, I went to the Harlem district of New York, and I sat on a city farm, which used to be an abandoned parking lot, listening to a guy named Tony talking about kids, and they went there every day.
All of them are below the poverty line.
A lot of people put all their belongings in their backpacks, afraid they'd be stolen from the shelter.
Some people come to Tony's farm, called Harlem Growing, to get their only meal every day.
Tony told me he started Harlem Growing up on his own pension, and he was a taxi driver for 20 years.
He said he didn't leave a penny for himself because the project was a success, but the resources were extremely scarce.
He said he'd take whatever help he could find.
And I'm going to help him.
But when I left Tony, my heart was sore and the tears were soaking in my eyes.
I felt the burden of enlightenment, and one night I could sit in a room with hundreds of people worth $500 billion talking about the good world, and two days later in another room, just 50 blocks away, a man without pay had to feed his children for one meal a day.
But it's not the social inequality that makes me cry, it's not the hungry, homeless kids, it's not the anger of 1 percent of people, it's the pity of 99 percent of people.
No, I can't calm myself because I finally realize that this country needs a radical change, and I'm just a little fixer.
And I realized that my story represented a group of people who wanted to be self-reliant, even if they were poor and white; that my organization represented all the basic, systematic help that never reached Harlem, or the Appalachian Mountains and the nine sub-districts of New Orleans; and that my screams represented voices that sounded devoid of meaning, unmodified and unbecoming.
And this sense of shame, this sense of shame that washed me up, like the shame of sitting in front of the TV, watching Peter Jennings proclaim the new millennium, over and over and over again.
I was fooled, fooled, confused,
But this time, the hypocritical Savior was me.
You know, I walked all the way from that altar, and that night I felt that the world was about to be destroyed, from a town that used all the dialects, and thought that suffering was God's gift to mankind, and that it was a creed and an eternal truth.
Yes, my journey was too long, so I went all the way back to where I was.
Because we can't sum up, say there's no faith in this age, and no, we believe in something as much as ever.
Some might believe in the prophecy of Bremen Brown or Tony Robbins, and we might believe in the adage of New Yorker or Harvard Business Review.
We may be incredibly convinced of what we're worshipping in TED's church, but we're desperate to believe, and we need faith.
We mimic the words of the charismatic leaders, who are committed to solving all human problems.
We feel that suffering is a gift from the capitalist God, and we see technological development as a creed, as an eternal truth.
But we never realized the human cost, and we wouldn't question a brick, because we were afraid the whole building would collapse.
But if you're upset about what we're used to doing against God, there must be a time to question it.
So my preaching of the gospel is not about breakthroughs, innovations, or sustainable development.
I don't even have faith in the gospel to share with you.
The only thing I have is the Gospel of doubt.
The Gospel of doubt does not stop you from believing, it asks you to believe in something new: "It's possible not to believe."
It's possible that all the answers we know are wrong, and it's possible that the question is wrong in itself.
Yes, the question of the Gospel may mean that our existence, on this stage, in this room, is all wrong.
Because it raises a question: "Why?"
We have so much power in our hands, why is there anyone else in the water?
This kind of questioning has led me to a decision that the organization that I created, "Master Management has gone all over the United States," is going to stop running.
We've disbanded the staff, closed the doors, and we've opened up this model to everyone, and as long as they feel they can do it, they don't need our approval.
This kind of questioning compels me to remove the hat of the "Savior" held on my head, because our lives are too short, too low a chance, and we can't wait for Christ to come back, and the fact is, there's no miracle in the world.
And this challenge, which drives me, gives me hope, when the difficulties are about to crush us, when the path of destiny seems to lead us astray, when our Savior cannot heal the wounds, not our blind faith, but our simple questioning, will cast a little light into the darkness of our lives and the world. Let's speak softly.
Shouting is fine, or simply, very simply, saying, "There's gotta be another way."
Thank you.
Food crisis.
It's in the daily news.
What's that?
There are places in the world where food is too scarce, and there are places where food is abundant.
In some places, genetically modified food saves the world.
Maybe genetically modified food is a problem?
Too many genetically modified agricultural wastewaters create polluted oceans, toxic seawaters, thin nutrients.
This cycle continues.
And I found out that today's discussion is really far from influential.
How do we get this discussion to be understood?
How's the apple food crisis?
I'm sure that in the past week each of you ate an apple.
How long do you think it took an apple to pick it out of your hand?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months -- that's the average time the apples were sold in the U.S. mall from the time they were picked to the time they were sold.
I think, in Europe, it's about as much as anywhere in the world.
And we pick apples, we keep them in cold storage, we input oxygen into the freezer -- in fact, there are documented cases of workers trying to enter this environment to retrieve an apple, and then die, because the air in the freezer is toxic to people in this environment.
Why didn't any of you know about this?
Why didn't I know about this?
Ninety percent of the nutrients in apples -- all the antioxidants in apples -- were lost when we bought them.
It's just a little candy.
Why don't we know the news, and how do we improve the situation?
I think we lack a platform.
I know the platform -- I'll use the computer, and when I was young, I was on the Internet.
I've done a lot of really weird things -- on platforms like this.
But I also met others, and I was able to express my thoughts.
What do you think of food?
If we had a platform, we might find that the problem was very beneficial, "if?"
I'd like to ask: What if the climate is democratic?
This is a global climate map.
The most efficient agricultural production area is green, and the worst is red.
And they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to change, and they're going to become farmers in California, and they're going to become farmers in Mexico.
China has acquired the land of Brazil to grow better food, and we are all environmental slaves.
What if every country has its own climate fit for production?
How does that change our lives?
How will that change the quality of our lives and our nutrition?
The problem with the last generation is that we need more food and low prices.
Welcome to the World Farm.
We built a huge simulation farm.
These lines -- cars, planes, trains, cars.
It's a miracle to be able to provide enough food to 7 billion people, in a situation where very few people are involved in the food production process.
But if...
We build a digital farm?
Digital World Farm.
If you can take this apple, in a way, digitize it, transmit it through a mass point in the air, and reassemble it on the other side?
What if?
Look at these quotes, you know, they encourage me to do this.
First: “Japan's agriculture has no young people, no water, no land, no future.” This is the day I arrived at the South Trinity, which is another station south of Fukushima, after the nuclear power plant accident.
The children went to Sendai and Tokyo, the land was contaminated by a nuclear power plant accident, and they imported 70 percent of their food.
But this is not a phenomenon unique to Japan.
Only 2 percent of the American population is engaged in agriculture-related work.
Two percent of the population is working in agriculture. What answers do you give us?
We look elsewhere in the world, 50 percent of the African population is under the age of 18.
80% of them don't want to be farmers.
Agriculture is too hard.
Small farmers live too hard.
They chose to go to the city.
In India: Farmer families do not have access to the most basic agricultural appliances, and more farmers commit suicide than in the last 10 years.
It's sad to say that.
Where are they going?
To the city.
No young people, all of them went to the city.
So what kind of platform are we building to encourage young people?
Look at this new tractor.
This is my joint harvester.
A few years ago, I went to my home chain and started looking for tools.
I made stupid things that I let plants dance and connect them to my computer and then I destroyed them -- a lot of them.
I finally let them live.
I created one of the closest relationships in my life, because I learned the language of plants.
I want them to grow bigger.
They said, "Boy, do your best!
This is an electronic studio that no one uses.
What can you do?"
Together with the team members, we built a farm in the media lab, a place that used to be thought to be related to electronic life rather than to biology.
In this 60 square metre space, we made enough rations to supply about 300 people a month -- not too much.
There's a lot of interesting technology here.
What's the funniest thing about it?
Nice, white roots, deep green plants harvest once a month.
Is this a new restaurant?
Is this a new sales experience?
Is this a new store?
And what I can be sure of is that this is the first time in a media lab that any plant can be uprooted.
We put the salad in the bag; there's nothing wrong with it.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, a robotic expert, pulls plants up and thinks, "Well, I know about it -- I can make the plan work, and I want to try."
And throughout the process, we'll take the plant out and we'll take some back to the lab, because if you planted it yourself, it wouldn't be abandoned, because it's precious to you.
I have this strange tongue now, because I don't want anyone to eat them before me, and I hope it's delicious.
I eat lettuce every day.
I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat it today."
This lettuce was very sweet that day.
That's because the lettuce is under a lot of pressure and it produces chemical reactions to protect itself: "I don't want to die!"
The taste of plants that don't want to die tastes sweet.
Scientists go back to research on plant physiology.
I think we can all try to be involved.
We look forward to seeing all of your creations, so we think of a laboratory that can be transported elsewhere.
Make this idea out.
The front of the media lab is my lab, with 30 sensors per plant.
If you know genomes or genetics, that's the model, right?
The table groups present a pattern.
And when you say, "I like the strawberry from Mexico," you really like it when it comes to climate conditions like that.
You can encode this climate -- how much carbon dioxide, how much oxygen, how much recipes you create -- you can program to control the state of plants, and the nutrient content, the size, shape, color and quality of plants.
We need data, so we put in a lot of sensors to provide us with data.
You can think about the plants at home, and you look at the plants at home and it's sad because you think, "Why are you dead? Will you talk to me?"
Farmers have the most beautiful eyes for the future, when they were 60 or 70 years old.
They can tell you that plant dies because the soil lacks nitrogen, calcium, or it needs more humid air.
These beautiful eyes won't pass on.
These are farmers' eyes.
We will continue to collect data and information.
We put these data points together with separate plants.
These are the IP address data for all the broccoli in my lab that day.
We have broccoli to track the IP address.
If this isn't weird enough, you can click here to see the plant file.
It shows you how that plant can be downloaded, not what you think, not just when it's edible.
When does it nutrients reach my needs?
When does it taste the same as I expected?
Is there too much water?
Wasn't the sun too long?
It's always a hint.
It can talk to me, it can communicate, we can talk language.
I think that's the first user of the plant Facebook, isn't it?
That's when plant files start making friends.
I mean really -- plants start making friends with plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
And we'll start to understand the complex things that are now only supposed to be.
They may not be friendly with us -- I don't know, maybe they'll be friendly with us, depending on what we do.
This is my lab now.
It's a little more systematic, and my background is the design of the hospital's data centre, and I know how to create a controlled environment.
So -- in this environment, we're experimenting with a variety of things.
This program, the air planting method, was developed by NASA for the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water that they need to transfer to space.
What this program does is give plants exactly what they want -- water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots aren't that complicated, and when you pass them on to them, you can see amazing effects.
Plants have two hearts.
Just because there are two hearts, it shows a four-to-five-fold high rate of growth.
It's a perfect world.
We've gone through a long technological journey to find a different world and we'll keep doing it, but we'll also have new tools, and it'll be a perfect world.
We grow all kinds of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercialized in the past 150 years.
You know we have rare, ancient seed banks?
Seed banks.
That's awesome.
They have living germs that you haven't eaten.
I'm the only one in this room who's ever eaten this tomato.
The problem is, it's sauce tomatoes that we don't know how to cook, so it doesn't look good.
But we've grown all kinds of protein-containing things.
We planted humans -- maybe you can, but we can't.
We realized that the tools were too big, too expensive.
I started putting them around the world for about $100,000.
It's not easy to find people who can dispose of $100,000 at will, so we want to make small tools.
It's actually a project for one of my students -- an undergraduate at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Camille.
Camille and I, and my team, we spent the whole summer retesting, how to make it cheaper, how to work better, how to let others learn how to operate.
And then we send these tools to schools for kids in grades 7 to 11.
If you want to be modest, try to teach the kids something.
I went to this school, and I said, "Let's set it at 65 percent."
A kid in seventh grade asks, "What humidity?"
So I said, "Oh, it's water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you idiot."
So I said, "Well, don't believe me.
In fact -- don't trust me, okay?
Set it to 100.
He set the humidity to 100. What happened?
Start condensing, generating fog, eventually dripping.
And he said, "Oh, humidity is rain.
Why didn't you tell me that before?"
We create interfaces that look like a game.
They have 3D environments, and they can log around the world from cell phones, on computers.
There are different parts of the program -- physical adjustments, sensors.
They've chosen recipes that children in other parts of the world have created.
They choose and activate recipes, plant seeds.
When seeds grow, children can make changes.
They said, "Why do plants need carbon dioxide? Isn't carbon dioxide bad?
It's asphyxiating."
To increase the supply of carbon dioxide, plants are dead.
The plants live well by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide.
Harvesting plants, you created new electronic recipes.
It's a process of repeated design and development and exploration.
They can download all the data they've developed on new plants, or on new electronic recipes, and what does it do -- better or worse?
Imagine these are the core elements of processing.
We can learn a lot.
It's what we call a food computer, put in a school for three weeks.
It's three weeks of planting.
And more importantly, for the first time, this kid thinks he can be a farmer -- or he wants to be a farmer.
So we open up these resources.
They're all online; go home and try to build your first food computer.
It's gonna be hard-- I'm telling you this.
We're in the start-up phase, but the resources are all there.
For me, it's very important to make these easy to get.
We will also continue to do so.
These are farmers, electronic engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, urban planners.
On a platform, do what they're good at.
The team's getting too big.
It's my new experimental equipment that's starting to work.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
In this warehouse we're going to build a shelf like this.
You can see it now.
Take a look at this.
It also exists.
One growing green vegetables, one growing Ebola vaccine.
And what's great is that plants and this top-level research program of the United States Department of Defense are the reason why we're working on the Ebola virus.
These plants are producing proteins against the Ebola virus.
So medicine and health products, then let's go to lettuce cultivation.
But these two things seem completely different, and that's what I'm doing in my own field.
But many things are not what they were supposed to be.
And we're still at the stage of "we're right," and it's like, "This is my little black box -- "No, buy mine."
"No, no, no -- my intellectual property rights are absolutely valuable.
Don't buy this. Buy mine."
In fact, we're just at the beginning, and this time, society is changing.
When we want more, cheaper food, we need better, more environmentally friendly food.
But you see McDonald's ad advertising McNuggets, the most mysterious food in human history -- McDonald's's marketing program is changing -- everything is changing.
Now look at the world today.
Personal food computers, food servers, food data centres, operating in open-form groups.
Like open genomes, but we're going to put together a little climate recipe, like Wikipedia, that you can overturn, start, grow.
How does this look?
Do you remember that the world is connected by thin ropes?
It's starting to show up with bacon.
We started sending messages about food, not distributing food.
It's not just my fantasy, it's what we're already doing.
Food computers, food servers, fast food data centres, connect people to information sharing.
The future of food is not its fault.
We all know it's wrong there.
The food of the future is about connecting the next generation of 1 billion farmers, and empowering them with a question-and-answer platform, "if?"
Thank you.
Sometimes I'm very ashamed to be a European.
Last year, more than a million people came to Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, was pathetic.
There are so many contradictions here.
We mourn the tragic death of a two-year-old boy, Alan Cody, but since then, more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.
We have an international convention that recognizes the acceptance of refugees as a common responsibility of all nations, yet we accept a small Lebanon, receiving more Syrians than Europe as a whole.
We denounce the existence of human smuggling, yet we make it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe.
We have a shortage of labour, and yet we prevent those who can meet our economic and demographic needs from entering Europe.
We claim that our liberal values are contrary to the Islamic fundamentalists, yet -- we use a high-handed policy of detaining children as asylum-seekers, separating children from their families, forcibly confiscating refugee property.
What are we doing?
We're dealing with a humanitarian crisis in an inhumane manner.
I don't believe it because people don't care.
I think it's because our politicians lacked the vision to adapt to what they had proposed 50 years ago in order to cope with a changing and globalized world.
So what I'm trying to do is step back and ask two very basic questions that we all have to understand.
First of all, why isn't the current system working?
Second of all, how do we solve this?
The modern refugee system was created after World War II by these people.
It was meant to make sure that when a country collapses or worse, the regime is hostile to the people of that country, who can have a place to go and live there in safety and dignity until they can return home.
That's exactly what we saw today in Syria.
Through an international conference co-signed by 147 Governments 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the commitment of UNHCR, an international organization, to allow the entry of other persons into their territory from war and persecution among member States
But now, the system is collapsing.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policy stands in the way of a safe path.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek equal treatment or to choose to return to their homeland.
But in practice, they are trapped in a state of almost indefinite stagnation.
Theoretically, the problem of refugees is a shared responsibility of all States.
In real terms, geographical location means that the proximate countries are overstretched to receive the vast majority of refugees.
The rules of the old refugee system are not the cause of its collapse.
It's that we don't use it enough as the world changes. That's what we need to reconsider.
So I'd like to explain to you how the system works today.
How does the current refugee reception system work?
But it's not from top-down macro angles, it's from the perspective of the individual refugees.
So imagine a Syrian woman.
We'll call her Amira for the time being.
Amira represents the many refugees I've met in the region.
Amira, like about a quarter of the world's refugees, is a woman with children, and she can't go home because of her city, which you're seeing right now, the city of Homs, which was once beautiful and rich in history, is full of ruins.
That's why Amira couldn't go back.
Amira also had no hope of resettling in a third country because, like the middle lottery, less than one percent of the world's refugees had access to it.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first is that Amira can take her family to the camp.
In the camp, she might get help, but there's very little hope for Amira and her family.
Camps are in a barren, barren place, usually in the desert.
In the Zatalina camp in Jordan, you can hear shells crossing the Syrian border at night.
Economic activity there is limited.
The quality of education is generally low
And around 80 percent of refugees in camps around the world have to stay there for at least five years.
It's a sad place, and it might explain why, in reality, only 9% of Syrians chose this option.
Or Amira could go to a city in a neighboring city, like Amman or Beirut.
Seventy-five percent of Syrian refugees chose this option.
But even there, it's difficult.
Refugees in cities usually do not have the right to work
They usually don't have access to aid.
So when Amira and her family ran out of basic savings, they had nothing left, and they were likely to face poverty.
There's a third option, chosen by a growing number of Syrians.
Amira can find hope for her family on a dangerous journey that could bury her life to another country, and that's what we see today in Europe.
On a global scale, we leave refugees with an almost impossible choice of three options: refugee camps, urban poverty, and dangerous journeys.
For refugees, this is the current global refugee system.
But I think it's a wrong choice.
I think we can reconsider this option.
The reason we're limiting these options is because we think they're the only options available to refugees, but they're not.
Politicians have shaped it into a loss-and-loss problem, and if refugees get it, citizens have to pay for it.
We seem to agree with the assumption that refugees are an inevitable burden and cost to society.
But it's not a pattern. Refugees can make a contribution.
So what I'm trying to prove is that we have a way to increase that option and that it still benefits everyone: our host countries and communities, our society and the refugees themselves.
I'd like to suggest four ways to change our thinking about refugees.
There's one thing in common in all four ways that we all take advantage of the opportunities of globalization, social mobility and markets to update our understanding of the problem of refugees.
The first thing I want to think about is the concept of creating an environment.
I started a research project with colleagues from Oxford University in Uganda to study the economic life of refugees.
We didn't choose Uganda because it was a typical representative of the receiving country.
It's exactly the exception.
Unlike most of the world's host countries, what Uganda did was to give refugees economic opportunities.
Give them the right to work, give them freedom of movement.
The results are amazing, both for refugees and for host countries.
In Kampala, Uganda, we found that 21% of refugees run their own businesses and employ other people, 40% of their employees are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for the citizens of the host country.
Even in the refugee camps, we've found examples of dynamic, prosperous start-ups.
For example, in a refugee camp called Nakivale, we found Congolese refugees trading in digital music.
We found a business for Rwandan refugees that allows young people to play computer games on recycled manipulators and displays.
You're looking at a Congolese named Damon Kay.
When he arrived in the camp, he had no weight, but he wanted to be a movie maker.
So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a camera, and he's making a movie.
He's already made two documentary films, and our team, for our team, and he's got a successful career starting with a few resources.
That's exactly the case. It should guide our response to the refugees.
Instead of believing that refugees are inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we need to give them the opportunity to prosper.
Yes, clothing, blankets, shelter, food are very important in the emergency phase, but we have to think about it in the long run.
We need to provide connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, funding and commercial channels.
All the access we take for granted to the global economy can and should be provided to refugees.
The second idea I'd like to discuss is the economic zone.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have adopted Uganda's policy.
Most host economies are not open to refugees, but we still have effective alternatives.
Last April, I went to Jordan, together with my colleague, Development Economist Paul Kolya, where we discussed an idea, together with the international community and local governments, that would bring jobs to Syrians while promoting Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea is to create an economic zone in which we can combine the employment of refugees with the employment of Jordanian nationals in the host country.
Only 15 minutes away from the Zatali camp, where 83,000 refugees are housed, is an economic zone known as King Hussein's Development Zone.
The government has invested more than $100 million to connect the grid and the roads, but two things are missing, labor and foreign investment.
So what if the refugees were to be able to work there instead of being trapped in refugee camps, to be able to afford their families and develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria?
We realize it's good for Jordan, and its national development strategy calls for upgrading manufacturing as a middle-income country.
This will benefit the refugees and will also help Syria's post-war reconstruction by recognizing that we need to train the refugees as the best resource for the eventual reconstruction of Syria.
We put this in the foreign affairs journal.
King Abdullah of Jordan has also adopted the idea.
Two weeks ago, at the conference in London in Syria, it was announced that the pilot project would begin this summer.
The third idea I'd like to show is the preferred match between the state and the refugees, and in order to achieve this self-proclaimed happy ending, it's German Prime Minister Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We don't ask refugees what they want or where they want to go, but I'm saying it can be done for the benefit of everyone at the same time.
The economist Evan Ross created the concept of a match-to-market, which is that the order of preferences determines the final match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Erics Teterbone are looking at how to apply this concept to the solution of the refugee problem, and they are asking the refugees to sort the preferred countries, but at the same time allowing the countries to sort the categories of refugees they want to receive, based on criteria of skill or language, and then to match the two rankings.
Of course, you need to set quotas in terms of diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way to increase the likelihood of matching.
The idea of matching has been successfully applied, for example, to students and universities, to kidney donors and patients, and it also highlights the importance of algorithms in dating sites.
So why not use it to give refugees a better choice?
The biggest problem we face at this level is to convince local communities to accept refugees.
For the time being, for example, in my country, there's no reason why we often send engineers to remote areas and send farmers to cities.
So matching markets offer a potential way to match these preferences and reflect the needs and demands of the host people and refugees.
My fourth idea is a humanitarian visa.
Most of the tragedies and chaos we see in Europe are completely avoidable.
This stems from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy, as follows: in order to seek refuge in Europe, you have to make your own journey to Europe through a dangerous journey that I described earlier, but why are these journeys necessary?
In an era of cheap aviation and consulates?
These are completely unnecessary journeys that led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people at the European border and within Europe last year.
If refugees can travel directly to Europe and seek asylum, we can avoid these deaths, which can indeed be achieved through humanitarian visas, which allow people to get visas at embassies or consulates in neighbouring countries, and then buy their own tickets to Europe through cruise ships or airplanes.
It costs about a thousand euros to bring a stowaways from Turkey to the Greek Islands.
Two hundred euros is all it takes to fly from Bodrum, Turkey, to Frankfurt, Germany.
If we allow them to do this, it'll bring great results.
It saves lives, eliminates illegal smuggling markets, eliminates the chaos that we see on the edge of Europe, in areas like the Greek Islands.
The reason why we're stopping this program is politics, not rational solutions.
And it's an idea that has been applied.
Brazil first adopted this policy, in which more than 2,000 Syrians were granted humanitarian visas to enter Brazil and apply for refugee status at the time of entry.
In that plan, every Syrian was granted refugee status and confirmed to be a real refugee.
There's also a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as entry and exit documents allowing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to cross Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Nansen was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this viable response.
So I'm showing you four ideas in a way that we can add to the Amilla option.
To give refugees a better choice than to limit themselves to three basic, impossible options, as I said before, and to the benefit of all.
In general, we need a fresh perspective to increase the choice of refugees while recognizing that they are not necessarily a burden on society.
It's not a rule to become a refugee.
Indeed, refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they are also human beings with skills, talents and aspirations, capable of contributing to society if we allow them to do so.
In a new world, migration doesn't disappear.
What we see in Europe will last for many years.
People migrate, people leave their homes, and we need to find a rational and realistic way to manage -- not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid, not on the logic of charity, but on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets and mobility.
I hope everyone realizes that, and I implore our government officials to meet this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was a kid, I used to fantasize about the ocean.
They're colorful and dynamic, and they live in animals that look like extraterrestrials.
I imagined the giant sharks at the top of the food chain, and the sea turtles danced gracefully among the coral reefs.
As a photographer who moved from a marine biologist, I spent most of my career looking for places that were in my childhood fantasy.
As you can see, I've been risking water ever since I was a little girl.
But the first time I really dived into the water, it happened when I was 10 years old.
And I remember clearly now, when I drew water hard enough to reach a rusty spot, lying on the reef with a barrel.
And finally, I was able to get enough cannons, look up, find myself surrounded by fish, all kinds of fish, like rainbows.
From that day on, I was deeply in love with the ocean.
Over the past 40 years, I've had the privilege of exploring the most wonderful ocean landscape on Earth, contributing to the National Geographic and Save our Oceans Foundation.
I'm shooting to the size of a giant shark, small enough to move up your palm.
In the cold sea by the big Canadian bear rainforest, I've met humpback whales right next to me, and I can't forget the smell of fish in my mouth.
In the Mozambique Strait, I saw the green turtle's courtship.
Each and every one of us will affect the ocean and will be affected by it.
And I dreamed of the pure ocean as a child, and it's getting harder and harder to find it now.
They're shrinking in scope, and they're under increasing threat.
We humans have been at the top of the food chain on Earth, and I've seen them and recorded them with cameras.
For a long time, I thought only a shocking picture would alert my audience.
And, of course, that's a good idea, and that's what brings me back to where I came from.
I believe that the best way to make a difference is to spread love.
I feel like a bridge between humans and animals, and as a photographer, I have a rare opportunity to unmask the mysterious veils of animals and ecosystems hidden deep in the ocean.
If you didn't know something existed, how could you possibly love it and protect it?
And that's exactly the strength of our environmental photographers.
I've been to hundreds of different seas, but there's only a few images that I can never forget.
For the first time, I was struck by this scene almost 10 years ago, along the coast of South Africa.
In June and July of each year, countless sardines migrate northwards, what we call sardines.
Believe me, these fish have to do this.
Because there are groups of hungry, fast hunters chasing after them.
For example, collective hunting of dolphins, they separate a portion of the sardines from the fish stocks and bring them together into a spherical pattern.
Dolphins will drive these sardines closer to the surface and then rush into the herd to enjoy this moving feast.
This is followed by sharks.
Most people would think that sharks and dolphins are natural enemies, but in the sardines, they coexist.
In fact, with the help of dolphins, sharks eat better.
Without dolphins, sardines are hard to form, sharks often go through the middle of the herd, like donuts, sometimes only have a stomach of water.
I've had a few intimate encounters with sharks in the sardines, and I know sharks don't look at me.
But I'm still getting hit and swept up by the tail, just like all the other guests at this tumultuous feast.
We sailed east of the African coastline, across the vast Indian Ocean, to the Maldives -- an archipelago of coral reefs.
In the stormy southwest monsoon season, the devil fish living in the archipelagic waters gather near a small island called Hani Fallu.
Swarms of shrimp crabs, mostly smaller than our pupils, are the main food for the devil's fish.
When these plankton are scattered, the devil fish tend to eat alone, and they keep rolling backwards in the water, like little dogs chasing their tails.
And when plankton gathers more and more, the fish start to connect, grow up in a long dietary formation, and the venom of the plankton leaks will be eaten clean by the companions behind them.
As the plankton in the bay gathers more and more, the formation of the devil's fish gathers more and more, this unique way of preying, we call it "the whirlwind hunt."
The devil's fish are stacked up, lined up and rotated, forming a vortex, sucking up the plankton, going straight into the big mouth of the devil's fish.
Diving in the midst of hundreds of devil fish, that's what I'll never forget for the rest of my life.
When I first went to Hani Fallu to take a photo, it wasn't protected, and the environment was threatened by local developments.
In cooperation with NGOs like the Devil's Fish Trust, my photo eventually helped Hani Fallu to become a marine protected area.
The fishermen of the nearby islands, who had hunted many devil fish, used their skins to make traditional drums.
And now they're the strongest protectors of the devil fish, who bring more than $8 million a year to the Maldives.
I've always wanted to go back to the past, to the time when most of the maps were still blank, or to the time marked "There are dragons here."
So far, the most similar places I've been to are some of the remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean.
It's far away from the fishing grounds and fishing boats, where diving always makes me feel sad, because it reminds me of what the ocean used to look like.
Very few people have heard of Indian reefs, and it's a very small coral atoll, located in the Mozambique Strait.
The outer reefs form a protective barrier and the middle lagoon becomes a kindergarten for the Galapagos shark.
These sharks are never shy, even during the day.
I guess they'll be more lively at night, and they'll be more numerous.
I've never seen so many sharks in a coral atoll lake before.
To record and share this moment -- to remind me of the original purpose of choosing this path.
Earlier this year, in order to complete the contract for National Geographic, I came to California.
In the middle of the peninsula, on the Pacific side, sits on the lagoon of St. Ignacio, which is an important breeding ground for grey whales.
Over the past 100 years, this coastline has been a huge slaughterhouse, where more than 20,000 grey whales have been killed, with only a few hundred survivors left.
And now, the descendants of these gray whales will push their cubs to the surface, play games, even interact with us.
This species has recovered surprisingly.
On the other side of the peninsula is the corner of Pulmo, a quiet little fishing village.
Decades of overfishing once brought the village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the government to classify the area as a marine protected area.
What happens next can be described as a miracle.
In 2005, after only 10 years of protection, scientists found a record recovery in the number of local fish stocks.
You can see it. Come with me.
Take a deep breath, dive with me into the sea floor, and see what it looks like to be the largest and most dense fish I've ever met.
We are all capable of creating hope.
I want to send a message through my own photo, from now on, that it's not too late to save the ocean.
I'd like to pay particular attention to nature's resilience in the face of 7.3 billion human beings.
And I hope that in the years to come, it's going to be harder and harder for me to get a picture like this, but more pictures of people living in harmony with the ocean.
I wish I could take pictures like this every day.
To be famous in our business, you have to be a hopeless optimist.
I'm always taking pictures with this hypothesis, and the next great picture that can make a difference is waiting for me in front, maybe behind the next reef, in the next lagoon, or else, in the next lagoon.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
As soon as the new government emerged from the long war of independence, it announced a socialist policy to make health care and primary education a basic free project.
Large-scale rural health centres have allowed 80 per cent of the population to reach within two hours on foot.
25% of children were routinely immunized in the 1980 Zimbabwe Independence Year.
By 1990, just 10 years later, that percentage had risen to 80%.
I'm honored to be part of this transformation, this revolution.
Excited love and gay love are real.
I felt involved not only in an African independence movement, but also in a progressive global public health campaign.
I've faced some daunting difficulties, too.
In 1985, the year I arrived, Zimbabwe reported the first case of AIDS.
I took care of a few AIDS patients in the early 1980s when I was in Harlem Hospital for medical training, but... we had no idea what would happen in Africa.
When I first got there, the infection rate was about 2%.
When I left Harare 17 years later, there was one infection in every four adults.
By the mid-1990s, I told hundreds of angry young people that they tested positive for HIV.
I saw my colleagues and friends die, my students and hospital patients die.
Faced with this situation, I ran a clinic with my colleagues.
We'll show you how to use condoms.
We're in school, we're in the workplace, we're in school, we're in the middle of school, we're in the middle of school, we're in the middle of school, we're in the middle of school, we're in the middle of school, we're in the middle of school, we're in the middle of school, we're in the middle of school.
We're doing research and we're giving partners of people living with HIV advice on how to protect themselves.
We worked very hard to do all this, and I'm sure I did all I could at the time.
I offered the best treatment, at least under the prevailing conditions.
But I didn't make any constructive changes.
Former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, admitted frankly that it was his personal mistake that led to the massacre in Rwanda.
In 1994, he was the head of United Nations peacekeeping.
At the Ten-Year Memorial Ceremony of the Holocaust, he recalled that I believed I had done everything I could, but after the Holocaust, I realized that there was a lot more I could do and should do to ring the alarm and seek support.
The World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have died of the disease today, and many like me feel remorse and regret for not stopping it earlier.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't realize I was an advocate or a politician.
I thought it was because of my medical knowledge that I went there because of my clinical and infectious disease research.
I always thought it was my job to take care of patients, to get a better understanding of the demographic characteristics of the infection, and I hope it slows the spread of the virus.
I realized that the percentage of marginalized groups infected with and killed by AIDS was extraordinaryly high.
In sugar cane plantations, which are more like feudal territories than in modern businesses, 60% of pregnant women are tested positive for HIV.
My job is to show people that being infected isn't a moral failure, it's a male ideology related to forced labour and colonialism.
Most white people are safe and sound.
As medical experts, our methods are regrettably weak: begging people to change their personal behavior, using condoms, reducing the number of partners.
The infection rate is still on the rise as the most effective weapon in our fight against the virus, and when treatment is possible in the West, it's unaffordable for the public sector as a whole in Africa.
I'm not bold enough to say that inequality of access to life-saving medicines, or problems in potential economic and political systems, is the driving force behind high infection rates in such a large population.
I've made excuses for my silence, reminding myself that I'm just a visitor to this country who would be deported if the alarm was sounded and I couldn't do my job, take care of my patients, and do much-needed research.
So I didn't say anything to the government about the early AIDS policy.
I didn't say my worries were loud enough.
A lot of doctors, health workers, might think I didn't do anything wrong.
Our commitment to the patient, like the Hippocratic oath and its different versions, is a sacred medical relationship.
I've done everything I can for every patient I've ever had.
But I know that the infectious diseases that accompany the division of our society reflect not only biological phenomena, but also, more importantly, marginalization, intolerance, racial discrimination, gender discrimination, class discrimination.
For AIDS.
For the recent Ebola.
Medical anthropologists, like Paul Farmer, are working on AIDS in Haiti called structural violence: structural, because inequality is rooted in the political and economic organization of our social environment, often ignored by the elites of privilege and power; violence, because of its effects, such as premature death, suffering, disease, violence.
We do very little for the sick if we don't realize that these societies are unjust.
Ringing the alarm is the first step in the right direction to guide public health care, and this is the way we're looking for support, and we're going to break through, and we're going to create a real change.
So now, I'm not silent.
I've got a lot of things to talk about, even if it's uncomfortable for the listeners, even if it's uncomfortable for me.
It's a lot about apartheid and organized racism, things that shouldn't happen in this country, things that shouldn't exist in medical practice or in public health.
But they do exist.
That's why the alarm bells against racism, affecting health care in the United States continue to be organized, inter-human violence against colored people, linked to our tragic history, 250 years of slavery, 90 years of racial discrimination, 60 years of imperfect equality, and that's why the alarm bells are the focus of my work as New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York City, premature death, i.e. death before the age of 65, blacks are 50% higher than whites.
In 2012, black women faced more than 10 times the risk of maternal mortality compared to white women.
Although we've made great progress in reducing infant mortality, the first year of death after the birth of black babies is nearly three times as high as that of white babies.
New York City is not an exception.
These statistics are similar throughout the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reports about 15 million missing black males across the country.
The authors point out that at least one in every six black men between the ages of 25 and 54 disappears from their daily lives or dies in prison or prematurely.
It's very unfair for young blacks to face disproportionate violence on a daily basis.
But we need to remember the current state and results of general health care, and the persistently high rates of disease, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, diseases that slowly and quietly consume life, and diseases that cause more black lives to die prematurely.
As the "Black Life is Important" movement unfolded, I felt frustrated and angry that medical groups were hesitant to use the word "racist" in their research and work.
Every time I say it, you probably feel something.
Medical students wear white robes to protest against biological and chemical weapons, but medical groups are largely passive in the face of the effects of continuing racial discrimination on disease and mortality.
I'm worried that personalized and accurate drugs, searching for biological and genetic targets, and better-designed therapy, may inadvertently prevent us from seeing the big picture, which is the scene of everyday life where a person lives, grows up, works, loves a place that has an important impact on the health of the community, and for many of us, ill health.
In everyday life, as health workers, both in clinics and when doing research, we are witnesses of great injustice: the homeless, unable to comply with medical instructions, because he has to give priority to more urgent matters; the young transgender, planning suicide because our society is too ruthless; single mothers, forced to feel responsible for the ill health of their children.
As health workers, our role is not just to treat our patients, but to sound the alarm and advocate for change.
And whatever is right or wrong, our position in society makes our voice more credible, and we shouldn't waste it.
I'm sorry I couldn't be frank in Zimbabwe, and I've made a commitment to myself, as the New York City Health Commissioner, and I'm going to use all the opportunities I have to ring the alarm to get support for health equality.
I will speak out against racial discrimination, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you, when you speak out against sexism, or any kind of inequality.
It's time for us to stand up against structural inequality and speak up.
We don't need all the answers to advocate change.
All we need is courage.
The health of our patients, our own health, depends on it.
Well, I'd like to show you by raising your hand, how many people have ever blackened their friends on Facebook, because they've made inappropriate statements about politics, religion, children's rights, food, etc.
How many people at least have someone you don't want to see, because you just don't want to talk to each other?
You know, in the past, we wanted a polite conversation, and all we had to do was follow Henry Higgins' advice in Ladies: just talk about the weather and your health.
But these years with climate change and the campaign against vaccines -- it doesn't really work.
So, in the world in which we live, this conversation can develop into a world of debate, where politicians can't talk to each other, and even for those things that are grotesque, there's a lot of people who say yes or no, and that's not normal.
The Pew Research Center, in a survey of 10,000 adults in the United States, found that at this point in time, we have a sharper position than at any time in history.
We're less inclined to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other.
The decisions we make, the choices we make, the choices we make about where we live, who we marry and who we even make friends with, are based on what we already have.
Again, that means we're not listening to each other.
Talk needs to be balanced and listened to, and somehow, we're losing that balance.
Technological progress is partly a cause.
Smart phones, for example, are in your hands right now, or right next to them, and you can get it.
According to Pew's research, about one third of American teenagers send more than 100 text messages a day.
And a lot of people in the middle, almost all of them, tend to text their friends more than face-to-face conversations.
A great article in Atlantic magazine.
The author is Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
He gave his students an exchange mission.
I want to teach them how not to use notes to speak on a subject.
And he said, "I'm beginning to realize..."
"I'm beginning to realize that the ability to communicate is probably the most neglected of us, and that we don't have the skills to teach.
Kids spend hours a day touching creative and other partners through screens, but they rarely have the opportunity to discover their interpersonal skills."
It sounds funny, but we have to ask ourselves, "What skills are more important in the twenty-first century than keeping a consistent, confident conversation?"
Now, my job is to talk to people -- Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, governors, plumbers.
I talk to people I like, and I talk to people I don't like.
I'm talking to people at the personal level who don't really agree with me.
But I still have good communication with them.
So I want to use the next 10 minutes to teach you how to talk, and how to listen.
Many of you have heard countless suggestions, such as looking at each other's eyes, thinking in advance about interesting topics that can be discussed, looking, noding and smiling to show your focus, repeating what you just heard, or summing up.
I want you to forget all this.
It's all useless.
There's no need to learn how to express your concentration, if you're really focused.
I actually used the same skill as a professional interviewer in everyday life.
Well, I'm here to teach you how to interview people, which actually helps you learn how to be better communicators.
Learn to start a conversation, don't waste time, don't get bored, and, most importantly, don't offend anyone.
We've all had great conversations.
We've all been there, and we know what it feels like.
After that, you feel very enjoying, very encouraged conversation, or you think you have a real connection with someone else, or you get a full understanding of someone else.
There's no reason to say that most of your interpersonal interactions can't be that way.
I have 10 basic rules, and I'll explain one by one, but seriously, if you choose one and you know it well, you can already enjoy a happier conversation.
Article 1: Don't think twice.
I'm not saying just drop your phone, tablet, car keys, or whatever's in your hand.
I mean, right now.
Get into that situation.
Don't think about your previous fight with the boss.
Don't think about what you're having for dinner.
If you want to quit talking, quit talking.
Number two: Don't be a good teacher.
If you want to express your views, you don't want to leave any opportunity for people to respond, argue, argue or interpret, and write blogs.
There's a good reason why I don't have an expert lecture in my conversation, because it's really boring.
If he was a conservative, he would hate Obama, food stamps and abortion.
If the other was a liberal, it would hate big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
It's perfectly predictable.
You sure don't want that.
You need to get into every exchange and assume that you can learn something.
The famous therapist M. Scott Parker said that real listening needs to be left aside.
Sometimes it means putting your personal point of view aside.
He said that people who talk are becoming less vulnerable and sensitive, and therefore more and more likely to open up their inner world and present it to listeners.
Again, assume you need to learn something new.
Bill Ney said, "Every person you're about to meet has something you don't know."
Let me repeat: everyone's an expert in some way.
Third point: Use of open issues.
In this connection, please refer to the question-and-answer format of the interview.
Start asking questions with “Who”, “what”, “When”, “Where”, “Why” or “How”.
If you ask a complex question, you'll get a simple answer.
If I ask you, "Are you afraid?"
You'll answer the most powerful word in that sentence, "fear," and the answer will be "yes" or "no."
"Are you angry?" "Yes, I was angry."
Let the other person describe it, the other person is the one who understands the situation.
Try asking each other, "What's it like?"
"How do you feel?"
Because this way, each other might need to stop and think, and you'll get a more interesting answer.
Fourth point: Let it happen.
That is, ideas will naturally flow into your mind, and you need to express them.
We often heard the guest talk for a few minutes, and then the moderator came back and asked questions, which seemed to have come from nowhere or been answered.
That means the host might not have been listening two minutes ago, because he thought about this very clever question, and he thought about it.
We'll do the same.
When we sat with someone, we suddenly remembered that meeting with Hugh Jackman at the coffee shop.
And then we stopped listening.
The story and the ideas are always coming to you.
But even if it can't be stopped, don't let them stay too much in their minds.
Point five: If you don't know, say you don't know.
The people on the radio, especially on the national public radio station, know very well that their conversations will be broadcast out, so they'll be more careful about what they claim to be professional and what they're trying to carve out.
Learn to do this. Be careful.
The conversation should be about responsible behaviour.
Article 6: Don't compare your experiences with others.
If you talk about losing your family, don't start talking about losing your family.
If each other's talking about work trouble, don't tell them how much you hate your job.
It's different, never the same.
Any experience is unique.
And, more importantly, it's not about you.
You don't need to prove at this moment how capable you are, or how much pain you've suffered.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was, and he said, "I don't know. The people who brag about IQ are dicks."
Talking isn't about selling itself.
Article 7: Try not to repeat what you have said.
It's aggressive and boring, but it's easy for us to do it.
We wanted to make a point, and we kept saying it in a different way.
Come on.
Article 8: Cut the crap.
To be clear, no one cares about those years, names, dates and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so forth in your mind.
They're concerned about you.
They care what kind of people you are, and you have something in common.
So forget about the details.
Article 9: This is not the last one, but the most important one.
Listen carefully.
I can't tell you how many important people have said that listening may be the most important, first of all, that you can upgrade your skills.
Buddha said -- and I repeat, "If you keep your mouth shut, you can't learn anything."
Calvin Colliz once said, "No one's ever been fired because he heard too much."
Why don't we listen to each other?
First of all, we prefer to say it.
I'm talking while everything's under my control.
I don't have to listen to anything I'm not interested in.
I'm the focus.
I can strengthen my sense of identity.
But there's another reason: we'll be disturbed.
People say about 225 words every minute, but we can hear nearly 500 words every minute.
So our brain is occupied by this other 275 words.
I know it takes a lot of effort to really listen to people, but if you don't, you're not talking.
You're just two people in the same place yelling at each other has nothing to do with it.
You must listen to each other.
Steven Covey has a wonderful talk about this.
He said, "Most of us don't listen for understanding.
We listen in response.”
Finally, article 10: Concise and concise.
"Good conversation is like the right mini skirt; it's short enough to attract people, it's long enough to cover subjects -- my sister's metaphors" -- all of which are condensed into the same concept, that is, to be interested in others.
I grew up next to a famous grandfather, and my family was in constant contact with guests.
The visitors came before the meeting to talk to my grandparents, and when those people left, my mother would come and say to us, "Do you know who that is?
She's Miss America's Asian Army.
He's the mayor of Sacramento.
She won the Pulitzer Prize, and he's a Russian ballet dancer."
I've been growing up by default that everyone has an unknowing beauty.
Seriously, I think it made me a better host.
I try to talk as little as I can, but open my mind, always ready to be surprised, and I'll never be disappointed.
You can do the same.
Go out the door, talk to someone, listen to others, and most importantly, get ready for a big surprise.
Thank you.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Matthew Williams. I'm a champion.
I've won medals in three different games and in the All Canada Games, and I've been involved in an international basketball program, and I'm very proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I spend five days a week with top coaches and psychologists to train basketball and speed skaters to keep up the best game.
To add, it's all because of the Special Olympics.
Does that make any difference to you and to me and to my achievements?
The world doesn't see all people like me as champions.
Not long ago, people like me weren't meant to be seen.
Since the Special Olympics in 1968, this phenomenon has improved considerably, but in reality it is often seen that people with mental disabilities are often invisible compared to ordinary people.
People call me stupid in front of me and think I don't care.
They call me a fool. They call me a retard. It's a pejorative use.
They don't know how much it hurt me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here to get mercy.
I'm here because there's still this problem: there's a lot of people who have problems with the way they look at people with mental disabilities, or more, many people don't even recognize them.
You all know that the World Games were held this year, right?
I'm one of the 6,500 mentally handicapped athletes. We're from 165 countries in Los Angeles.
There were over 62,000 viewers watching the opening and TSN and ESPN were live.
But do you know about this?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
I'm here today to boldly propose that we be treated equally.
The special Olympic Games have changed the self-awareness of intellectually impaired athletes and the perception of the audience.
If you're not familiar with the Special Olympics, let me explain.
It's independent of the Paralympics and the Olympics.
We have high-quality, year-round sports projects for intellectually handicapped players that can change our fate and our perceptions.
The Special Olympics changed my life, changed the lives of a lot of people, and changed the world's perception of people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epileptic and intellectual defects.
I played hockey until I was 12.
The more you grow up, the harder it gets to keep up with someone else.
There was a time when I didn't get into any sports, and there wasn't a lot of friends who felt abandoned, nobody asked.
Once upon a time, the mentally handicapped were isolated from the public.
No one thinks they can go to sports, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at Toronto University, was studying the impact of normal sports on the health of mentally handicapped children.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers, through rigorous scientific research, have come to the conclusion that the reason for the decline in the health of children with intellectual disabilities is simply a lack of opportunity to exercise.
A lot of people question how people with intellectual disabilities can benefit from sports projects or sports competitions.
But it's because of Dr. Hayden and the founder of the Special Olympics, Younis Kennedy Sharif, who insisted on the benefits of the sport and the fact that no 4.5 million Special Olympics have proved that the sport is really good.
Before I went to the Special Olympics, I was a nervous man because I was young, shy, unconfident and not a lot of friends.
But when I got there, I found out that everyone was friendly, helpful, non-discriminatory, and made me myself.
Now, I'm a basketball player, and I'm a speed skater, and I've been in provincial and national competitions, and I've been at the Special Summer Olympics in Los Angeles this year, where I represent the first Canadian basketball player in the world.
I'm one of the 4.5 million athletes in the world.
Become a sportsman for the Special Olympics and help us regain our confidence and dignity.
The sport also points to important health needs.
Research shows that, on average, a man with a mental impairment lives 13 years less than a man without an intellectual impairment, and a woman with an intellectual impairment lives 20 years less than a woman without an intellectual impairment.
The Special Olympic Games kept us healthy, and we took the initiative to participate in the Games.
Our coaches teach us nutrition and health.
Special Olympics also provide free health check-ups for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctors or who have difficulty getting health attention.
At the Special Olympics in the summer of 2015, my Canadian team and I fought against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, Nigerian basketball team members took a health system check-up at the Games, seven of the 10 players were given free hearing aids, and for the first time, they heard better.
It's amazing what's happening to them.
They're more excited, happy, confident, because their coaches are finally able to communicate with them in language.
They're very excited because they can hear the sound of basketball, the sound of whistles and the cheering of the fans standing next to them, the voices that we think deserve to exist.
Special Olympics not only change athletes in sports.
It also changes athletes in their lives.
This year, research shows that close to half of the adults in the United States do not know that 44% of Americans who don't have contact with people with mental disabilities are much more intolerant and less aggressive.
And then the word "dumb" proves that the mentally handicapped are still invisible and feeling isolated.
People use that word, either say it or curse it.
Last year on Twitter, it was used more than nine million times, which deeply hurt me and 4.5 million athletes in the world.
People don't think it's a curse, but it is.
My athlete companion, and Global Messenger Franklin Stephens, wrote a letter to a political critic who used the word "stupid" to scold, "Look for a day at a special Olympic Games.
Let's see if you still have the same idea when you leave.”
This year, at the Special Olympics in the summer of 2015, people lined up for hours to watch the last night of the weight-lifting game.
When my teammate Jackie Barrett came up, they all stood up, called the Newfoundland moose, and he pulled up 665 pounds, and he crouched up and raised 611 pounds, and he made many new records for the Special Olympic Games.
Jackie was the record keeper in Newfoundland's re-election, not just in the special Olympics, but in all of them.
Jackie's a big star now in Los Angeles.
Fifty years ago, almost no one could have imagined that a person with a mental disability could do that.
This year, 60,000 viewers filled the famous L.A. Memorial Stadium, watched the opening of the game and cheered athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We're being congratulated and cheered, and we're not being hidden anymore.
Special Olympic Games teach athletes to be more confident and more proud of themselves.
The Special Olympic Games also taught the world that mentally handicapped people deserve to be respected and included.
Now, in my sports career, I have dreams and achievements, good training, respect, a healthier life, and I'm trying to move on to my private coach's career.
I'm not hiding. I'm being bullied. I'm doing TED Talk at TED.
With the special Olympics, the world is different, but there's still a long way to go.
So the next time you see someone with a mental disability, I want you to see their potential.
Next time someone's using the word "dummy" around you, I want you to tell them how hurtful it is.
I hope you'll want to see a special Olympics.
I'll share one last thought with you.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the ability to change the world."
The Special Olympics are changing the world, changing 4.5 million athletes, giving us a place to be confident, to know our friends, not to be discriminated against, and to experience being a champion.
Thank you!
You probably never heard of Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
But I think they're the best two places in the world.
The hospital there, a community of nurses, surgeons and scientists, has been silent for years against one of the most deadly threats to humanity -- the Lassa virus.
Lassa is very much like Ebola.
It can cause severe heat symptoms, and it's often fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day to protect every member of the community and, at the same time, all of us.
The best thing I've learned from them is that many years ago, when I first came to visit, those challenging days of fighting on the front, they started singing every morning.
They gather together to show their joy.
They showed a spirit.
Many years have passed, and when we visit each other year, I can sing with them, and we'll record them, and we love to do it, because it reminds us that we are not just searching for the scientific truth together, but that there is a human bond that binds us.
And you can imagine that when things change around you, this connection becomes extremely important, even indispensable.
In March 2014, a dramatic change took place, with an Ebola outbreak in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, at the border between Sierra Leone and Libya.
The situation is terrible, and we are all shocked.
In fact, at one point we even suspected that the spread of Lassa and Ebola was wider than we thought, and we were worried that one day it would spread to Kenema.
So my team immediately left, and then went there and joined Dr. Humal Khan and his team, and we set up diagnostic equipment to do some sensitive molecular tests, and we could detect it when the Ebola virus crossed the border with Sierra Leone.
We've already set up this size of equipment for the Lhasa virus, and we know how to deal with it, and this team is amazing.
All we have to do is give them equipment and space, and let them study Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the maternity ward of the hospital, and our team conducted these important molecular tests and diagnosed the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
That's really great.
They can diagnose the first cases, treat the patients safely, and start tracking the contacts, following the spread of the cases.
It could have stopped something.
But when that day came, the outbreak had been under way for months.
After finding hundreds of cases, it dwarfs all previous outbreaks.
And the virus wasn't attacked by that single case in Sierra Leone, it was a huge shock wave.
We have to work closely with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, and with Kenema locally, to deal with these cases, and the next week we have 31 patients, then 92, and then 147 -- all of them coming to Kenema, because this is one of the few places in Sierra Leone that can deal with the epidemic.
We're working day and night, trying our best to help every patient, hoping to get your attention, but we're doing another simple thing at the same time.
To detect the Ebola virus, we took samples from the patient's blood, and of course we could just throw them away.
But the other thing that we can do, in fact, is to put chemical drugs in the sample and make it work, and then to put it in a box, and to move it across the ocean, and that's what we do.
We sent samples to Boston, where my team works,
We also worked day and night, working on shifts every day, so we quickly sorted out 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This is a blueprint -- the genome of the virus is a blueprint.
We've got it on humans, too.
It details everything that makes up our body, tells us a lot of information.
The results of these efforts are simple, but also strong.
And we can take these 99 different mutations of viruses, and we can look at them and compare them, and we can see clearly that, compared to the three genomes released on the Guinean side, we can see that the disease began to spread in Guinea a few months ago, and once it breaks into the crowd, it spread quickly through human-to-person contact.
This information is really important, especially when you're studying how to block the spread of the virus, but the most important thing is to track the contacts.
And we can also see that when the virus spreads between people, it's changing.
And every kind of variation is so important, because all the diagnostics, vaccines, and the treatments we use are basically based on specific genome sequences, which are the root causes of the spread of the epidemic.
So health experts around the world have to respond quickly, to improve research methods, to adjust everything they do.
But as far as I'm concerned, the way that scientific research is done is that I've got the data, and I'm probably going to be locked up in the lab for months, and I'm going to analyze the data carefully, and I'm going to put it out, and I'm going to change it, and I'm going to make it public.
That was the current state of scientific research at the time.
Well, it sure didn't work that way at that particular time, did it?
Some of our friends work on the front line, and obviously what we need most is outside help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did, the genetic sequences came up from the machine, and we immediately posted them online.
We open it to the world, and we say, "Help us!"
So it helped to follow.
We haven't responded yet, and there's a lot of people around the world that have come to us, and they're surprised to see the data coming out online.
Some of the world's best viral trackers suddenly became part of our team!
We work together in this virtual way, we share information, we talk to each other, we keep in touch, we hope to track the spread of the virus in seconds, and we find a way to contain it.
Actually, there are a number of ways we're going to form such a group.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic breaks out around the world, keeps getting information, getting involved, getting involved.
Everyone wants to make some contribution.
The power of all the people in the world is truly amazing, and the Internet connects us.
Can you imagine that we're no longer afraid to communicate with others, and all of us say, "Let's get to work.
Let's work together. We can do this."
But the problem is that the data we all use, the data we find on Google, are far from meeting the needs of our work.
When this happens, we miss a lot of opportunities.
So in the early days of Kenema's outbreak, we had 106 clinical records of patients, and we made them public again.
In our own lab, you bring us 106 records, and we get computers to predict the next Ebola patient, and the accuracy is close to 100 percent.
We've also made an application to publish these predictions so that health professionals around the world can have access to this information.
However, 106 reports were far from sufficient, and that approach could not be made effective.
So we're waiting for more clinical reports to release that software.
These reports have not been forthcoming.
We're still waiting, and we're still working on the software, and we're sitting in the lab instead of working with you.
This is truly unacceptable to us.
Right? You, all of you, can't accept it.
Now is the time for life.
But the truth is, a lot of people have died, a lot of people in the medical field, including my dear colleagues, with five colleagues: Mbalu Vonny, Alex Mubi, Dr. Hummel Khan, Alice Covemar, and Muhammad Fuller.
It's just five of the millions of health workers who have died in Kenema and elsewhere, and the world has been waiting, and we've been working, and we've been working, and we're all independent and we don't communicate.
The Ebola virus, like all other threats to humanity, is exacerbated by mistrust, fragmentation and isolation among people.
And when we build barriers and fight each other, the flame of the virus gets even bigger.
But Ebola is not like any other threat, because this time, we're a family.
We are all on the same front.
One person with Ebola, we'll probably be next.
So we live in the world, with common weaknesses, common advantages, common fears, common hopes, and I sincerely hope that we can work together with joy.
One of my graduate students read a book on Sierra Leone, and she found the word "Kenema," the name of the city, the hospital when we were working in Sierra Leone, in the local Mende, which means, "Truth as a river, clear as a river, and everyone's eyes can be touched."
It's very far-reaching for us, and we're not aware of it ourselves, but we've always felt that in order to pay tribute to Kenema, to all the people where we've fought, we have to be open to cooperation, we have to share information, we have to move forward together.
We have to do this.
That's how all should ask themselves and others -- when a disaster breaks out, we should open our hearts to each other and fight together.
Because this isn't the first outbreak of Ebola, and it won't be the last, and there are many other microbes around us, like the Lhasa virus and other creatures.
The next time a disaster happens, it could happen in a city of millions of people, and it could break out there.
The virus may spread through the air.
The virus may even be deliberately spread out.
I know it's scary, I understand, but I also know that this experience tells us that we have the technology and the ability to win this war, not only to win this war, but to do everything else.
But we can do it only if we work together in good faith, and we have to be happy.
So for Dr. Khan, and all those who died on the front line of the fight against disease, who fought with us forever, let's fight with them forever.
Our world should not be defined by the devastation caused by a virus, and we will let billions of hearts and minds unite and cooperate in the earth.
Thank you.
