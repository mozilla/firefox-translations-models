Is there a way to punish him?
So as not to happen again.

Zhejiang University academic annual meeting students singing the protagonist research results make people's brains open-Xinhua
Use the air to wash your hands, judge the disease with a hustle, and accurately search for the source of smog Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these results are students, the research covers the environment, machinery, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities education and other major fields, students from a curious idea to create a lot of high-end inventions with application value, some of which have been awarded in the country.
Biosensors: Your Family Medical Examiner
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed off a smartphone-side biosensor on the spot, half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to breathe in a gentle breath, this set of instruments can be from the gas composition you exhaled, the initial detection of physical health."
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart bracelet that can detect health conditions on the market generally detects physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
The biosensor uses graphene, a new material, its target is chemical elements, and the keen "smell" allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical lights: doctors' high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won the Silver Award at the 44th edition of the Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions in Switzerland.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, masters students of the School of Optoelectronics Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgery without shadow lamps.
"Many diseases early detection, removal is not in place, related to the doctor's operating room with the lamp."
Shen Junfei said that for example, when the cancer is examined early, if the doctor can not see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp plates, which enhance the difference between different tissues in light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, degree of light, spectra, color uniformity, and no shadow rate at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been trialed in hospitals such as Shaw Hospital, affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical School, and Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing your hands with air: saving water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, wipe some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, and Li Qizhang and other students have invented a "air hand-washing device".
As long as we stand on the handwashing desk, our weight can compress the air out.
“It’s like a pinch.
The compressed air forms fluids at the faucet, and water is combined.
That way, we can wash our hands clean!"
Color rendering reactions and bacterial residue experiments have shown that the effect of hand washing through this method is the same as the ordinary method of hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, which can not only ensure the degree of washing, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Summit for Grand Challenges, the invention was the only gold award among the world’s top universities.
Please make up for me as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel the order and return the cash, do not point, will not use #PRS_ORG#! again!
Bone and spicy kimchi are not suitable for children to eat
If so, please order as soon as possible.
Not for the time being, thank you.
He told me to tell you where he was. #PRS_ORG#
I'm not waiting, cancel the order.
I bought #PRS_ORG# but I wrote the wrong address
Can it be changed?
Or cancel the order.
Okay, so trouble.
A certificate that makes sense – first aid.
This is one of the skills certificates that I feel is important in addition to my driver’s license!
Popularize it: First aid measures are actually emergency rescues in the event of emergencies, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is still a period of time in the process of ambulance after the accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.
This is when you need first aid.
If I really had a heart attack, a cerebral hemorrhage, a sudden respiratory arrest, then the window of our lives is only four minutes, and the golden four minutes are gone!
People around you know how important first aid is!
When someone falls down around us, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, rather than standing there stupidly standing there and not doing anything, this feeling of helplessness is too terrible.
“In China, our official data shows that three million people die unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In the casino hotel in Las Vegas, 780 percent can be saved, and Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.”
This is what the founder of the first reaction, Lu Le said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, breathing is gone, a heartbeat is gone, and you have no effect in strangling.
It is necessary to do artificial breathing and chest compressions to save people.
I find that very few people today have this awareness to learn first aid, but when it happens, it is too late, so I still urge everyone to learn this skill so that we can react in time in the face of sudden situations.
It could save a person’s life!
First aid can be registered at your local Red Cross training center, I am registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students have benefits.
PS: The last picture is to record the goal you want to accomplish before the age of 25, and adding the first aid certificate to the target list is also a few months ago, but it is indeed completed!
Then go to the other want to test the certificate, intend to go to the diving certificate, before the small red book to see there is a diving first aid certificate, the test seems to have an first aid certificate to go to the test, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
One of the $13 shrimp dumplings is one!
Never tried.
Why #NAME# doesn't understand?
One for $13?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed the food, this time a shrimp dumpling for me to eat!
Because obviously I found it valid when I typed the code before.
First of all, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a full-scale rotten film, in all senses.
But you have to say that this film is not a highlight or not, and that is not at least the soundtrack selection is very good.
There are many kinds of rotten pieces, so that you can fall asleep in the cinema is a kind, so that you can see the indignation after reading it is also a kind, "four seas" for the audience is like a monkey on the mountain, it can use countless ways to ignite your anger.
In this insult to the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creature in a gram-based novel, indescribable, and more like a windbreaker on the body of a small horse.
Even after reading it, you will doubt whether there is a metaphor implicit by the director, but when you think about it carefully, it is actually a piece of shit.
Let me start with some of the things that I find difficult to understand.
The man's residence should be on a small island in the south, and his grandmother depends on each other.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then arranged for a gentleman in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
Elderly people take a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father were very relieved.
Then the old man was not there.
In the abandoned ship to open the hotel, the female brother how to get a business license?
Why can the small bus party on the island easily close a mountain road?
Then the truck that sent steel bars in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not find it around.
The feeling of the tool is also very obvious.
Why did a small mixed-freight flying party that failed to do credit and suspected of illegality become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury why not call the police, the police in the film also asked whether there is any difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to not find a hotel owner, and sits outside the door of the room to sleep for a night.
This inexplicable plot is rife throughout the film, and it hurts me to remember them because the plot is so outrageous.
In addition to the plot, it is worse than the main theme of the film, or this film has no theme at all, which is a detestable suture.
At the beginning of the film you will think that he wants to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guessed that it may be a motivational film, look half of it you think it may be a plot that wants to reflect the survival of the young people in the town, after watching it, you do not know what you have seen, followed by deep doubts about yourself, why do you run to the cinema to enjoy shit in the New Year.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various films, such as if you want to clap a motorcyclist, then motivational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie is going to be successful step by step.
If you want to make a love film, then you are honest about the entanglements between the small town youth who like to ride motorcycles and the waiter sister.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot can’t be at odds with the normal world.
(For example, the new motorbike that Yin Zheng performed had just been burned, and then they could still sing, and he could not open some brain holes that even Kennedy could not see.)
As for the fact that the woman is obviously not mentally retarded and can perform in some ways is like a five-year-old child, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
I also don’t understand why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add a crash plot to his own movie?
Such a film is arranged in the Spring Festival file, is it to add plugs to the audience?

South African doctor: Omikron is strong, but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new coronavirus Omikron variant is more mild than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
As the Omikron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of the new crown patients they currently treat are mild, such as physical pain and cough similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the group’s director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patients need to be hospitalized.
“They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation,” Pillay said.
This includes older patients and those with health problems, he said, who would have been more likely to get seriously ill with coronavirus infection.
He said that in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, he said, the new crown patients he treated had “difficult breathing and low blood oxygen levels.”
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days.”
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omikron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will be weeks before enough data is collected, the doctor’s observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of the new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks are serious, half of the severity of the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent new crown patients have died, while in the early outbreak cases in South Africa, the proportion of deaths has reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute for Health Research, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports that “at present, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease.”
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get late-stage data.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths occur late, and we enter this wave of the epidemic for only two weeks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are looking at the number of cases and hospitalizations while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world’s leading strain of the new coronavirus, cases in Omikron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the centre of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases detected in Gauteng province in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests show that more than 90% of cases of the Omikron variant are reported.
Thanks to today’s supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Review: What to do to save abducted children?
If the analogy "no sale and no killing" of the famous public service slogan, then, in the good environment without "revenue" demand, group prevention and group governance, the whole people anti-abduction, so that the trafficking behavior is not profitable, the risk is large, the cost is high, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched the emergency release platform for the development of child disappearance information.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the dissemination of information on children's disappearances and timely recovery of abducted children.
I heard that this app is called "reunion", and I feel warm.
New technology means not only the name "art", full of feelings, and the use of information is appropriate, practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list a lot of "big words".
However, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims before the trafficking case is solved.
Under the urgent purpose of "seeking rescue", such as "whether children should be killed in all the death penalty" and other controversial topics, they can be temporarily put down and discussed carefully; but the matter of rescuing abducted children is not allowed.
According to the experience of such cases, traffickers are accustomed to staying away from the crime site as soon as possible after they have obtained their hands.
If the abduction action is delayed by one minute, the child may be more far from the parents, and the difficulty of the investigation of the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to take out an effective way to directly help solve cases and recover children such as the "reunion" platform.
After all, "abduction" is a big task that needs to operate the entire legal system.
Combating crime, protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the carefulness of law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "guarding the young and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from family to society, can do better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at the train station, and the parents slept soundly and woke up to find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, it should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
Both parents take turns to rest, or put their children under safe protection, are the minimum means of preventing the abduction of children.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking, the purchase of abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of our Criminal Law, the statutory penalty point for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it may be imposed on the death penalty and property shall be confiscated.
Under the general trend of "lightening punishment", the crime of child trafficking is obviously a more serious crime.
However, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people's concept of raising children is backward, and the legal awareness is weak.
The legal education of this part of the people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely on strict official law enforcement alone.
If the "market" of abduction is widespread, the traffickers are interested in their hearts, and they continue to innovate the means of trafficking, forming a "fight" situation with law enforcement, the abduction action is bound to fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness and popularizing legal common sense also help to root out the crime of trafficking and the sale of children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into five categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil.
Drought olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained by taking mechanical cold pressing, filtration and other treatments directly from fresh olives.
Depending on the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin is the highest level and highest quality olive oil and is a natural product.
Excellent taste, there are light and pleasant plants fragrant, acidity of not more than 1%.
High-quality virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, pure taste, aromatic.
Ordinary virgin olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): taste and flavor, the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining the virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or becomes a "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to reconcile taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5% and a transparent pale golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil extracted from the oil slag by dissolution and refined.
Having seen the grade classification you should have found, the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olives are like wine-making grapes, and olives from different regions and different olive varieties produce different standards of olive oil.
The best growing ground for olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has climatic conditions such as the most suitable soil and temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation required for the growth of olive oil.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be grown sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., similar to its climate, have far south latitudes in Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on.
Month of olive oil picking:
From March to June of each year, it is the time when the olive tree blossoms and sits on the fruit, and from July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the fruit picking season (the freshness of olive oil can be very important.)
Nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition in the oils found so far.
The Democracy Summit Ended, Biden Says the Fire of Freedom Never Goes Out
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, ended Friday.
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in Britain, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said: "We know how hard the work before us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Despotism can never extinguish the fire of freedom, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of society as a whole.
“As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent governance of accountability, the power to be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good,” he said.
The next day of the Democracy Summit will be to defend human rights, to consolidate democracy and to confront authoritarianism, and to counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the same day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces global challenges, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
“The time has come to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It is also necessary to firmly condemn all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Speaking at the summit in a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong reminded participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, including Hong Kong and Uighurs and Tibetans.
"The world has long accepted China's rise, but it has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use all that we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority.”
Luo also called on the free world to unite against the CCP’s threats.
"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values," he said.
And that’s why we failed.
That’s why we have to change.”
Tang Feng, a member of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, was presented at the roundtable discussion of "Cracking Down on Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values", and released the "State Statement" by video, emphasizing that Taiwan is on the front line of the fight against autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in fighting the new coronavirus epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"As Taiwan's democracy is on the rise, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to close the city to control the epidemic, do not have to take off the shelves can defeat false information."
As the “Democracy Summit” scheduled the next day, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, which have been found guilty of serious human rights violations, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to help with human rights violations.
I took a photo and uploaded it to you.

Hello, the spoof chicken brought by the restaurant is raw.
Want to try tennis, but afraid that you can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price exerciser first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if not distinguished, then the normal situation of expensive will be more friendly than cheap pat, this kind of "entry shot" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very low in strength, the ball hits the top of the beat, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can not stand, and the master is difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, you know that you can't learn, and you know that you don't want to buy expensive, make a bargain to fool you, you play twice, you won't fight again, so this beat is cheap, you don't hurt.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have made progress, and when you come back to me to buy expensive, I make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prence, or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets can not sell the price, the new 500, 600 is very good, second-hand 200, with a thousand yuan to enjoy the enjoyment of not smelly?
It is very friendly to newcomers, but as soon as they pass the novice stage, most people, especially girls, can't get through the novice stage.
Orders have been delayed multiple times.
Can you please help follow up?
Postponed
thanks
Do I actually have a credit?
Do I need to re-order the order? does it bother to do it?
Hello, ordered the food of this restaurant, but the food sent is missing a lot, and the spit chicken is also raw.

A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl Gandang's 'strive target' for sister's fundraising" blew up the circle of friends.
The photo shows that a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a large wooden board slightly higher than a person, and the words "human meat target, ten yuan and one arrow" are written on the board, indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows to shoot after payment.
This behavior has caused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the head of the publicity department of the Lower City Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such excessive acts for her sister's fundraising, but this behavior was not worth promoting, and after warning, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girl's street 'story target' fundraiser is warned
In the online picture, a long-haired girl is standing in front of a large wooden board, the board is written in black ink with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan an arrow", she is in front of another piece of wood board written its bank account with WeChat, Alipay account and so on.
The image was controversial after the Internet.
Some netizens believe that this is a "begging behavior", and many netizens sympathize with it.
"We were about 10 a.m. on the 23rd patrol to the side of the square when the situation was found, when the onlookers have been a lot of people."
In an interview with local media, the police of the Tianshui police station near the incident said that there were two girls at the stall, all about 20 years old, dressed up as young and beautiful.

He said that in the whole process, two girls were a target, one was responsible for playing hands, but did not participate in it, and no one was shot in the whole process, but someone onlookers and took photos on Weibo.
After the police were identified by the public security department, the use of bows and arrows did not fall under the control category.

What’s the best fire of 2021?
There is no doubt about the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
Some time ago, there was a "Look! Project Manager can impact the gold medal Olympic project" article is very hot, which mentioned that the project managers in many projects, is absolutely one horse can be the first, no one can do: moving bricks, business travel, staying up late is the project manager's daily, fire, back pot, apology is not the answer.
Seemingly a joke funny article, but also said the project manager's daily bitterness, behind the representative of the current project management work is powerless.
People who are engaged in project management have gradually chosen to get rid of their work through some actions.
Judging from the number of PMP (Internationally Accredited Project Management Professional Qualifications) who climb each year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management capabilities.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019)" said: As of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed the PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is not advisable to do things by simply copying the past "old experience", and the rapidly changing working environment let us know a way to learn and stand on the shoulders of the scientific giant to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure that the project management work is unimpeded?
Many project management beginners said that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically grasp the top ten areas of project management and the five major process groups and other relevant knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following questions: project management awareness is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, work can not land, project estimation is not accurate, the control sensitivity is poor, the project is delayed; member division of labor is not clear, the team of "old oil" does not know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance ...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, has helped many outstanding enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R & D talents, and won the honorary title of "Chinese enterprises R & D management talent training demonstration base" and other honorary titles of Zhongtian Huaxia consulting with the "R & D project manager special training camp" online course.
"R & D Project Manager Training Camp" online course This is an online fragmented learning way, combined with many R & D-type enterprises to fight the case, tools and methods, to help you master the project manager's knowledge and standard action, on the road of their own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment, promote the training process of project managers, and bring efficient operational results to enterprises.
Speaking without help, you can first see how other students evaluate this course: this course is not only by the team of experts in Zhongtian Huaxia (formerly Huawei R & D management team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprises real business scenarios, the content of the course in-depth professional explanation.
It will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and a rich template form to help students use the content they learn into into specific work after class.

In the past many years, Jiexin has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has carefully guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as launching innovative practice competitions with top domestic universities, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, rationally plan consumer demand, and thus help them accumulate wealth in life.

Vietnam People's Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council to tackle common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017 that led to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a full embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait towards “unity and stability.”
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in restoring relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar stemmed from the demand that countries must unite for the benefit of their countries and regional stability, and aim to meet common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long passage linking the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from both countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with Iran's warring with world powers in talks to salvage the Iran nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, a deal that Gulf Arab states have denounced as unable to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf states have always viewed Iran as a long-term “competitor” and Iran’s nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf states see the lack of a solution to the Iranian missile issue and the failure to take action to curb Iran’s activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia has held direct negotiations with Iran in the context of the failure of major powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic contribution to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in order to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.
From 7 o'clock to 9:30 p.m., the deposit must be returned and the order has been cancelled.

The new mountain super run exhaust sound is the largest!
This car that our team brought to everyone this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of nearly two million, a year of road tax marts ten thousand, four-wheel drive, why called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, how fast can you imagine?
That small series does not know, the data said 0-100km / h acceleration only 2.9 seconds, probably is the small series of myvi to 30km / h when people to 100km / h, well.
The low body, the clamory of the scissors door, the huge air intakes around the body and the glass-unspecified 6.5 v12 engine perfectly illustrate Lamborghini’s style.
For the description of the car does not need to say too much, their own Google as a good ass, small series to sort out some of the explanations that Google does not necessarily give!
Too much attention, to go where everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (in fact, a little cool)
1km of oil money at RM1 (carers don’t care at all)
Get in the car and practice it, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because you will not climb out of the cabin and then get stuck in half)
The engine is so loud that it gets deaf when you get out of the car. (but still cool)
The body is too big, parked in the ordinary parking space will be very narrow, very afraid to be knocked when the next car opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (small series of their own, has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video is not for sale, sorry!
For those who want to shoot video for your car, please contact us!
More information about the car you don't know about the car is in The Car Guide / People's Car Journal
A car accident worth a million dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that the Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the Porsche 911 is also priced in millions!
That day, in just a few minutes, foreign countries hit the million sports car 911 and tens of millions of supercars Chiron!
Look at the results, it makes sense!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of development for a long time, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university is crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first modern university, the university shouldered the unique mission of different from other social organizations, for China's universities, the rise of the national crisis of the autumn, its spirit is deeply influenced by the traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the "Ming Dejishi, Xiu Qijiping" value concept and "sucching a strong country" patriotism.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, education competition, scientific and technological competition, and talent competition are increasing worldwide, and the cause of higher education is on the "supply side" as an important "supply side", and its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for the Coordinated Promotion of World-class Universities and the Construction of First-class Disciplines" shows the confidence and determination of China to move from a big country of higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to rank among the world's first-class ranks in a short period of time, and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and realize "curve overtaking"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability and self-confidence, universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the advantages of post-development, through the continuous introduction of outstanding overseas academic talents, learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and quality of running schools; second, cultural advantages, inherit the wisdom connotation of Chinese civilization in the accumulation of 5,000 years, carry forward the development of excellent traditional culture, in order to unite the scale, shape the brand, enhance the image; third, the system advantages, give full play to the institutional superiority of the socialist country.
In particular, we must realize that the construction of world-class universities is impossible, and each school must show its personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school must not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in the running of the school: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurship talent training, build an integrated education environment of scientific and educational integration and school-enterprise integration, and form a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; the other is to highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary intermization, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create a system environment for interdisciplinary disciplines, actively cultivate interdisciplinary disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; third, highlight the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the common values of "studying hard, learning, discernment, and solidity" and "Heina River, Qizhen virtue, pre-civilian people, and tree country" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, and constantly accumulate cultural height and condensed spiritual strength, which is rich in content and far-reaching.
Among them, the "Hena River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the "world's talents for my use" mind, showing the high-quality concept of learning from the world's famous schools; "Qi Zhen Houde" emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and goodness, which refers to the university's pursuit of truth at the same time, but also to receive the virtue of the cultivation and personality of the Confucian; "the people of the people" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, both including the new spirit of knowledge, and the development of scientific research.Dedication is that the university should always be honored with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year-old school.
"The wise hear the silence, and the wise see the invisible."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the orientation of the era and the historical mission of the higher education cause, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation will stir each other, so as to provide inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

Seeing a news about the stock price of friends, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises on the track, that is, the choice of investment target industry, first of all to choose a large growth space of the industry, at least 100 billion market size; secondly, to choose a future growth of good industry, consider the next 3-5 years after the industry growth to achieve the best state of the industry; finally, to choose a policy support of the industry.
How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Take care of the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is “do the things right,” that is, do things right.
The strategy is “do the right thing.”
Strategy is to find direction, tactics are landing, and on most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) on top of the current field, you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or horizontal area extension (strategic thinking); for example, on the increase in customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on the promotion of activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right activity KPI, to achieve the right activity goals, such as improving the target customer participation, activating high-value silencers, precision to improve the current growth.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin has reached several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small Central American country, designated Bitcoin as legal tender, the first time Bitcoin has become a legal tender in a country or region.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination at three Ivy League schools, including Yale
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23 to protest against three pre-Ivy League schools, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College, who discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission conditions of famous schools in the United States has increased exponentially in the past 10 years, but in the three elite U.S. schools, the proportion of Asians has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities have "long-term continuity and systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" enrollment process.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among the three colleges and universities, Asians have the lowest acceptance rate among all ethnic groups compared to the number of applicants.
U.S. Department of Education data also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest rate of acceptance of Asian-American students in all Ivy League schools, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua that after they expect to submit their complaints, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice can investigate and take measures to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their enrollment.
They also expect the colleges and universities who have complained about to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their enrollment policies for Asians.
At present, the three colleges and universities that have been complained of have not yet responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015 to complain about Harvard’s admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups, the complaint also includes American-Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing agent that a factory building in Yuyao Zuting Town, Zhejiang Province, and after looking at the house at the scene many times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the plant.
In December of the same year, after consultation with Lin Mou, the family of the owner of the house, after consultation on the details of the purchase of the factory, Mr. Lu made a deposit of 200,000 yuan through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin Mou signed as the recipient on the "Prototyp Trade and Purchase Dending", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this plant, the deposit is returned to the seller, if the seller is not willing to sell the plant, the deposit will be double returned to the seller, and the two parties have agreed to sign a contract for the sale of the plant within one week."
However, since then, the two sides have not reached an agreement on the terms of the main contracts such as the scope of sale and payment methods of the plant, resulting in the delay in signing the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
It was difficult to look at the house, the deposit was paid, the house was ready, and the "one foot at the door" was signed, and the seller did not sell it, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the two sides ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, can not only be attributed to the defendant, should be reasonably presumed to be consultation failed, so the case should not apply the deposit penalty, the defendant does not have to bear double the liability for breach of contract.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original sentence.
[Lawyer Reminder] To do the necessary duty of care in the course of the transaction.
When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to do the necessary prudential care obligations, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and clarifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leadership Summit on Democracy", which "draws ideological lines, instrumentalizes and weaponizes democracy, and acts as an anti-democratic reality in the name of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and deflecting domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated a 'color revolution' with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for U.S. intervention in other countries.
The summit is an action for Biden to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held by video, with the leaders of 111 countries around the world invited to attend, including those of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States with problems with the United States' own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to preside over such a summit.
There have also been questions at the international and U.S. levels, such as criticisms of leaders who have been invited to attend, including leaders of authoritarian tendencies, such as those in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who have questioned the Biden administration’s real intention not to organize the summit for democratic but for geopolitical purposes.
German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is sick, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial contradictions, and the division of rich and poor," and that American democracy is a "game for the rich" based on capital.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, the power to withstand authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public good," Biden said in his speech.
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. "We must constantly update it in every generation, which, in my opinion, is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "require a champion to defend democracy in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges."
The United States has pledged to launch a one-year campaign following the Democracy Summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems ahead of the entity democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
"Let all of us implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year," Biden said.
Okay, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.

[Mint] environment: medium rule [service bell] service: fast "Old Famara cake" my must order Mala cake too soft too soft to eat 😋 like dessert small partners must try "East River ink fish brewing tofu" soup is very delicious Tofu very tender ink...
Taste like meat good service enthusiasm
Long time no time to come to the sun, fruit fishing is still so good to drink & real material, the first time to order fork burning bag, is my love of soft flour southern taste!
Cooking rice dry and wet degree is just right, the weight is very sufficient, the signature tin paper chicken wings are as praised as always, the soup is also good, and the mustard is also more than enough to handle.
Tasted service warm meat good
The old shop of Ōchang was also the existence of net red many years ago, the small building in the east, the wooden floor.
It always takes a long time to eat the cooker rice at the door, and the casserole of the cooker is cracked.
In the past few years, I have not eaten a day, and the rise of various small shops of Cantonese cuisine has scattered the passenger flow.
It is rare to see the store has a seat, the quality of the dishes is not said, as always good.
Taste of good meat staples praise
Day Chang takeaway.
[Rice] Meal: This meal is a little disappointing.
Three cups of chicken: a little more with dishes, a little less chicken.
The main tone of this taste is a little biased, the bottom taste is not salty enough, it highlights the sweetness, we can make up the sweetness + various spices and dishes.
What is Red Whiskey?
Everyone's hobbies are different, some people like to collect, some people like food, of course, some people like to taste wine, red whiskey is one of the best-selling Scotch Whisky in various countries, and red whiskey has won the International Wine Competition Gold Award.
Every bottle of red whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it's not a waste of its aroma.
How to drink red whiskey?
A brief introduction to everyone.
Red Whiskey Drinks:
The red-branded whisky is made up of about 35 Scotch Whiskeys, with rich aromas and traditional Scotch whisky, with sweet and smoked aromas.
The entrance is fresh and fresh, with a slightly fragrant and strong smell of smoked malt.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice, or mixed with favorite drinks.
Red brand whiskey into the country, in order to adapt to the taste of the people, red brand whiskey + Coke or Sprite or novelty and other bubble drinks become a long-lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being neutralized and sour, can bring pleasure to people visually, add drinks, and play a role in rinsing the effect of wine to change the taste.
Red brand whiskey + sliced lemon + square sugar (sand sugar can also be), is the most authentic and traditional way of drinking.
The authentic red square wei tastes a bit sour, add sugar can neutralize the sour taste, lemon will bring a fresh aroma to the wine, of course, sweet acidity can be blended according to personal taste.
The above three are the best way to drink red whiskey, we can use as a reference to try, I hope that the introduction of Xiaobian can help everyone.
Educational thinking: how to make the university exam "student hegemony" and "slag" each get their own place
The three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leaders, reflecting the confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the exam, change the type of the exam, so that the exam can truly reflect the demand of the actual level of the students.
Indeed, for a long time, college exams have been a "hot topic".
On the university campus, students come from all over the world, the ability level is different, coupled with the degree of learning is different, the learning situation is very different.
For groups with such multiple characteristics to assess, there are different feelings, which is inevitable.
Of course, if the test questions are single and the repetition rate is high, the questions are too simple, which will inevitably lead to another very different feeling.
Students who do not do well may pass the test before the centralized assault, if they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve a multiplier effect.
In this way, there is "scum" usually do not invest can pass, or even get high scores; "student hegemony" usually never drop the class, homework, notes as good, the exam is not much higher than the "strange status quo".
In this way, Lanzhou Jiaotong University students reflect that the problems in the university exam are not without reason, and believe that this situation is not only the existence of Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we must praise the three students who wrote a letter.
In fact, people who have been to the university are clear that it is not uncommon for people who have been to go to college to prepare for the exam, to think of various ways to "set" the exam from the teacher, to strive for the scope of the exam, and to get the phenomenon of "key tutoring" before the exam, even in the exam with small copies, after the exam to ask the teacher to raise the noble hand is not a strange news.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment orientation, measuring the qualification of a university exam is more about the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate level of the university, the major began to be subdivided, and many professional courses were based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to fully grasp the basic knowledge of a discipline is the content of the university examination to be examined.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the discipline and basic common sense, from the point of knowledge, the space for change is not large, basically fixed.
As some teachers said, "20 years ago to study the basics of mathematics, still studying, or focus."
However, the knowledge point is basically unchanged, and does not represent a single test question type and repeated test questions.
In many universities, the exam will generally form a question group, and then the senior teachers of the discipline will form a comprehensive examination paper, and the examination reading will also be attended by all the teachers who bear the department, so that the duplication of test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw a set of test questions that meet the actual teaching and learning, according to the overall situation of students learning, it is difficult to display a normal distribution, and it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of student learning, so that the test proposition can be dynamically grasped by the difficulty and problem type, which can highlight the basic knowledge investigation, but also take into account the ability to investigate, and at the same time innovate the problem type.
The exam is the baton of university education, what kind of examination, students will have the corresponding preparation program, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's proposal letter, the Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed rectification programs throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and course completion examinations against self-examination, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and audit links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of single type of test questions, repeated questions and other issues are the topics that the university examination needs to face, of course, the need to introduce the corresponding system, but the kung fu is expensive in the daily, need teachers to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student's learning situation, two ends permeable, teaching and learning will be better docking, the formation of a benign interaction, the exam will also be more in line with the actual, so that "learning" and "scum" each.

(KOKNA) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that due to the use of special anti-counterfeiting paper inventory, it has not been possible to issue newspaper paper for newborn babies since the beginning of October, and 3,200 people have accumulated to date.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairou Aminus, assured that all babies who have applied for newspaper paper have been recorded in the system, and when the anti-counterfeiting paper is shipped next week, it will be repaid.
At the press conference, he explained the 10-month report that an online media reported the problem of newspaper printing in Sabah.
He said that the problem appeared two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the production of special anti-counterfeiting paper Chinese manufacturers affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed arrival in China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah newspaper paper was different from other regions, so it was not possible to borrow from the inventory of other states.
Kailu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for part of the printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, back to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing, it is estimated that more than 2 working days (December 20) can be handed over to the applicant."

48 hours of negative nucleic acid, set up a "buffer zone" State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document to strengthen the port city epidemic prevention and control
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporter Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The State Council joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice to strengthen the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring personnel who have recently left the land border port city (except those connected to ports in Hong Kong and Macao) need to hold a negative proof of nucleic acid detection within 48 hours, and go to the land border port city to carry out at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame of the above requirements is from the date on which the provinces, regions and cities determine the scope of the port city and announce it until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones in the jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health and Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the border people of the two sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of the differentiated management policy of subdivisions, from a prevention and control spillage defense line to two lines of defense, is expected to achieve the threshold forward, compress the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the greatest results of epidemic prevention and control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster epidemics in China, all of which are imported by overseas epidemics through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some local epidemic monitoring and early warning is not timely, the closed-loop management of high-risk positions is not implemented, regular nucleic acid detection flows in form, cold chain items are not in place in all aspects, centralized isolation place management is not standardized, and the emergency response to the epidemic is not scientific and accurate enough.
The notice requires that efforts be made to improve the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improve the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implement border control measures, accelerate the completion of the shortcomings of port city prevention and control, do not relax, scientifically and accurately do a good job in prevention and control, and weave a tight line of external defense input defense.
The notice stressed that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood protection work simultaneously, publish and unblock the hotline for people's livelihood protection, regularly investigate the hidden dangers of basic living supplies and prices, and solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to therein include open land, waterways, air ports located in the counties (cities, districts, flags), cities (land, states, alliances) and municipalities directly under the Central Government, the specific scope of which by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control to determine and timely announcement.

The bottom of the pipeline video at the bottom of the U.S. military's 20 years of bloodthirsty killing truth - Xinhua
(Source: The Oil Pipe)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the pipeline platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launched the war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism", forcibly exported American democracy through war, and committed various crimes against humanity for 20 years, such as poor military force, bloodthirsty, and indiscriminate killing of innocents.
The abuse of drones to air strikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorts human nature, and sets up killing teams.
In the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up a "black jail" to inflict all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on the "suspects".
One crime against humanity has aroused hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorism" war "the more anti-Vietnam terrorism."
The war has not brought hope for peace, democracy and prosperity for the Afghan people, but only devastated countries and countless killings and destruction.
Let's take a look at the truth of the bloodthirsty killing in the name of "counter-terrorism" and puncture the hypocritical fascination of American democracy!
Unintentionally see the following article, from the perspective of business and shelf life to talk about why the customer wants to bonded area inside the logistics company to do canned, although the canning belongs to the deep processing, does not belong to the scope of the business of bonded logistics company, here is the following text may explain why customers want to do this?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers, contact a lot of milk powder production line.
In fact, the raw materials of the bag and the sound of milk powder are the same, and there is no difference.
So you will certainly ask: why is the shelf life of the bag is one year, and the shelf life of listening to the packaging is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mother-level people think that because the raw materials are not the same, the quality will be much better.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who eat out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of listening is different!
Now let me tell you about the reason why it is expensive to listen to, where is the cost?
Why is the difference between their raw materials and the same price?
Because most manufacturers in the pricing are considered if the bagged pricing is too high, consumers are difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturers generate low profits, or no profits, then what do manufacturers rely on to survive?
So they have a big rise in the pricing of listening to the dress to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly push to listen to the packaging, rather than the bag.
And you think so many manufacturers every year advertising costs tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars, what is the cost?
Everyone can imagine.
So with the development of society, the market promotion costs, such as: shopping mall promotion personnel, shopping mall display costs, product gift costs, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and listening to clothing, its price is also constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their own products, do not hesitate to link with the doctors in the hospital, by their assistance in the promotion of products, from a listen to the inside of 30 yuan to 80 yuan of profits.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, in fact, this practice is to harm consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder in the can at home under the premise of filling the can, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, it does not have any impact on children.
And we do not think that the shelf life of listening to the bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of the bag is the same after the bag is opened, it is not easy to save after the bag is open, and it is easy to be spoiled by the tide.
The food delivery is late, the food is cold, and after the cold is dry and hard, there is no way to eat it.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua Net
When you visit the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Many of today's successful books preach the "best principle"—that is, to presuppose or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that it has suddenly passed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
That's why these books have one thing in common—either do the best thing at the same time, or simply do nothing; or 100, or 0; or you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay in place.
This "best principle", let anyone see will admit that "correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated in front of the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, to be a human being again, to make a great 180-degree transformation", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who abide by the rules, follow the old, and refuse to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano.
The vast majority of people will be tidy in front of the word "change", wrapped up, difficult to make a decision; or with the impulse to pain the determination of "change", and bravely took the first step, but often the good scene is not long, can not hold on for a little while to lose the battle, it is difficult to see the continuity.
The famous "starting from tomorrow" by Mr. Ma Sanli is the most eloquent expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's capabilities, so that the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps, the "second good principle" is a way to make more ordinary people on the road to relative success.
The core of the "good secondary principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a "small victory for big" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, only do 1 can do it: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Taishan, you can only climb the small sand dunes on your doorstep, because it is always stronger than the place.
In short, as long as you do something, it is always better than not doing it.
Because the threshold is greatly lower, it is more likely to make ordinary people insist on it, and as long as everything is adhered to, the probability of success will increase.
Only to follow the "sub-good principle" of the road of success, its road is slightly longer.
In short, the "best principle", although on the surface, under the banner of making everyone successful, is actually a minority, which can ultimately be stimulated; and the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as much as possible.

Qinghai Lake bare carp resources this year increased by 0.71 million tons - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the storage of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp common name "tround", is a unique precious species of fish in Qinghai Lake, to maintain the Qinghai Lake watershed "water-fish-bird" ecological chain security and biodiversity plays a pivotal role.
In the 1960s and 1970s, affected by factors such as the increasing degradation of the environment of man-made hunting and naked carp breeding waters, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake fell sharply, and the amount of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake in 2002 was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, in the Red List of Chinese Species, Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lake fish, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual fishing of naked carp to the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release and the clean-up of Qinghai Lake's main river channels into the lake, the design of a scientific and reasonable "fish channel" and other measures continue to increase protection, Qinghai Lake bare carp resources increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that as of now, Qinghai Lake bare carp has implemented a total of nearly 180 million tails of artificial proliferation and release, and the contribution rate to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 23%.
The Sanjiangyuan area of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has issued the notice of prohibition of fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and built a comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

The restaurant only gave me a bag, to be packed into the bag, the weather was cold.
Ask yourself, is the sale in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if it's missing, or if we've got someone to take it, thank you.
It’s been an hour and I haven’t arrived yet.
I just saw a fake article, too long.
Give it to men you don’t know.
Most girls experience their first holiday on a day between the ages of 13 and 15, and absence around the age of 50.
After that, the health will come more regularly once a month.
But it is not regular enough to accurately predict, about a week or so tolerance, need to prepare in advance, sometimes bad luck will roll over (suddenly a few days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people for three days, some people for a week; some people flow less, some people have a big bloodfall; some people have no reaction, some people are painful to the ambulance to get away, the pain will change with time, and the pain does not mean that there is no pain for a lifetime.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a few days from the beginning to the end, and all you can do is use a sanitary pad or tampon to prevent the flow to the chair.
The pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandin, the physiological period has not yet had time to eat ibuprofen before the pain can effectively relieve the pain of the month, and it is useless to eat after the beginning of dysmenorrhea.
Before the physiological period, due to the uterine congestion and prostaglandine release too much, it is easy to pull the stomach.
If it is about to reach the cycle, inexplicably, it will basically come to menstruation within two days.
Sanitary napkins are best replaced once in two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst case is to replace it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is, 42 pieces, if you add the part prepared in advance may have 50 pieces, not a piece every month.
(Modified here, tampons do not need to be changed frequently, about five or six hours to change once, the longest eight hours)
Menstrual hormones may be more irritable, ovulation period will also be because of the body hormone changes mood instability, is very unlucky, the body to make their own tripping.
But official crime rate data can show that women's ability to control their emotions is still high, and they do not use emotional problems to make excuses.
The flow is not just blood, it contains the lining of the uterus that falls off.
The endometrium after menstruation is the thinnest, and then slowly thicken, can be understood as the utese is the house, every month to build a house (the lining thickened) ready to welcome guests, guests did not come, all removed (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, re-starting.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, 24 hours a day every month bleeding, but also abdominal pain, who would like to?
But people can be born because his mother came to menstruate, menstruation is to prepare you to come to this world for the first time to live in a house for 10 months, everyone thanks their mother regularly and healthy to come to the menstrual period.
In the past, many things for women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that it was dirty and shameful, and everyone thought it was like that, but the times changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, feel that the female body for the birth of life to make the preparation behavior disgusting, should not be said in public, girls stand up, do not think so, never experienced, never experienced in this life, do not know how to understand the men, do not be so ungrateful and do not know how to be mercituous, how good attitude is to face their mothers, how to want their children?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons, which is really good.
Today is the winter solstice festival, and it is disappointing to send wrong.
I want to order another meal for the kids.
I hope that the store is busy to check the product.
Is the foot-bubble feet leaking electricity?
Choosing the right foot tub can play a good role in foot therapy and health care, and today's U.S. editor will answer this question and hope to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, the foot tub is more and more loved by consumers, and a large number of different products have emerged in the market, from more than one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of room for choice.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional home appliances, health appliances such as foot tubs are hot, but there is no special industry standard for foot tubs, so there are certain safety hazards.
“It’s too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!”
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father to make a birthday gift, but his father felt the bottom of his feet when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li at first thought that it was caused by the vibration function of the foot tub, and he did not expect to shut down the vibration function, and his father still felt the foot hemp.
Mr. Li tried with an electric pen, the pen actually lit up, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot tub was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, the business attitude is not bad, although the withdrawal of the bathtub, Mr. Li still feel unhappy.
Because he found that this long-popular foot tub now has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the setting of the highest temperature, what kind of population is suitable for, and what kind of material is guaranteed to be harmless.
However, in general, the foot tub will not have a charged problem, but it does not rule out that a few products do not have strict control when leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a split foot tub at the time of purchase.
Hydropower is separated without any safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take any brush test.

That little given the same, you a melchee chicken sauce want money
You called the restaurant.
I just don't want to go downstairs to buy things, I will spend so much money to call takeout.
Ding Zilin: To my friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my friends for the humanitarian assistance that has not been interrupted since more than 30 years of the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally issued an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Today, the parents of the vast majority of the victims have already thanked the world, and the orphans have grown up to work.
It is your righteousness that has helped these troubled families through the most difficult times.
At present, the new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most donors have also retired every year.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend your humanitarian contributions to our family, the Tiananmen Mothers, which should have ended with the perfect end of this humanitarian relief campaign.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteousness will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Let me take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by the American Federation of Students (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian assistance, the All-American Self-Distance is a parallel between the Minnesota Foundation for Democracy and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation, and the project's implementers often cross.

The rescue money often does not reach the hands of the June 4th difficulty.
In 1994, Mr. Ding suggested that a special group be set up by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and distribute the receiving and distribution of the road relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the June 4 Orphans Education Fund, which was implemented 11 years later, and in 2009, after all the orphans graduated from college, MCDF set up the June Fourth Orden Special hardship fund, and has been implementing it to this day.
The funds for these projects, mainly from the campus and social donations of June Fourth, came from generous donations from individuals and were supported by the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the June Fourth family finally received a donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Human Rights in China is also independently implementing their humanitarian assistance programs.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped the donation of June Fourth, for the consideration of donors, we are indeed some retired elderly people, income is not as abundant as before retirement, I would like to thank Teacher Ding's "to friends" letter.
We will respect the decision of the difficult individuals to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
Thank you and respect for those who have been generous for many years and risked the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Thank you rabbit review originally said that the rejection of the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient wind, did not expect the finished product to come out is simply too beautiful
Thanks to Dandan's recognition, your satisfaction can make us full of electricity continue to move forward, we will continue to fuel!
This photography studio is really great, and I highly recommend it to all my friends!
Whether it is from reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography to the later period are impeccable.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate, will match the right makeup according to your style, cosmetics are also a line of big brands.
Teacher Tian Liang, not to mention, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio is very artistic, and there are two kittens to play with.
We are working in Beijing, Beijing better studios need to queue up half a year in advance, colleagues have been filmed in Beijing, watched the film feel just so.
I searched for this studio, a place where there is an attitude of the soul.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, I think this is also a short version of most people, the photographer Liang Ge will capture, record the natural wonderful moment.
Makeup artist, photographer, late design, a well-equipped team.
We and the people around us are full of praise.
I have recommended my girlfriend in the past, and my girlfriend has just seen the negatives and is equally happy.
I hope that such a studio should not be buried, and more people will find it and shoot out their own style, rather than being the same.
Thank you very much for the five-star comments of Cham Eagle and Jingling, two of whom are very thoughtful and creative newcomers, we are creative studios, as long as customers like us to do our best to complete, grateful to meet each other.
Sweet and intimate assistant, as well as lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice a wonderful shot, a very memorable experience, and the effect of shooting is much better than I thought everyone worked hard, thank you 😘😘 very much.

If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you do not have the idea of this, it is best to teach yourself, after all, the training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if it is intended to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have self-control and their weakness, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to teach yourself, but you will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, we must look at the teaching strength of this institution, if the teaching staff is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong teachers.
Secondly, before choosing to explore this training institution, it is best to explore the students who come out of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is, and the course is good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer this question, because I don't have a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, professional, age, the language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you study or want to do.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or the computer major has graduated, then if the time is sufficient I personally recommend self-study, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, now many offline online training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, two investment time is more, the basic need to focus on training 3-6 months.
But if it is what I said these situations, self-study is very convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the network are free, or go to the B station also have a lot of training resources, if you do not look for resources, you can also contact me through the profile, access to free resources, or detailed consultation can also be.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but you can also pay for a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to go to the training institution to learn, so the learning is not very laborious, the teacher explains is also very detailed, there are also special answers to the problem, in addition to learning planning or supervision is also helpful.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal push places, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the interview process of looking for a job can also save a lot of things.
The above is some of my views, the above said because I do not know your situation, so only probably the introduction is not detailed, if you have others want to consult, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
I said before 1 o'clock, I saw it in the app.
What to call
I haven’t finished yet, what are you doing?
I, undertake all kinds (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted stove water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, hood, luminaire, polishing glass, professional seam, housekeeping service

Life will not live up to everyone who strives, like to pay attention to me, thank you to those who silently praise me
Life is like this, others only look at the results, their own independent process, in the face of life, we in addition to being strong, is to continue, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back...

The more you are afraid, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you meet the difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
China-Saudi curators join hands to hold Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale - Xinhua
RIYADH, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriye JAX Art Zone, northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
The Biennale was co-curated by the Saudi Diriye Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Weiyu, Director of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, China, as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennale is "crossing the river with stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
The Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presenting them in six units: "Touching Stones Crossing the River", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Brave New World" and "The Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performing arts and other forms; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly concerned, and some artists use recycled materials to create in novel ways, such as Xu Bing in the "The story series behind the stream" (2014), with the waste reconstruction of a classic landscape painting.
Barkley, CEO of the Dirier Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that the Biennale will establish an international dialogue, so that global audiences will have the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industries and creative communities and strengthen interaction.
“The goal of the Biennale is twofold, both to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art,” Tian said.
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the Biennale, and artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize rural public welfare job management - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in the employment of people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies to promote rural revitalization of rural public welfare job management, helping to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Affairs Department, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare positions for the resettlement of employment of rural difficult groups such as the labor force out of poverty, which plays an important role in helping the people out of poverty to achieve employment and income, consolidate the achievements in poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in rural areas.
The new regulations are jointly issued by seven departments such as Yunnan Human Resources, Rural Revitalization and Finance, and mainly standardize the scope of the target, fund management, job development, and post management for the recruitment of rural public welfare positions at the grass-roots level.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations are clear, and are set in accordance with the principles of "on-demand, on-demand, on-demand, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible", and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, audit, publicity, recruitment, pre-job training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, subsidy standards and subsidies for rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that the development departments of rural public welfare posts should purchase commercial insurance for rural public welfare post placements; relevant departments are required to supervise the issuance of subsidies for rural public welfare posts on a regular basis.
The address is wrong.
Hello
Can you cancel the order?
I re-ordered.
Has it been cancelled?
Second, although the right has a promising era in history, it is not long, so the short is because it is brilliant to give a little sunshine, drink a little boiling water and sweat; a little ambition will look at Shu, and the hair will be attached to the blow.
But in terms of facts, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
From the aspects of ending the definition of truth standards of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy to improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right should not be denied.
As far as I am concerned, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statement and respect Li Weidong; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about China's social problems.
But I am opposed to his anti-communist theory, and I think that the counter-essential revolution, the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, people's livelihood is damaged, and political groups are mixed with silt, and then foreign countries are entering by chance.
Fourth, change or improve China's attitude of patience and responsibility for the country for the people, political speculation is trying to take the chestnut, it is not the right, is the bastard.
Talk to the left.
The left is actually a group of age and political outcasts.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right speech and analyze their thoughts when it needs it, then the left will not create it, because what the left wants is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
V. Recently, I have seen some friends fighting the thief's side, and I am still very excited, I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitor and the left, it's all a piece of brist, it's unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think about letting the anti-thief and the left admit it, why?
I tell my friends this way: when the thief scolds you for five cents, when the left curses your right dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, and when they are old, they forget the ideal, or pursue the ideal, but become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually drifted away, and even the dragon-slaughtering boy eventually became a dragon.
On the left and right, I think generally refers to constraints and freedom, and the innate gene of China from history and culture leads to China as a whole should be left-wing.
While the domestic right is free, focusing on efficiency and development, the left has strengthened supervision and paid more attention to fairness and security.
At present, society in general hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the United States are competing, the left is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Even if you don’t understand it, praise is over.
I don't know, the flowers are so righteous.
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the United States have not only plunged Huawei into unprecedented difficulties, but also caused huge losses to "American" enterprises.
The United States and the United States suppress the Chinese chip industry, requiring companies from enterprises and allies to block China's chip industry at the same time, the direct result is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, resulting in a global chip supply chain shortage of chaos.
Now the "lack of core" has affected the world's major industries, such as car companies to stop production, mobile phone prices, almost all the use of chips in the industry are deeply affected.
In order to master the "chip" autonomy, more and more national technology giants began to "de-beautify" the road.
In order to firmly control the control of global semiconductors and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the recent old and American actions are frequent, and the "chip summit" is presided over; it is also an invitation to 64 Chinese giants to set up a semiconductor alliance and pull out the funds to support the US domestic technology giants, for example, the old technology giant Intel in order to regain the dominant position in the chip field, spent 20 billion U.S. dollars to build 2 wafer processing plants in Arizona, and open up chip foundry business.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to steal TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason for this affirmation is that Intel, as an old-fashioned technology giant in the United States, has been deeply cultivated in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, which will surely be able to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou is dismissive.
At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou said amazingly, for Intel's investment in building a fab, Zhang Zhongmou has no scruples: Intel built a chip foundry, quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's inroads into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou is still worried about a period of resentment between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the US-Dimei manufacturing industry, ranking at the top of the world, and the hegemon in the world semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip from design, manufacturing to sealing was done by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Under the inspiration of market demand, after entering the 80s, the chip industry began to appear division of labor and cooperation phenomenon, in 1984 Zhang Zhongmou heard that there is a special chip design company, it is believed that since there is a special design, then you can set up a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aimed the main business at the single link of "wab processing", not designed, and only provided foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC, which had just been founded, was Xiao Yi in the face of Intel's Big Mac.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had sought Intel investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it was obvious that some people saw themselves as very high, looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer process services at that time.
I did not expect to look down on the giants of wafer manufacturing services, but now I also have to start to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that Intel's entry into the wafer foundry is ironic.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards a 3nm chip, and Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
Getting ahead is not easy.
Not waiting.
Ordered at 19:06 for 2 hours 😅
I’m going to see some weird stuff today.
What is normal opinion?
Random selection of three hot searches: February two dragons head up, good friends price increase, cargo pull event, public opinion diffusion to form a peak, and then [exponential decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipated, if secondary public opinion will be a small hump reappears.
They seem to be no different from the "network public opinion evolution model" that the Internet Information Office has shown on its official website.
What is unusual opinion?
Random selection of six hot searches in the same event, showing [orphan peaks], [jagged], [cliff-like].
[Lone peak shape] that is, artificial heating, quickly rushed to the hot search, causing public concern; [jagged] is cyclical heating, to ensure that the topic is tucked into the hot search list; [cliff shape] is the collective evacuation, the hot search to play the "function", receive new tasks, rushed to the new battlefield.
Figure 9, the heat of an event peak happens to be another event of the valley, the time is not bad, must be unified batch of water forces received the task, open a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which are responsible for popular science, which diverts attention, which influences on cognition, which misleading judgments, which incites emotions, and which hostage decisions, black production accounts are finely combated in batches and points, almost taking into account all the elements of public opinion dissemination and diffusion.
Communication is a science, put aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Whoever walks by will leave traces, such traces, we dug out together.

Mauritius and other countries for the first time found cases of Omikjon strain infection - Xinhua
BEIJING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported for the first time the discovery of the new coronavirus Omikjon strain.
Mauritius reported two cases of the Omikron strain for the first time on the 10th.
According to the Minister of Health of Mao, Kéleish Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on 27 November; the other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius, who tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after contact with a person who had recently returned from his trip to South Africa.
After isolation treatment by the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people have turned negative, and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed three cases of Omikjon strain for the first time.
All three were students who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not admitted to the hospital for treatment because of all minor illness.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omikron strain, the Cypriot government has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter by plane will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin to vaccinate children from 5 to 11 years old in the country with the new Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawi's health minister, Kunbize Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country has found three cases of the Omikjung strain for the first time.
The country’s health department sequenced genomes of 12 new coronavirus-positive samples collected from Nov. 9 to Dec. 2, and found three cases of infection.

Damei 360 integrated home improvement
Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No. 156, South Huancheng Road
At first, my friend introduced it because of trust, so I chose to look at the initial budget of 70,000 to do a basic renovation.
Come to the store and start a series of scams.
I was the first time I just showed them my apartment map, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they actually can give me a quote that my 135 house 70,000 can be done, probably gave me a look at their materials and do not know what brand of material they are.
Their second trick is that as long as you get to the store, you will drag you to pay the deposit (and once you pay it, you will never be able to withdraw it, unless you have enough experience to fight theory with them).
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you how much you can give you today if you pay the deposit.
This is a big pit, I am an example of life being cheated, in the mind impulse, pay more than ten thousand deposits.
He gave me an offer of a lot of problems with 70,000 not including the utility, not including any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and the three are the cost of the base.
Excluding these service points, they also charge higher fees than other companies.
I lost trust in the company and let me sign the contract without saying anything clearly at the beginning.
When I went to them to refund the money they showed a very experienced look, with a small team to deal with you.
In any case, it is a matter of customers who will bite to death, and they are completely blameless.
All kinds of shirking responsibilities, there are still many details, do not want to say one by one are tears, in short, do not choose them, because my friends look for their renovated house is also not good quality, the later calculation of all kinds of expenses.
Daddy, they are the original deceptive faucet decoration, now changed to great beauty, as if it closed down and changed to other.
So don't choose such a daddy decoration company.
In the future, when you choose, you will take a look at these inquiries because decoration is not a small amount of money.

Starry sky has about the Geminids meteor shower 14 ushered in a great - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) astronomical science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great one on December 14, and friends who like the meteor shower can observe in the middle of the night.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anju Geminid meteor shower photographed in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the parent objects of the meteor shower are periodic comets, but the parent object of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science, said that like the New Year's blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability, and together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Geminids meteor shower is that the meteoroid is slower, the color is rich, and there are many fire meteors, which are suitable for visual purposes and for beginners of astrophotography.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast in Tianjin, photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin, on December 13, 2020.
Astrological forecasts show that this year's Geminids meteor shower will reach a great deal around 15:00 on December 14, when ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the radiation point is directly above the top of the head, the number of meteors can be seen every hour) is 150.
The Geminids Meteor Shower Recommended Index.
"Last year, the 'falling and colorful' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminids meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the degree of wonderfulness will be reduced a little.
14th for the lunar November 11th, the moon phase is the convex moon, bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, but in the middle of the night the moon will fall, at this time the Geminid meteor shower radiation point will rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe these hours behind the moon in the middle of the night, but pay attention to cold and keep warm.
How can we see as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to make observations in the city, you can choose a high altitude, small light, facing the northeast of the field of view in the suburbs or villages, and then patiently wait until the moon falls, visual observation can be."
It should be noted that the flow of the Geminid meteor shower in all directions is very large, and there is no need to keep staring at the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
If you like photography, if you want to shoot a gorgeous "meter shower blockbuster", it is best to choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, using high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, spare batteries and shutter lines are also essential.
Pingback reminded me.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the subject of the traditional TV should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference between the laser TV and the LCD TV in the market positioning, there are mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the full spread of LCD TV market positioning, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of large screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is more than 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyi Kang, in 2020, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140%, and continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such a good result in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source is not directly transmitted into the eyeball, compared to the dorbolight light of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute's Saisi Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital ophthalmologists passed a rigorous comparison test of watching laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the crowd, and came up with 144 sets of test data.
The data confirm that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics and even has a certain improvement in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more valued, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the current market laser TV prices are mostly more than 10,000 yuan, with the upgrading of size and light source, the price has gradually increased.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
Surely it makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technical level, laser TVs have many advantages that can not be achieved with LCD TVs and projection.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and the large screen experience can be achieved in a short distance, the required space is not large, and the host is small and occupies a small place.
In terms of brightness, the large brand laser TV can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition to the lower heat, the equipment loss is small, the service life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and bionic screen, which can bring more shocking audio-visual experience to users.
Not to talk about the pseudo demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on the quality of the picture and input ratio, laser TV is not the video player's dish, want to take into account the large screen and the viewing environment is insufficient, you can try, everything is pros and cons, weigh their own judgment after, afraid to listen to the words.
Simply put, ultra-wide-angle near-focus projectors - laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, had to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which did not conform to the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of microstructure of the Finel screen, the cost is high, the price of 80 inches can basically change a 65-inch liquid crystal.
Another point, I especially hate projection manufacturers take diffuse reflection to the eyes this kind of selling point, please, the eyes can see the light on the screen for the eyes is direct light, you diffuse to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, the real LCD TV is also diffuse "straight", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffused, it will not be like it at all.
It is precisely the thermal spot (light spot) effect of the high gain curtain that is ignored, and a large amount of light at a certain angle is reflected to the eyes, which is really uncomfortable.
The visual aesthetic photography museum has no preferred quality shop for the time being.
Add the WeChat appointment date, the little sister will choose the schedule sent to me, reply to the message is more timely ~
Before going to see the shooting works in the store, more is the outdoor wedding dress, the shooting is very beautiful, and there are many shooting styles involved.
After the day arrived and the little sister simply communicated their own ideas, very patiently helped me try two sets of my tangled style clothes, and finally finalized the beginning of the makeup shape ~ Photographer will put some props before shooting, will guide the action, the details are also more refined.
But maybe because I didn't communicate with me the specific shooting idea, it's not the style I want, but it should be good looking 🙊🙊
After taking it, the photographer will help to select photos, communicate the later style, and feel very careful.
It takes about half a month to repair the film, and the effect is waiting for it.
The second time in the photo class of the overlord meal activities ~ most of the clothes in the whole scene can choose one shot.
In the end, choose a black dress and experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, responsible for the shooting of the photographer is the 95-year-old brother, feel a little or a little astringent, hoping to give more advice in the customer shooting action guidance later ah ~ very chatty, the shooting process is more pleasant.
Visual Aesthetic Photography Museum Preferred Quality Store Reply
Take a look at Queenie.
Go to the store first fill in the name of the phone and then choose the clothing, wedding dress can be selected, change three or four sets of clothing is quite patient, after the selection of makeup for a long time, the service attitude is good, behind the shooting will teach you how to put the shape, that is, the feeling of shooting is very large, refinement said to be half a month, three or four days sent, feel as if there is no difference with the original film
The whole environment is fine.
There are a lot of clothes to choose from.
There are almost three make-up positions, and there are studios inside.
Very warm and very attentive.
The stylist was patient.
Photographers will also be very serious about how to move.
Unsatisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to make up the film.
[Experience] It may be a little over the shape, the original double eyelids were posted three eyelids.
The eyebrows were also shaved, a little embarrassed for the daily do not draw eyebrows.
The photo was given in about ten days, but the P-map effect was not very satisfactory, and it felt that the double eyelids were still obvious.
Because I don't know what style I want, try two sets of results to pick and choose or choose a black dress Little sister said that this set is more Hepburn retro style
After choosing a good dress, I started to make up my hair, the hairdresser and the makeup artist's little sister were super patient in helping me get out of the effect very satisfied.
After getting a good make-up hair, I began to take pictures, the photographer had to direct me to pose, and the process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After shooting carefully selected four favorite when the fine brother said 15 into a film, the end is very satisfied.
I haven’t responded for 3 days... Since your system can’t recognize my credit card, I can’t join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I have to pay for shipping every time.
Can you be exempted first, and then you will collect my monthly fee after you investigate, okay?
Small umbrellas for insurance, right?
The Little Umbrella is an internet insurance broker.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the last three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan to be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very harsh, summed up is to have the strength, through the CBRC (regulation of the national insurance companies, banks) the national authority approval, shareholders have a good style, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, the policyholder is not too much to question the small umbrella insurance is no regular or not, after all, there are these three thresholds, not any insurance company can reach.
At this point, it’s good and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star serious illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest list and Thai super Mary No. 5 serious illness insurance, the claim and the insurer are and Thai life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not question its reliableness.
From the payment mode: the product of the Internet platform, because of the lack of business expenses of business outlets, and the cost of the wages of business staff, so the Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, support monthly payment, reduce the pressure on the payment of policyholders, and can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's still very good.
can be considered.
From the perspective of the professional degree of salesman: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very strong professional industry, many Internet product customers can insure themselves, this will have a lot of misunderstandings, in the health notification and occupation of this, non-insurance practitioners often in the insurance will add their own subjective consciousness, feel healthy or in line, so it is easy to have a lot of claims hidden dangers, there may be the risk of rejection.
I have done insurance phone sales in "Tencent microinsurance" (like a small umbrella, but also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and told everyone very responsibly.
Internet insurance is real, but also reliable, not reliable is people, Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, there are many sales misleading.
For example: 1 yuan insurance insurance 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 serious insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but the weight is light, will not tell the policyholder, the first month 1 yuan, the following month is the need to charge according to the normal charge, dozens to 200, many customers charge a year or two of their own to buy what is not clear.
I thought I could spend 1 dollar, and the insurance company paid 6 million (the world fell pie).
Free mobile phone, is the policy tail number such as 6666,888 this special policy section to send, and if the winning text message is sent, they do not exchange, and no one is reminded.
(This is a pit for policyholders, it is a pit) free to receive 60,000 serious insurance, is short-term, if only rely on this, there is no other business insurance, in case of serious illness, 60,000 can do, can not solve the problem, the future life began to run naked.
At present, the country is also cracking down on the misalignment of Internet insurance sales.
So on the whole, the platform is no problem, there is no problem with the product, the problem is the professionalism and professional conduct of the salesman.
In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have wider products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and the cost performance of some products is also better than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, underwrite offline products, and saved 2,000-3000 yuan / year for each person.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
I: Mingya insurance broker, has 3 years of enterprise management training experience, service more than a thousand enterprise users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before insurance, I will start from customer needs, tailor-made insurance products for customers, insurance, for customers around, try to strive for the best insurance results for customers, after insurance, for customers to do insurance policy finishing, insurance custody, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with each client for life.
I hope my answer will be helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance business that can independently complete all the insurance processes after the policyholder clicks on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance is not too "ceremonial", and even the printed version of the paper contract is not, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" general assembly line operation, but so the purchase of insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a decades-long contract, when we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediation" we choose is not an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?

No problem, remember no need to arrange a re-send, I have bought another, do not want to waste
Thank you for your help.
From before and now, I have opposed any form of slander and invective, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this villain.
If you do not look at political parties and factions, you must resist first, it is this uncivilized style.
From the time you start posting Facebook and friend requests, and then post a fun post, to your attempt to post the so-called location of my home and my father’s name on social media, I’ve taken a non-responsive attitude.
After you become more and more, not only continue to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continue to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook and my so-called friends unscrupulously about some of my obscure and humiliating remarks, appearance, body, good health, what kind of bed strawberries, do you want to insert and so on, I also count.
How do I know that I later received a number of friends sent about your Facebook friend's account to upload a picture of you and a sexual harassment component of the speech.
As a girl, I can’t stop being silent.
After I reported the news to the police, you did not converge at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I ignore what political background you are, and no matter what status you are, in our society, we need respect from both sexes.
Yes, you can continue to make such funny, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks, you can also continue to talk about you just loving and paying attention to me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not a picture you make or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can’t and I don’t have the power to stop you.
I neither know you nor you, and my looks and figure do not need your evaluation.
I don’t even think there’s going to be a girl who’s willing to let someone humiliate themselves so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, is it okay?
I said yes, you won’t believe it either.
I don’t think any girl can say that she’s okay after being so bullied.
Whether at work, in society, in politics, or in business, only those who do not even have basic moral character will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I deleted some of the messages for everyone to comment.
Your own post should no one be able to impersonate you.
All I can say is that you are the enemy of civilization.
Heart to laugh.

According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" news, on January 9, the satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to be deployed by the Carl Vinson in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
The U.S. aircraft carrier, which is now snoring upstream of the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, has the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier departing from the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based squadron for the first time, which was part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Lake Champlain" missile cruiser, "Stokdar" missile destroyer and so on.

(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) The three US aircraft carriers gathered around China for the most powerful weapons rare visit to Guam on January 17, 2022, the U.S. warship carrier CMV-22B flight route.
According to a CNN report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam over the weekend.

The U.S.-three aircraft carrier builds up a rare visit to Guam, the most powerful weapon around China, and it is a signal to allies and enemies in the growing tension in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China for the most powerful weapons to visit Guam in rare times, China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as “Boomer submarines.”
The whereabouts of 14 Thunder submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.

Talking to friends about Meta's recent decline of 26% and the market value of $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded "in the face of unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, revenue mainly from advertising, today's money-making advertising companies, they have a channel of traffic.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, no matter what kind of feature location, are Meta’s traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "ad alliance", many apps external Meta advertising, through Meta's advertising platform is to realize the realization.
But the times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get the user's data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, will obviously prompt users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information, most people's normal response is certainly not allowed.
If Google stabs another stab, the impact on Meta’s revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta’s previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10 percent of Meta’s revenue each year comes from China, mainly from companies that make its sea business.
Meta has about a few hundred people in its offices in Hong Kong and several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is a bypass of advertising channels, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the TT is now one of Meta’s main competitors, but the first two years Meta made a lot of money from the byte.
All domestic agents are helping to go to Meta to advertise, and Meta Greater China's performance is also very good.
I haven’t been able to understand it lately, but it’s certainly not better than it was before.
The stage for Chinese companies to burn money overseas is over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only depends on income, but more importantly, what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta’s expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a more difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current scenery, also has a annual income of 100 billion to 200 billion U.S. dollars, in fact, Facebook is now very crisis-sensitive, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good safe moat.
Although several of his social software is now relatively high-lived, but also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also has no confidence, subversion between the blink of an eye.
And to engage in the metaverse of this unattainable concept, in a short period of time there is no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the company's name, but constantly looking for the root cause of the track, but I think his track choice is wrong, is not a way of return, some of my thoughts, for reference.
