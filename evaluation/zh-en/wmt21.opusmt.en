This year, the 34-year-old family, Zhang Yue, is in the village of Orchards in Sichuan Yingshan City, and in 2010 he resigned from his Beijing monthly job and returned home to start his business.
After several years of struggle, he now operates a vine-growing family farm that earns more than a million yuan a year, becomes a small and well-known leader in wealth creation and is selected to join the village's “councils” team.
In recent years, inspired by a range of pro-poor agricultural policies, such as the country's fight against poverty and rural revitalization, a growing number of excellent farmers like Zhang Yu have chosen to return home to start their own business, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
In the western part of the country, the labour-exporting province, Sichuan, led by the “Back-up Project for Good Farmer Workers”, in 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village branch secretaries were drawn from among the highly qualified rural workers, and 61,000 village reserve forces were nurtured, while more than 20,000 development party members provided strong guarantees for winning the fight against poverty and for the implementation of a strategy for rural renewal.
Xiao Xiang is not Xiao Xiao Xiao Xiang, it's Xiao Xiao Xiao Xiao Xiang.
Since the reform and opening of the country's economy, we have seen an increase in the number of young and young workers out of the country, some of whom have set up their own businesses by means of spelling.
However, the objective has also led to various degrees of “emptyness” in rural areas, particularly the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, the “old age” characteristic of village branch secretaries and party membership, i.e. old age, low academic qualifications, weak leadership of village organizations, and acute problems of non-matching.
Revitalization is an empty word if elements such as rural talent continue to flow in one direction to the cities and the village is in a state of “blood loss” and “anemia” for a long period of time.
Bringing back rural workers who are capable, conscious and willing to serve their homelands, leading them back to their home countries to become leaders in wealth generation, training from the middle to the top as party members and village cadres, and enriching the cadres at the grass-roots level, is a solution to the problems of rural party members and grass-roots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers are drawn back, and they need to be able to stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has taken the lead in arresting the Peasant Labour Party and, on the basis of strict selection criteria, has set up institutional mechanisms such as orientation, security of services, training and capacity-building, selection and use for good rural workers, enabling them to improve their abilities, job security and life prospects, genuinely to take root in rural areas, with a sense of achievement on the part of their officers.
This year has been the year when the fight against poverty has come to an end, and human resources are a key factor in linking the fight against poverty with rural revitalization.
The Government of the Party at all levels attaches great importance to the group of highly qualified returning peasant workers, who, through a combination of measures, will be left with a viable, combatable, non-detachable task force, a robust army that will provide strong organizational security and human support for rural poverty alleviation and the revitalization of development.
As a result of the epidemic, this year's university graduates were special. On the night of July 11, Bilibili's summer graduation song produced a special live live live performance for the graduates. The musicians of the old wolf, Parkki, Lee Woo-chun, Mao and others gave songs and blessing to their fellow graduates.
The well-known leader, SealWu Yifan, also brought a " Weeds ", a rapping song that he had adapted from Rusin's collection of poems of the same name, and was very popular among young people.
As a result of the epidemic, a number of graduates were unable to learn the sense of rituals that they were doing on the ground and giving their diplomas, and they shifted the sense of rituals online.
According to the data, this 2.5-hour song was broadcast live at a peak of over 35 million people.
“Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, take no account of the consequences, and sometimes the gains are unexpected.”
Although it is a graduation song, a number of songs also move non-responsible graduates.
“The whole scene really wants to cry. Everyone's youth is filled with beauty and regret, but it's all worth remembering.
Beijing’s natural ecology continues to be good, attracting more than 500 wildlife cities to “settling” - the Middle New Network.
2020-07-26 05:03:17 Source: Beijing Youth News. Author: Wang Si-seok.
The natural ecology of the capital continues to be good, attracting wildlife cities to "settling."
Beijing has more than 500 species of wildlife.
Reporters of the Beijing Youth News (Reporter Wang Bin) have learned from the Urban Forest Greening Bureau that the species and quantities of wildlife have continued to grow in recent years as the natural ecological environment of the capital continues to improve.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrates living in Beijing has increased to over 500 species, including protected animals at the national level, such as maroons, black storks, and second-level protected animals at the national level, such as falcons, swans, cranes and thugs.
Whether planted in a single urban forest in two rings or embedded in a small wetland between buildings, it not only brings the citizens of the capital the joy of nature, but also attracts wildlife to “settling” in the city.
During the summer season, the Pine Hill National Nature Conservancy, located in the mountains of Yinshan in the north-west of Yingqing District, was vibrant.
One of them was hanging around the mountain and playing, and two of them were fighting each other.
In retrospect, a wild boar can't stop scratching its skin. The director of the National Directorate of Nature Reserves at Matsuyama introduced the fact that, by the end of 2019, 178 species of wildlife, including the State-level conservation of animal gold sculptures and the State-level protection of animal spoon chickens, falcons, and nearly a third of the city's wildlife species, were visible in the green sea, covering a total area of more than 6,200 hectares.
“In Matsuyama, wild animals are the true `masters' and our staff are, at best, other people's `guards'.”
In order to gain an understanding of wildlife in protected areas on the ground, there are more than 30 professional escorts on a daily basis, travelling along 16 well-defined protection routes, and a monthly roundabout, which takes almost a full day to reach the entire protected area.
“In the course of the inspection, not only are biological diversity records checked, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, the rescue of injured wildlife, the installation of wild infrared cameras, etc.”.
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in the Matsuyama National Nature Reserve to document the state of life of wildlife in the forest.
Illustratively, as the biodiversity of protected areas has increased over the years and wildlife has become more visible in the lens, leopard cats, thugs and thugs have become “resident guests” and the “opportunity” for the protection of animal falcons at the national level has increased.
Zhang Zhi Minh, Head of the Wildlife and Wetlands Conservation Division of the Beijing Gardens Greening Authority, reported that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing had increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 today, and that the range and number of wildlife in Beijing had continued to increase in recent years.
The increasing visibility of wildlife in cities is closely linked to the increasing greening of the capital city in recent years.
In particular, a new wave of million acres of afforestation was launched in 2018, proposing the restoration of urban ecosystems, the enhancement of the ecological function of green lands on forested lands and the promotion of the concept of “near nature”.
The plan seeks to interact with the surrounding greenfields and to make it easier for wildlife to “visit and visit” and to plant trees that animals love as honey and feeding plants.
Black land “plants” out of agricultural modernization - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Society, Harbin, July 26th.
During the summer, two spray planes ran over the 10,000 acres of high-yielding demonstration fields at the second operating station in the fifth management area of the Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the “first round of the world” in the green fields, developed with black rice seedlings, was particularly visible.
The station's leader, Mr. Koo, said that such aircraft could spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land per day, about eight times more efficiently than drones and hundreds of times more artificially.
This farm is located in the friendly county of Heilongjiang Province, the country's first food-producing province, and from the sound of rice-cutting in the past to the sound of today's “Lunglong” motor, where traditional farming and farms in China have mutated along the black belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modernization of agricultural production on friendly farms.
Confucius described, on the one hand, their use of satellite remote sensing technology for precision application, reduction of agricultural inputs and reduction of pollution, and, on the other hand, their use of satellite navigation technology to increase the level of standardized operations in agro-mechanical fields.
During this year's rice production, the farm expanded the area of operation of satellite-based navigation UAV technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes seedlings more evenly planted, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 dollars per acre in labour costs.
The farm has tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest group of agricultural machinery in the country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total farm fleet currently stands at 49,000 units, with an overall field mechanization rate of 99.8 per cent.
Agricultural machine operations resulted in 100 per cent GPS satellite navigation, 100 per cent intensive seeding in dry fields and 100 per cent operation of dry field large motor vehicles.
“Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture are the way forward for the modernization of agriculture.”
The friendship farm chief Liu Lien said.
The key to agricultural modernization is scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang farming, which is represented by farms, has played a leading role in the demonstration of modern large-scale agriculture, with the initial establishment of a modern agricultural industry system dominated by large-scale farming, standardized production and industrialization.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is a 350,000 square metre agricultural machine fair.
There is a concentration of more than 140 agricultural tools that have been introduced and used in Heilongjiang farming over the years.
These agricultural tools and farms bear witness to the country's modernization of agriculture.

On 25 July, at around 4 p.m., Fu Quinbao was wearing mud-filled rubber shoes, moving to the back of the house, and his wife Zhou Ying was busy packing his things back and forth.
“I received a call from the village cadres to transfer, and I was still mowing grass in the fields.”
Fu Quinbao says he's been running over 60 acres of land, growing rice, and now he's growing up pretty good, and he's been taking his medicine yesterday, and he hasn't packed his tools.
Fu Quinbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer in the corner, "No one wants their house to be flooded, let's go home."
In response to persistent high-water pressure and possible heavy rainfall in the lake, the city of Hefu, Anhui Province, is preparing to launch on 26 June the Jiangguchi River, where the family is located, from which water is collected.
Chiangguchi is located in Fatsi County, adjacent to the lake embankment.
There are thousands of villagers involved in the town of Yan Shui and the town of Miheu who need to be relocated.
As at 1600 hours on 25 February, our fifth-largest freshwater lake lair remained at a high level of 13.2 metres, exceeding the guaranteed level of 0.7 metres.
The Fu Quinbao kitchen was clean and clean, with a bowl of pumpkin heads on the table and eggs and some halogenes in the fridge.
"I didn't think we'd move it, but the water at Chiangguchi is looking good."
Zhou Ying said that the house was a flat and that some of the big items were not yet ready to be placed.
“Pack the valuables first, and the big ones, refrigerators and televisions, can be placed in the high-lying neighbours' or relatives' homes for the time being.”
The village cadre, Wang Quinbao, has a good idea.
Wang was responsible for the relocation of 13 villagers, and one family informed that the resettlement programme for each individual was confirmed.
The nearest settlement to the Fu Quinbao family is the Su Primary School, located around 2 km away.
In addition to the large pieces, the headaches of Fu Quinbao included more than 1,000 pounds of food at home and some newly purchased furniture.
"The food is ready to go to the relatives' house and the furniture cannot be moved."
The couple agreed to put a stool under the newly purchased bed, raising it about half a metre high.
At 6 p.m., Fu Quinbao started transporting goods to relatives in a tricycle, and Zhou Ying continued to pack at home.
At around 11 p.m., the couple looked around and around the house, pulled the switch and went to the settlement.
"I hope the water returns soon."
Fu Quinbao said that.
On 26 July, at 9:30 a.m., journalists observed that the area was ready for the flood.
Zhang Jie-Kolin's home team is strong with myo-Xinhua Network.
On 11 July, the sports youth competition show " Sports Bar Youth " officially landed on the watch of South Lake.
The sports leader, Zhang Jingko, and his sports assistant, Lin Mansion, are on the same stage across the border, with lindane and the Quantico Quantico dictation styles, while the hard core of the Power Puller, which is a "big thing", is on the ground, making the programme “fired” more powerful.
At the top of the list, 11 sports youths raced to show their power, as they looked at the audience, attention was also paid to the “strength” of “strength conflict” and “hard heart” in the arena.
Among them, the “strong conflict” came from SuperA sports student Giovanni, who, before the game, openly provoked Xu Zhibin, known as the “beautiful man” in the same track, should have stunned Xu Shibin's appearance and even released the harsh words “lost the make-up”.
Some of the comments put young people and sports leaders on the scene to the bottom of the air.
Instead, “strength versus power” is more like a fairy fight, with Sun Keeki, who is known as the Great Demon King, hitting the same powerful building and playing a strong fight.
And their identities are unexpected, and Kenji Sun is a gymnasium-loving actor, and Zhang Xing Dynasty is a retired SWAT soldier and three champions of the Order of Brave.
At the start of the race, the boys worked as hard as they could to pull out the poles, and the protracted confrontation on the poles led to a sweating by the viewers on the scene.
In a tense situation, Zhang Jieko, one of the leaders of the Sports Bar Youth movement, was also watching the battle seriously.
At the point of assessment, he was also very careful and patiently encouraged by the young people who lost the competition to help each and every point of error in the process.
The sports assistant's house, in turn, was a flowery aid, and she did not hide her appreciation of the young people who were on-line.
The day-to-day training of sports teenagers is more admirable when it comes to learning that they are overstretched.
It is also the sport leader's lindane and the master of the garden that have styles, one is the "predictor" and the other is the "dwelling girl" with a smile that disperses the tension.
In addition, Jikwung and Liu Xing, as sports assistants, have made a lot of laughs about sports teenagers.
The fire at the Church of Nantes in France: the parish volunteers admit to arson, regularity and vernacularism - the new Chinese net.
According to external sources, on 18 July, the historic site of Nantes in France, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul Cathedral, was severely damaged in a fire and the organ was completely destroyed.
On 26 local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer who was in charge of guarding the cathedral had been charged with “burning and destruction”.
He has admitted that he set himself on fire in the church.
According to reports, the local prosecutor, Senas, said that 39-year-old parish volunteers from Rwanda had admitted that they had lit three fires in the cathedral at night.
The lawyer for this person stated that the arsonists were now very sorry to have done such a thing.
He entered France a few years ago by way of refuge, was sheltered in the parish of the site of the fire and was admitted to the church.
The prosecution stated that he had recently attempted to update his visa and was in dialogue with the police.
The church, however, stated that it was still unconvinced that the faithful, who were usually very kind and smiled, but who did not speak much, would destroy a church that he so loved.
On the day of the 18 July fire, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police for questioning because of the logical problems in the account, but he was later released.
The figure is for firefighters to rescue at the site.
On the evening of 25 May, he was again summoned for questioning as a result of new evidence obtained by professional engineers from the Central Police Laboratory in Paris.
This time, the man confessed to his arson.
It is reported that if convicted of intentional arson destruction, the suspect may face a prison sentence of 10 years and a fine of 150,000 euros.
It was reported that the fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre's and St. Paul's Cathedrals, that the organ was completely burned and that the coloured window behind the organ was seriously damaged.
According to Brune, the chief architect of the French historical preservation architecture, it is conservative to estimate that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Global news: U.S. unilateralism disrupts relations between the two countries. International public opinion supports China's anti-American-Xinhua network.
On the morning of 24 July, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its permit for the establishment and operation of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu and made a specific request that the Consulate General cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems in the relations between China and the United States, and that it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unjustified provocations of the United States side and to take counter-measures.
Andrés Borges, Director of the Chinese Research Centre of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States undermined the bridges of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and put relations between the two great Powers in crisis.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu was a reaction to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and was consistent with diplomatic practice.
According to Patricio Justo, Professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and Director of the Centre for Central American Studies, the above-mentioned decision of the Chinese side is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the earlier provocations of the United States and is not directed against the ordinary American population.
The United States is trying to divert attention from the United States by pressuring China to cover up its weak response to the new crown epidemic.
The Chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Centre of the Indonesian think tank, Bambang Suryono, said that the provocative diplomatic stance of the United States had seriously troubled relations between China and the United States and that relations between the two countries faced serious challenges.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal counter-measure, in keeping with diplomatic practice, and reflects both China's principled position of firm defence of its own interests and the legitimate advantages and benefits of Chinese diplomacy.
The Tanzanian currentist Francis Semwenza said that the above-mentioned decision of the Chinese side was a legitimate and necessary response to the provocations of the United States.
To return to normal relations between China and the United States, the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in its internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win economic and political gains with China and how to benefit both peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, Executive Director of the Arab-Chinese Federation of Friendship and Associations, based in the Sudan, said that the counter-measures that China had been forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustifiable actions of the American side, in accordance with international law and the basic norms of international relations and in accordance with diplomatic practice.
Previously, the United States demanded the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston in grave violation of international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will rescind its previous decisions and create the necessary conditions for the normalization of relations between the two countries.
The Singapore Joint Morning News published an editorial saying that the larger strategic intent of the United States was to block China and prevent it from continuing to rise.
In the face of the United States, China has had to take counter-measures, although it is very reluctant to see the deterioration of relations between China and the United States continue.

The Xinhua Society Guangzhou journalist (journalist Mao) learned from the Guangdong Sea Police that, in recent days, the Xinhua Society, in conjunction with the Guangzhou Customs and Public Security Department, had dismantled a huge group of oil-smuggling products that had been smuggling some 120,000 tons of oil since 2019, with a value of about 800 million yuan yuan in the case and about 240 million yuan in tax evasion.
The Guangdong Sea Police, in conjunction with the Customs Department, have progressively clarified the division of labour and the structure of the group.
On 8 July, the maritime police, the customs and the public security services launched a single collection network operation in Guangzhou, Fushan and the seafront area of the Pearl River. Four ships suspected of smuggling were seized on site, with a total of 4,700 tons of oil seized from the vessels and the oil depots involved, respectively, and funds were frozen.
The joint operation was known to have launched a total of eight ships and two helicopters, divided into several operational teams, to combat the whole chain of smuggling by sea and illegal operations on land, all of which involved 35 major suspects.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant officers of the Guangdong Sea Police said that they would continue to maintain a high-pressure posture in the future to combat smuggling and criminal activities at sea and to maintain good order in the maritime areas under their jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hanna landed in Medellus or caused a flood of rivers and flash floods and a new net.
On July 26, China-News Network reported that, at 5 p.m. local time, Hurricane Hanna landed in Texas, United States of America, causing heavy storms, river surges and potentially life-threatening flash floods in Texas.
According to the National Hurricane Centre, Hurricane Hanna is expected to carry heavy rains across parts of the southern and north-eastern parts of the state, which may have caused some stream surges and life-threatening flash floods.
According to reports, the worst affected by hurricane Hanna was the area south of the city of Cops Christi to the mouth of the Grand River, while the Rio Grande Valley could be affected by widespread flash floods.
The Governor of Texas, Abbot, said on 25th, “Any hurricane is a great challenge”.
Thirty-two counties in the state have entered a catastrophic emergency as a result of the hurricane.
The city of Cops Christi, a city with a population of over 320,000, has closed down its libraries and museums and has been waiting for its inhabitants.
Abet added that, at a time when Texas was suffering from the devastating effects of the new crown, the hurricane could not be allowed to cause more casualties in Texas.
In southern Texas, rainfall is reported to reach 6 to 12 inches in the night of 26 months, and 3 to 5 inches in northern Texas and coastal Louisiana.
As a result of global warming, among other factors, “Hanna” was formed earlier than in the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
In general, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually takes place in mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women
The Polish Ministry of Justice indicated on Saturday that next week Poland will take steps to withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women.
According to the Polish right-wing Government Cabinet, the treaty requires schools to teach students about gender issues and violates the rights of parents.
A press conference was held by the Polish Minister of Justice, Djobleo, who said that the Ministry of Justice, which he headed, would submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family to begin withdrawing from the Treaty on Monday.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
According to Jiablo, “the treaty contains elements of a morphological nature that we consider to be harmful”.
The law in power in Poland has a close alliance with the Justice Party and its governing coalition partners with the Roman Catholic Church, promoting a conservative social agenda.
During the successful re-election campaign this month, President Douda of Poland made the issue of homophobic rights one of the main topics.
On Friday, tens of thousands of Poles, mostly women, protested against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
One of the organizers of the protest, Lempatt, stated in a protest march in Warsaw that “the purpose of withdrawal from the Treaty is to legitimize domestic violence”.
Some protesters carried banners that read “The Law and Justice Party is the Hell of Women”.
The Party of Law and Justice has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist Government ratified the Convention in 2015.
The Government of the Party for Law and Justice stated that the treaty did not respect religion and called for the teaching of liberal social policies in schools.
To date, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

Jiangxi opened a “green passage” for young people on the flood front - Xinhuanet
The recruitment office of the People's Government of Jiangxi province, Xinhua Society Nanchang, on 26 July (Go Dongming and Kuang), has recently made it clear that priority will be given to conscripting individuals or their children who have featured prominently in this flood disaster response mission, who are eligible for recruitment and qualified for medical and political examinations.
“After the registration of young recruits, we shall give priority to the recruitment of conscripts after verification by the joint recruitment offices of the communities where the young recruits are located, the Street Armed Department and the Xiangyang District.”
Wang Fai, Deputy Minister of Man-Wu of Xiyang District, Xijiang City, said that they had spent three days starting from 25 days organizing a medical check-up for the young recruits, as a result of the floods.
Xijiang City's young conscript, Zhou Jinghai, a 22-year-old university graduate, was born to a community worker, father to a veteran of an Air Force department, and for more than a decade the parents had been on the line of duty to combat the flood.
“These days, I want to be one of those people who saw in the news that the sons of the people were fighting to defend their homeland from the flood.”
Zhou Yuen said that he had had a military dream since he was a child and, through this fight against the floods, strengthened his determination to go to the barracks.
The city of Xijiang also uses the flood risk as a “live material” for military recruitment campaigns. They are community-based and call upon young recruits to participate voluntarily in such tasks as patrolling the Chati and on duty, and are aware of the nature of the People's Army and to strengthen their confidence in participating in the military.
He said that, by giving priority to the recruitment of soldiers, it was hoped that more young recruits would be encouraged and that a good social atmosphere would be created for the honour of participating in the mission and for the glory of joining the army.
According to the Viet Nam News Agency, Grivali believes that Viet Nam has contributed significantly to ASEAN development over the past 25 years.
Viet Nam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also an ASEAN locomotive.
Grivori stated that Russia and, indeed, the Asia-Europe Economic Union believed that Viet Nam had contributed to the advancement of ASEAN and the promotion of its image to the outside world.
He stressed that “ASEAN should therefore be grateful to Viet Nam”.
Grivori indicated that the analysts had endorsed the peace initiative put forward by Viet Nam.
Viet Nam is ready to share its experience with the ASEAN countries and to propose constructive and peaceful measures to address the problems facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East China Sea issue.
With regard to cooperation between Viet Nam and Russia within the ASEAN framework, Grivori believes that Viet Nam supports Russia's cooperative relationship with ASEAN to help Russia gain benefits under this cooperation framework.
The Asia-Europe Economic Union, which included Russia, and Viet Nam had been able to enter the ASEAN market with the signing of a free trade agreement.
Grivori proposes to maximize the expansion of the Free Trade Area between the Asia-Europe Economic Union and the ASEAN countries, thereby creating a platform for economic and security stability.
At the same time, Grivori believes that Russia, Viet Nam and ASEAN are on track and will achieve their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, the North River Province will have the necessary conditions, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, human resources and land, to proactively attract foreign capital flows, in particular transnational groups with value chains and the transfer of advanced technology.
In addition, North River Province will be ready to submit to the Prime Minister of the Government his proposal for investment in infrastructure development and business projects in the Vietnamese industrial zone and to approve the addition of two industrial-urban-service zones in the province, Anshan-North and Anjoo, to be included in the document on the master plan for the development of the Viet Nam industrial zone by 2020.
At the same time, the North River Province has made efforts to accelerate progress on projects such as infrastructure development and operation projects in industrial parks such as two streams in Fu, Guangzhou and the Royal Uttar Pradesh, and to generate land funds for business purposes.
In 2020, the Directorate of Industry and Trade of the North River Province provided input on the design of industrial zones and industrial cluster planning for inclusion in the provincial planning.
The North River Province has decided to combine the development of clusters of industrial parks with the guarantee of national security, the protection of the ecological environment and food security, thereby contributing to the balanced development of industry; the availability of comprehensive infrastructure such as electricity, water supply, transport and telecommunications; and the construction of cities, trade services, workers'housing and health care, and other social infrastructure such as education.
In the industrial zones, North River Province has made a strong appeal for investment projects in high-tech, clean technologies in such areas as electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery, ancillary industries, etc.
In the industrial park cluster, the province called for small- and medium-scale investment projects in the production, use of local labour, especially in the areas of agricultural products and food processing.
In the future, North River Province will focus on accelerating investment in the infrastructure of the North River logistics centre, in parallel with the industrial park cluster, in order to optimize the flow of goods, money and help reduce production costs, improve the value of goods, optimize supply chains and develop multimodal transport, thereby creating an incentive for investors to invest in the province.
Upgraded Russian helicopter gun card - Xinhua Network for the first time out at the end of the year
According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defence, the upgraded version of the Russian helicopter gunship (hereinafter " Wuzheng " ) card-52 — the first remodelling and commissioning of the Xinhua Society in December of this year — will be significantly upgraded in terms of detection, communications and weapon performance.
According to a recent Russian newspaper, Wuzhika-52M, known as the “Super Short-Called Alligator”, was developed under a contract signed last April between the Russian military and military-industrial units, and the first two upgrades are currently being replaced at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian “Progress” Aerospace Group company, whose national tests and improvements will be completed by October 2022.
According to the Russian expert who was aware of the upgrading, the “forebears” of the “super-clinics” — Wuzhika-52 — was officially installed in November 2011 and the type of aircraft exposed a number of weaknesses in its use, and this upgrade was designed to “remediate the board”.
It was reported that K-52M, compared to K-52, would partially introduce new types of protective materials that did not add weight, and that its pilot cabin would be reinforced with new equipment to withstand missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of survival in the field; that it would install higher power generators to power more sophisticated on-board electronic equipment; that the photovoltaic system would be upgraded to detect and identify distant battlefield targets; that it would be equipped with new light-use multi-purpose missiles, with a range of 20 kilometres and a range of approximately one times higher than that of similar missiles used in active Russian military utility; and that its defensive weapons and communications equipment would be used to the maximum extent possible by Mi-28NM helicopters capable of attacking air targets, thus making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, card-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems and navigation equipment.
The Russian expert also indicated that it was of concern that K-52M would be equipped with communications equipment to communicate with drones, thereby providing real-time access to information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, for example by displaying images of drones on the helicopter's cabin screen.
It is planned that the K-52M pilots will be able to directly manipulate the drones with which they work, thereby improving their knowledge of the battlefield situation and guidance for long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, in December last year the Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, Krivorucciko, stated that the Russian Ministry of Defence planned to purchase more than 110 martial arts cards-52M by 2027.
The new Act provides for the wearing of masks in public indoors in the Campania Region from the very beginning, with a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
On 1 June, local time, Rome, the Italian capital, the Roman Ordnance Field, was reopened.
According to reports, according to the latest quarantine decree issued by the Regional Government, the population of the Campania region is required to wear masks in compliance with the quarantine requirement in all public transport, as well as in access to indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and galleries.

In Hebei, 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological rehydration of the river's lake since this year - Central New Network
On 26 July, Xinhua Shun Jiaxuan, a journalist (journalist Wang Qun) learned from the Hebei Province Water Department that, since the current year, Hebei Province has implemented ecological water recharges to 28 rivers and white sediments, including the Ganges River, Tang River, Ma River Refuge, and cumulatively, 1.75 billion cubic metres of ecological water recharge of the river's lake.
Hebei Province has seized the advantage of increasing the flow of water through the Northern South Water Central Line project and has implemented ecological rehydration in the form of rivers such as the Tang, Sand and Dragon Rivers.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs, such as the Western Ocean, East Wousshus, and the rivers of the White Ocean, such as the Suyang River and the Blue Dragon River, have been used for ecological recharge, resulting in a cumulative surface area of more than 90 square kilometres.
In order to achieve ecological water recharge, the Hebei Department of Water Affairs has been active in organizing the identification, rehabilitation and consolidation of riverine hazards and the clean-up of river lanes, refining practical measures and strengthening surveillance and surveillance.
The timely resolution of problems through supervised inspections and concentrated unannounced visits ensured the safe and orderly recharge of rivers.
According to the relevant head of the Hebei Department, the orderly implementation of the river lake eco-rehydration has effectively rehabilitated the water environment of Hebei Province and has contributed to the recovery and preservation of the coastal groundwater, significantly improving the habitat and economic development environment along the route, and is important for the conservation of the “water clean, green, river smooth and beautiful” river and lake management.
In the last two weeks, Spain has seen a significant increase in the number of new cases, with thousands of new cases occurring over the past two weeks.
On the evening of Saturday (25 July), the British Government provisionally decided that Spain would be removed from the safe travel list from 2000 hours local time, and that persons entering the United Kingdom from Spain would have to be separated for 14 days.
British tourists on vacation in Spain were surprised, worried and even angry at the decision, because the news came as unexpectedly as it came.
The British Minister of Transport, Grant Shapps, is also reported to be on vacation in Spain.
Prior to the British quarantine measures, Norway had also announced a 10-day period of isolation for those returning from Spain.
France and Belgium recommended that their residents abandon the programme of vacations in and around Barcelona.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded and social distances between people cannot be maintained, and at one point the police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain.
Spain: This is safe.
In response to the decision taken by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Sunday that the epidemic in the country was under control.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Spain, Arancha González Laya, stressed to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish Government will try to convince the British Government to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the rate of infection in these two tourist resorts is much lower than in mainland England.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Catalan region of Spain has also reactivated the "stop order".
Tourism is an important pillar of Spain, which is one of the most favoured resorts for British tourists.
This decision by the United Kingdom is expected to have a significant impact on tourism in Spain.

On July 26th, Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua, the first day of the year, Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua (journalist Nie Yuanjin) called for a “middle-volt” in Beijing.
In the early morning of 26 September, heavy winds were pouring over the weather, dissipating the heat and heat that had beset the Beijing area for days, and a new round of rainfall would continue for several days.
At 1100 hours on 26 June, the Beijing Meteorological Station announced that there were scattered showers (with weak lightning) in Beijing on 26, with a maximum temperature of only 27°C per day; at night, there were small rain (with weak lightning), and at night the lowest temperature was 23°C.
From 24 to 25 years ago, the entire city of Beijing was at high temperature blue warning, with the highest daily temperatures in most areas at around 37°C, with temperatures exceeding 40°C.
The weather is one of the highest temperatures, damp and hot days of the year, with three volts of the year and one of the hottest in the middle, as Chinese people call it the “drought summer”.
At the time of the ambush, the house was filled with barns and there was a popular reference to “one dumpling with two faces”.
According to current forecasts, there will be dark weather in Beijing over the next three days.
The meteorological sector alerts the public to minimize mountain play and to guard against geological hazards.
It is understood that this year's “mid-bust” lasted 20 days, beginning on 26 July and ending on 14 August.
When entering a “mid-voltage”, people feel physically weak and hungry.
The choice of foods such as green beans, ginseng, which have the effect of heat-free summers, spleen appetizers, and bitter foods such as cucumbers and cucumbers can contribute to increased appetite and elimination of the summer air.
The engine may be out. FAA has an emergency order for 2,000 Boeing passenger aircraft - Xinhuanet.
The United States Federal Aviation Office (FAA) issued an emergency seaworthiness directive on 24 December, which required an emergency inspection of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737 NG and 737 Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, as the air revalves of the passenger aircraft in question were corrupted and could result in engine parking.
According to the Federal Aviation Office, four reports of air parking of passenger engines 737 NG and 737 Classic have been received to date, resulting in urgent inspection requirements for passenger aircraft that have been parked for seven consecutive days or more and for passenger aircraft that have thus far flown less than 11 times after re-entry.
The Federal Aviation Office warned that if all two passenger engines were corroded, the level 5 valves could be stuck in open positions, causing the plane to lose all power and to be unable to re-invigorate the motive.
The aviation regulatory body ordered that, once the repercussion valves were found to be corrosion, the air operator must replace the key component before the passenger aircraft was re-used.
Boeing responded later that day that the outbreak of the new crown had led to lower demand for travel, which had resulted in a number of passenger aircraft being blocked or less used, and that “retarding valves are more vulnerable to corrosion”.
Boeing also stated that it had been suggested that air operators should inspect passenger aircraft covered by the directive and that, if problems were identified, Boeing would provide assistance in such areas as repair and replacement of return valves.
The Associated Press reported that passenger aircraft under the flag of the major air operators in the United States usually fly several times in one day, but after the outbreak of the new crown, a large number of passenger aircraft were grounded; as the demand for passengers to travel has grown slowly in recent times, some of them have returned to operation.
The Federal Aviation Office did not issue details of the four air parking reports.
One of these incidents was disclosed later in 24 days by Alaska Airlines.
In its statement, the air operator stated that on 15 July, a passenger aircraft under the flag flew from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, an engine suddenly went off and the passenger aircraft eventually made an emergency landing at Austin airport.
Alaska Airlines stated that the engines of the passenger aircraft had been replaced and that the engines of the six passenger aircraft had been checked in accordance with the Federal Aviation Authority's directives.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Air, respectively, stated that there had been no engine shutdowns associated with air stop valves on the passenger aircraft under the flag.
Four passenger aircraft under the United States Airlines flag will be inspected and 28 under the United Airlines flag will be inspected.
Damen Airlines stated that it would inspect 20 passenger aircraft under the flag, but did not indicate whether there had been any engine fires.
In many media reports, the Federal Aviation Office's emergency seaworthiness directive was another impact on Boeing.
A Boeing 737 MAX passenger aircraft of Indonesian Lions Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, resulting in a total of 346 deaths.
This series of passenger aircraft, which was subsequently grounded globally, ceased production in January this year and resumed production in May.
In June, the President of the Federal Aviation Authority, Steve Dixon, admitted that the Federal Aviation Authority had made “a mistake” in regulating Boeing in respect of the 737 MAX passenger aircraft.
Xue Mo Fong's "Knowledge Launcher - Xinhua Network" is on the line next week.
And there's a new art online.
An interactive knowledge-sharing programme, Ding Bang On! How are you, will be aired in Hunan Vigilance from 20 July.
It is understood that the programme will create a new all-age youth class, with a pool of talented and talented teachers coming forward to challenge the production of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impressions of the past group of teachers in the minds of the general public, Ding Bang On the Line! Teacher Good gathers together a group of intellectual representatives of both face and talent.
They are both young knowledge role models from various disciplines, and a group of full-time “teammen” who are full of twitching and masters of euphemism.
In the programme, these excellent youth knowledge role models, as “knowledge-sharing officers”, will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to impress the audience through an attitudinal knowledge output that shows the most interesting aspects of their discipline.
In the case of the "Dos Ask" community, which is composed of all age groups, questions are raised, making it more difficult for the "knowledge-sharing officers" to teach, and adding a somewhat stimulating atmosphere to the programme.
It has been revealed that among the “knowledge-sharing officers” are excellent young teachers such as Lee Young Lok, a secondary school physics teacher attached to the Chinese People's University, Zhang Xue Feng, a leading research teacher, and Wang Xiao, a history teacher with 10 years of experience, who will show the field viewers their “hard nuclear” knowledge in unexpected ways.
In addition, Professor Xue Mu Fong was invited as the “Knowledge Launcher” of the programme, to join the “Tinging Assistant” Do Haitao and Kyonyo, to talk to the audience about youth and to create a “open course on youth for all”.
Secretary of State of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: critical situation
Xinhua Society Hong Kong 26 July Zhang Jianzhong, Chief Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 26, stated that the situation of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be critical and that if the epidemic breaks down, the HKSAR Government will decisively take more stringent control measures to further restrict the operation of the premises and reduce the space available for citizens to leave the country.
At this stage, however, it is not the intention of the HKSAR Government to introduce “home orders” or “restriction orders” to restrict citizens from leaving the country.
On the same day, Zhang Jianjong published a post entitled "A critical situation: a strong response to the epidemic."
He said that the epidemic was the worst in six months and that the next two weeks would be critical in doing everything possible to prevent the virus from spreading further in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the HKSAR Government, self-regulation and cooperation on the part of the public are also important.
He called on citizens to remain at home as much as possible, to reduce social contact and to go out to eat.
Citizens should cooperate with the coercive measures of wearing masks to protect themselves and others and focus on personal and environmental health and manual hand washing, in particular by suspending non-necessary family and friends meetings or meals and reducing them to street markets.
He stated that the Central Government had been very interested in the evolution of the epidemic in Hong Kong and in supporting the HKSAR Government's efforts to combat the epidemic, and had responded positively to the Chief Executive's latest request to assist in increasing detection capabilities and adapting the International Expo in Asia to work on a similar “class hospital”.
According to Jianjong Zhang, the free virus testing provided by the HKSAR Government to specific high-risk groups, i.e. residential homes, homes with disabilities and nursing homes, restaurant staff, taxi drivers and property managers, has been fully implemented, involving up to 400,000 people.
He is very concerned about cases of infection in residential homes, where the Government has arranged specific temporary quarantine centres.
He indicated that the Government of the Special Administrative Region was in the process of constructing quarantine facilities near the Bamboo Bay quarantine centre located on the New Territories Hill, and that it was expected that 700 additional quarantine units would be available by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on 19 that the HKSAR Government would construct an additional 2,000 isolation units at the Bamboo Bay Quarantine Centre, with the aim of completing them by the end of the year.
Adding to the 800 already operational quarantine centres, the Bamboo Bay quarantine centre is expected to provide a total of 3,500 isolation units by the end of the year.
There are currently four operating quarantine centres in Hong Kong, providing approximately 2,600 isolation units.
In addition, on 24 April, the HKSAR Government reopened the Carpgate Park Resort on Hong Kong Island as a community isolation facility for patients under 50 years of age who are self-sufficient.
"Neugenics" in the history of the Sino-China Party and the history of the new China - Sino-New Network
Source: People's Forum Network.
Recently, Secretary-General Xi Jinping, during his visit to the Quartet memorial, stressed that “the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of the New China should be well studied by 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million members of the party, especially at all levels of leadership.”
Carefully studying the history of the Party, the history of the New China, is a mandatory lesson for the Party's cadres in keeping their hearts open and their mission in mind, from which they must learn to feed and enrich their families and take the long journey of the new era.
A vast party history and the history of the New China record the hard struggles and glorious journeys of the Communist Party of China since its birth, demonstrating the original heart and mission of the Communists, whose beliefs and loyalty were forged with life and blood.
History is the best textbook, and for party cadres the party history, the New China history, is the best chapter in this textbook.
Each party cadre is constantly strengthening its historical thinking on history and on the way to the future, building on the new mission of the new journey, taking on the “celebrator” of the times and taking on the long journey of the present generation.
In the history of the party and the history of the new China, the spirits of the past hold on to their original mission.
The history of the Party, the history of the New China, full of the immutable original mission of the Communist Party of China and the firmness of its conviction as a rock, have shown that the Communists are always with their people.
Close knowledge of the party history, the important events in the history of the new China, important meetings, important figures, not only the intuitive shock of the mind, the baptism of the mind, but also the reading of the content of the first heart's beliefs from the depths of the soul and the weight of the mission.
For the party cadres, in order to keep their original mission alive, they must find from the history of the party and the history of the new China the point of departure, the point of departure, the point of departure, the point of departure and the point of departure, maintain a sobering awareness and a firm position, stir up the strength of the nation to fight for its people, and ensure that the generations of the Red Rivers and the Red Mountains, which were beaten by the ancestors of the revolution with blood and life, are passed on from one generation to the next.
It is wise to learn history and to pass on a noble spirit in the history of the Party, the history of the New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, the spirit of the Red Ship, the spirit of Ii Okayama, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yanan, the spirit of the resistance, the spirit of Sipapo, the spirit of the "two-play-one-star" and the spirit of space have shaped a series of great spirits.
These great spirits, which have been sunk by history, provide a strong spiritual incentive for our party to overcome the risks and challenges on the way forward. They are a precious spiritual asset that cannot be broken, broken and robbed of.
The process of learning the history of the Party and of China is the process of tempering and self-constructing these spirits, consciously looking at the noble spirits of the ancestors of the Revolution, maintaining the spiritual homeland of the Communists, building solid spiritual foundations for the advancement of great causes and the realization of great dreams, and giving new light to the times.
He studied the history of the Party and the history of the New China.
For the party cadres, there has never been a history that can provide a more profound warning, inspiration and lesson than the history of the party, the history of the New China.
In the history of the Party and of the New China, we can see the great deeds of the old Revolutionaryists who have dedicated themselves to their faith and struggle to achieve the goals set, as well as the profound lessons that certain people have learned from their idealistic beliefs and have come to the opposite side of the Revolution. They have inspired and warned us that with firm determination and will we will never stand still, that we will never fail, that we remain steadfast in our struggle, that we continue to be pure of party nature and that we are in our way.
To truly be a committed believer and a faithful practitioner of the great ideals of communism, there is a need to remove the idea of “dust” and to prevent the “stains” from being infected, and the history of the Party and of the New China should be the basis for every cadre of party members to examine and warn themselves.
Known of the history of the Party and the history of the New China, it is time to rise to the challenge.
The Secretary-General of Xi Jinping has stated that “learning the history of the Party, the history of the nation is a compulsory subject for the preservation and development of the socialism of the Chinese character and for the advancement of the Party and the country's causes”.
Looking back at history and prostrating for the first time, it is for the sake of renewed glory and for the sake of the future.
Each party official should study the history of the Party and the history of the New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly setting the course of his or her life, taking on a historic mission in his or her respective jobs, taking responsibility and acting proactively.
Keeping in mind and guided by the advances of the old revolutionary family, constantly polishing the political identity of the Communists, maintaining a vagaries, struggle gestures and the more difficult it is to move forward, writing its own illustrious piece on the journey of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation.
"Change Gangnam" in pursuit of the poem "Yellow River Dream" - China New Network
(China Poverty Reduction Story) "Sihang Gangnam" after the poem "Yang River Dream"
On July 26, Sino-News' Sino-Congregation (Yandi) called "The Nine Yellow Rivers in Mandarin."
The Yellow River, which inspires so many human beings, has given birth to a beautiful and rich plain of Ningxia, a beautifully called “Seong Gangnam”, who now adheres to the concept of “eco-priority, green development” and pursues the poetic “yellow river dream”.
"Bippo Dreams" by the Qing Shui Show.
“Yellow River Funingxia”, which runs 397 kilometres through Ningxia, is the “Mother River” for one side.
However, with rapid industrialization and urbanization, river lakes are being exploited and managed in an unbalanced manner, with a confluence of over-marked drainage, cropping around lakes and misappropriation of waters, resulting in black odours, over-standard water quality, environmental degradation and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is pushing for the restoration of the diversity of water and is trying to return the Yellow River to Qing.
The water needs to be treated from the source.
In Xinxia Silvergawa, where sewage from industrial parks is fully treated in a centralized manner, municipal sewage treatment plants have fully achieved standard level A discharges, cities have built black and stinky bodies that are largely eliminated, and the third batch of Chinese black and stinky water demonstration cities have been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia's full implementation of the river lake length system in 2017 has now achieved full coverage of the system of five-tier river lake lengths in the districts and districts and has become the norm.
When he lived in a village by the Yellow River at 64, he witnessed a change in the Yellow River: “The previous water stenched and after it was cleaned up, the smell stench disappeared”.
Gu Jinzheng said that the environment was better and his life easier, and now he often walks with his family to the Yellow River to feel the blue sky.
"Wetland Dreams" by Sand gulls
The beauty of flying birds, green trees, storks, boulevards Fan has flooded the sand gulls and has become a reality in the Yellow River Wet Park in Ningxia Silver River.
Through Ningxia, yellow rivers form a variety of wetlands, such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and marsh wetlands, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water, and also serve as important international migration routes for birds.
Since 2009, the Ningxia sector has invested cumulatively in wetland conservation projects in the order of RMB 3450 million. At present, the area of the Sinakawa wetlands is 19.2 million hectares, the rate of wetland conservation is 78.5 per cent, there are nearly 200 natural lakes, marsh wetlands, five national wetlands parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous wetlands parks and eight municipal parks.
The Deputy Director-General of the Humidland Conservation Centre of Silvan City, Lu Jinhu, told journalists that wetland conservation has increased biodiversity, particularly in birds, where “the gulls are a endangered bird, with only over 20,000 birds in the world, of which more than 2,000 are sheltered”.
At the same time, Ningxia has established by law a red line between 500 metres of wetland protection in the Yellow and Silver sector, stipulating that no unit or individual may develop or operate within the range of protection, except for projects of public interest.
Zhao Shau Yong, Deputy Director of the Water Service Centre in Silver River City, introduced that, through pollution source management, integrated management of river lake ecology and end-of-end wetland construction, the nine main yellow drains in Ningxia now meet 100 per cent of class IV standards, “now the water is clean, the fish swim and the flowers bloom.”
The "drinking water dream" for all people.
Ningxia used to have an “indulgent” title: the only city along the yellow city, “drinking with water from the Yellow River”.
From 2010 onwards, the city began to face persistent water shortages at the peak of the summer, and the “water shortage pain” of nearly a decade has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents, but in the face of the fact that the main sources of water are above the limit and that large areas of groundwater overflow are under urban areas, water scarcity has become a problem for the city.
As a result of improved yellow river water quality, the drinking of purified yellow river water has become a solution to the drinking problems of the local population.
Ding Ming, Deputy Director-General of the Water Authority of Silvan City, explained that in order to improve the production of water for rural and urban residents of Silvan City, Ningxia had, in due course, launched a water supply project along the rural and urban west lines of the Silvan Metropolitan Circle to replace the original sources of groundwater with high-quality yellow water.
“On 29 December 2019, the water supply project officially brought water to the third district of the city of Shinchuan, and in 2020 the residents of the towns of Guanning and Holland also drank from the Yellow River.”
Ding Ming said that the Singchuan water sector would integrate regional rural water and urban water supply integration, “the next step will be to integrate rural and decentralized water points and fully connect to the West Line water supply project, which is expected to be largely integrated in rural and urban areas by the end of this year”.
Strengthening disaster prevention and response in all sectors - the new Chinese network
Increased preparedness of departments to respond to disasters
Newsline (News): News from the Ministry of Water Affairs, today (25 July) at 1200 hours, the river under the Wang Huai River dam is 0.64-3.31 metres, the river under the south and south of the Yangtze River is 0.05-2.02 metres, and the river under the south and south of the river is 0.05-2.02 metres.
Tai Lai has been in existence for 28 days since 28 June.
Today, at 1200 hours, the average water level in Tai La is 4.67 metres, exceeding the guaranteed level of 0.02 metres.
Today, the National Congress of Defence has concluded that it will continue to maintain the Yangtze and Huai River II level response, demanding local accountability and further implementation of disaster prevention and response efforts.
Today, the National Defence Office, the Ministry of Emergency Management and Emergency Management are urgently deploying specialized flood trucks from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve problems such as the urban flooding caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States had conducted a countervailing investigation into China using the renminbi exchange rate.
In response to a recent announcement by the United States Department of Commerce, it was decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation into products originating in China from straps (beam belts) and an investigation into the “undervalued currency exchange rate” project.
China's Ministry of Commerce stated that this was the first time that the United States had investigated the so-called “undervalued currency exchange rate” project in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
In particular, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a press release in this regard on the evening of 23 March, stating that China has a system of managed floating exchange rates based on market supply and demand, regulated by reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
The press release stressed that, overall, the RMB exchange rate was at a reasonably balanced level and was not underestimated.
Since 2005, the renminbi has accumulated an appreciation of more than 17 per cent against the United States dollar.
According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements, between the beginning of 2005 and May 2020, the effective renminbi exchange rate appreciated by 38 per cent and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49 per cent, the strongest currency among the G20 economies and one of the most appreciated currencies globally.
The Department of Commerce noted that the issue of exchange rates was beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
In February of this year, the United States amended its legislation to conduct countervailing investigations into foreign exchange rates, which are suspected of violating WTO rules and have been subject to multiple objections.
The press release stated that, even under United States regulations, the applicant's claims were subject to numerous errors and did not have the necessary countervailing elements, such as financial support, grant of benefits and earmarking.
China urges the United States to comply with existing international rules and to stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called “undervalued currency exchange rate”.
As a result of the rising tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and the 22-day exchange rate of the offshore renminbi against the United States dollar was at a time of great decline, with a double drop in the dollar against the 7.0 renminbi.
It is a matter of concern whether the United States Department of Commerce intends to promote the renminbi.
The renminbi went up to 7.0 on 23 days against the United States dollar and was collected at 6.9961.
The officially controlled median exchange rate of the renminbi against the United States dollar was reduced by 17 basis points on 24 days for 6.9938.
As the epidemic gradually improves, the film industry, which has been silent for almost six months, is returning to normal.
The day before, the 26th Shanghai Television Festival Committee had published a list of candidates for the Award.
In terms of the best female and male performers, the best performers of the elite have an absolute advantage: the best performers will compete for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best performers for the best.
The results will be officially announced on 7 August.
For the time being, from the point of view of the High Tests, a realistic educational drama entitled “China-style family” was presented as a “Small Joy”, with six nominations for “the best Chinese TV show”, “the best director”, “the best writer”, “the best actress”, and “the best male/female nickname”.
The “Best Man and Woman” award has always been one of the main concerns of the outside world, and this year's competition has been intense, with both male and female performers in the ranks of the elite.
Chen Po Guo, Huang and Sun Hong Lei are highly qualified middle-aged actors, as well as 37-year-old Le Chia-jin, and 32-year-old Zhang Joo-yung is the youngest entryist.
In 2016, 34-year-old Hu Songs won the best male actor in the White Jade Lantern Award on the Platoon, and this year Jang would refresh the record if he were able to win over the other seniors.
The struggle of the best female protagonists has also ended with a small wave of traffic among actors in the film industry such as Hai Qing, Mai Xing, Qin Haigu, Sun Xiao, and Yi Ni.
It is worth mentioning that Sun Xing entered the house on the basis of "At home", which was her sixth nomination for the award, and that in 2014 and 2016 she received "the best actress" on the basis of "Mother of the Year" and "Mother of the Moon" respectively.
On the morning of 25 July, at 0-2400 hours, Fujian Province reported the addition of one case of non-symptomatic infection outside the province, one case of confirmed diagnosis outside the country and four cases of non-symptomatic infection outside the country.
Of these, the new non-symptomatic infections outside the province were entered by Dalian City of Liaoning Province (Fouzhou City Report) and the new cases of confirmed diagnosis outside the country were entered by the Philippines (Siamen City Report); four new cases of non-symptomatic infections were added: one in the United States (Fuzhou City Report) and three in the Philippines (Siamen City Report).
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, Fujian Province had reported a cumulative flow of 69 confirmed cases outside the country, 66 cases have been cured and three are currently hospitalized and no deaths have been reported; there are currently zero reported cases outside the country; 13 reported cases of insymptomatic infections outside the country are still subject to centralized medical observation; 296 cases have been reported locally (295 cases have been cured, 0 are currently hospitalized, 1 is fatal); 0 cases have been reported locally; and 1 reported outside the province is still under centralized medical observation.
Close contacts have now released 14962 medical observers and 324 are still under medical observation.
The city of Rio announced the cancellation of the inter-annual celebrations - the new Chinese network.
The data show that, to date, Brazil has the second largest cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths globally, after the United States.
The State of São Paulo, where the epidemic is most severe, has accumulated nearly 480,000 confirmed cases and more than 20,000 deaths.
More than 160,000 cases were diagnosed in Ceará and 150,000 in Rio de Janeiro, and more than 140,000 in Pará and Bahia.
More than 110,000 cases were diagnosed in the states of Maranhão and Minas Gerais.

26, the day before the fifth State of the Nation address (SONA) by President Duarte of the Philippines, the cumulative number of new coronary pneumonia cases diagnosed in the Philippines increased to 80,000, with the PCOO and its immediate agencies increasing to 25 cases.
To this end, PCOO has prepared a working group that has not been contacted by the accredited staff to cooperate with President Duarte's press release of SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanal gave an interview with DZBB Radio on 26th, indicating that two packages of the SONA formula have been prepared for President Duarte.
According to Plan A, in the afternoon of 27 Durt will publish SONA in the building of the Congress of the Philippines (Batasang Pambansa) in Quezon City.
As a result of the epidemic, only 50 seats have been set aside for some members of the Government Cabinet and legislators, while video rooms have been set aside for other Cabinet members, local government officials, etc.
All participants will be able to enter the National Assembly building on the same day through rapid testing.
Once one of the participants tested positive, plan B was launched, whereby President Duarte published SONA at the Presidential Palace in Malakal, with fewer listening seats on the scene.
As is customary, SONA will be broadcast live throughout the country.
At the time of the submission, the Presidential Office of Fé had not confirmed whether the family of Dutelt would be present at SONA.
Andal said that President Duarte's SONA would focus on how the Government would lead the Philippines in responding to the new crown pneumonia epidemic and restoring socio-economic life; it would also mention his commitment to anti-government corruption, combating illegal drugs and reducing poverty when he took office.
Durt will also describe other plans of the current administration, including the creation of more jobs, the revitalization of the economy, the promotion of education, and assistance to overseas Filipino workers suffering from the epidemic.

Xinhua Society's Sino-Change electricity on 26 July (journalist Alfume) was affected by the epidemic, and Ningxia's city kindergarten has not yet been reopened, particularly with increased pressure on private kindergarten funding, which has had an impact on the stability and future sustainability of the kindergarten staff.
In response to this, the City of Sinakawa has supported the efforts to stabilize the teaching staff of non-inclusive private kindergartens through various measures such as the provision of subsidies for them, the provision of job stabilization subsidies for non-inclusive private kindergartens, and the reduction of rents for private kindergartens.
In accordance with the relevant policies of the City of Sinakawa, during the period of the epidemic, organisers of inclusive private kindergartens (including those that have been converted into inclusive after the administration of the municipal districts) pay teachers a monthly subsistence allowance of not less than $1.660 per person per month in accordance with the minimum wage of the three regions, and the municipal budget allocates a six-month subsidy to cover teachers'salaries and social insurance costs, in accordance with the average cost of 1,000 yuan per child per year per student.
In the case of non-inclusive private kindergartens, which are also allocated to the teaching staff for a minimum of US$ 1,660 per month per person, the City of Sinakawa will arrange a six-month subsidy to cover the maintenance allowance for early childhood teachers at the rate of US$ 500 per child per year.
At the same time, in the case of privately run kindergartens with State-owned assets, the City of Sinakawa will reduce the rent of three months of housing during the period of control of the epidemic and encourage other categories of tenants, such as developers, to assume social responsibility, the rent of kindergartens, and for more than three months, and the related tax fees will be exempted as a matter of policy.
The Yangtze River flood No. 3 of 2020 formed the Ministry of Water to refine the physical response - the China-New Network.
Xinhua Society in Beijing on 26 July (journalist Hu Xuan), flood No. 3 of the Yangtze River 2020.
During the 26th meeting, the Minister of Water requested that the three gorge reservoirs be carefully deployed, that the water from the upper Yangtze River and the Toyako Lake be taken into account in an integrated manner, that the miscalculation be carried out, that the reservoir be kept in place to prepare for possible major flooding and that the flood protection of the central and downstream dry currents and the important tolls of the Toyako lake be secured.
Heavy rains are forecast for the next three days in parts of the south-west, south-south-west, north-south-south-west and south-south-east of the river and central Guangxi, with heavy rains in parts of the north-south of the lake and south-west of the river; and in the west-west of the north-west of China, with heavy rains in parts of the north-south of the river.
The Ministry of Water predicts, as a result of its impact, that the flow of access to the three canals of the upper Yangtze may reach about 60,000 cubic metres per second around 28 days, and that the water level of the mid-dry-dry-flowing lotus and the Toyako lake will rise again and be overprotected by about 0.20 metres; that the dry-flowing water level in the rivers will generally slow down and that the waters of the Hundeh Lake will continue to rise; and that rivers such as the Great elixir system and the Everding River will undergo an upturning process.
Heiping suggested that the Huai River basin should further increase its discharge, reduce the level of Lake Hun Ze as soon as possible, and prepare for further major flooding.
There is a need to respond adequately to flood floods in the water system.
He said that there was a need for the T-Lake Basin to continue to increase its out-of-dwelling capacity, reduce the water levels of the T-Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible and reduce the risk of high water levels and typhoons in T-Lake.
In addition, he stressed that flooding in northern areas, such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei, had surged and fell, with short warning times and high vulnerability to landslides, which made it difficult to defend against them, and that there were a large number of small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams and security risks.
58 APPs against users have been exposed to more than a dozen listed companies - the Sino-New Network.
The Ministry of Industry and Communications informed that, in accordance with such laws and regulations as the Cybersecurity Act, the Telecommunications Regulations, the Regulations on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunication and Internet Users, and others, a third-party testing agency had recently been organized to inspect mobile phone applications and to supervise the restructuring of enterprises with problems.
The problems with these 58 APPs include private collection of personal information, over-extensive collection of personal information, frequent requests for privileges, over-requirement of privileges, difficulties with account write-offs, private sharing with third parties, denial of privileges, etc.
The Ministry of Information and Communications requested that the implementation of 58 APPs should be completed by 30 July and that, if they were overdue, the Ministry would organize the relevant disposals in accordance with the law.
New and medium-latitude journalists were combed and found that the 58 APPs behind the circulars involved more than a dozen United States, port and A-listed companies.
For example, “many houses” are products of companies listed in the United States stock market. There are five main issues of private collection of personal information, over-extensive collection of personal information, private sharing to third parties, compulsory use of targeted push functions by users, and frequent requests for privileges.
According to public sources, more houses than landed in NASDAQ in November 2019, “the first industrial Internet SaaS (software service) model in the country as a real estate intermediary”, offering online solutions to a large number of intermediaries.
In response to the “Where to” APP account write-off difficulties noted in the circular, the New Kyoto newspaper reported that where the network responded that to prevent black production from using frequent registrations and write-offs for profit, where registrations were made on an autonomous basis, and where write-offs required a one-month interval.
The combined consideration of write-off convenience and account security has been changed to immediate effect and is pending review.
An unnamed cyber-security expert has indicated to new and medium-latitude clients that APP circulars that violate user rights like this have been issued three times this year by the Ministry of Information and Communications.
Three of these issues, namely the private collection of personal information, over-requirement of authority, and difficulty in clearing accounts, have been “managing”.
It can also be observed from the circulars that there is an increasing focus on violations of privacy by APPs.
On 24 July, on the day of notification of 58 violations of user rights, the Ministry of Labour and Communications indicated that a circular had been issued on the date of the issuance of the circular, which had led to the deployment of a special anti-user awareness campaign.
Specialized corrections will strengthen monitoring and inspection in accordance with the rules, urge relevant enterprises to enhance the protection of APP personal information, improve the timely elimination of outstanding issues such as the collection of irregularities, the use of user personal information and harassment of users, the deception of users and the lack of implementation of management responsibilities for the application distribution platform, and clean up the APP application space.
Family Lewis: John Lewis is a soldier fighting for the weakest.
United States Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights fighter, was remembered as a fighter at a memorial service for him on Saturday, 25 July, as “the most vulnerable”.
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorials on the first day.
On Saturday, at an open memorial service at the University of Troy, Alabama, five brothers and sisters of Lewis and a grandson spoke of him as a loving, fearless and family-oriented man.
Henry “Grand” Lewis, the youngest brother of Lewis, said at the meeting, “He's dedicated his life to helping others.”
Samuel Lewis said that his mother had warned John “Don't get in trouble, don't get in trouble”.
He added that John had not listened to his mother's warning and said, “We all know that John always gets in trouble, always in trouble, but that's because he insists on the right thing, and that's good trouble.”
Lewis' brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial that John's most famous argument was to create “good trouble”, that is, not to shy away from provoking things for the sake of justice.
John applied for the University of Troy University, where he was born in the city of Troy, Alabama, but the University of Troy, which was all white schools at that time, refused his application for admission.
As a child, John Lewis, who preached the Gospel on his farm, was awarded a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy awarded Dr. Lewis an honorary degree.
Congressional Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters were “demonstrating peacefully and in a non-violent manner”, as Lewis had done in the civil rights movement.
According to Jones, “President Trump was wrong even when he knocked over a boat and described all the protesters as thugs.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal nation.”
A six-day series of events in honour of Lewis will culminate this week at the funeral in Georgia.
The casket of Lewis was parked on Saturday at a public memorial at the University of Troy, and people came to pay tribute to the leader of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, the remains of Lewis will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge of Selma.
In 1965, he and the black protesters demanding the right to vote were beaten up by the Alabama State police in front of the bridge, who also gave tear gas to the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed.
The day after that was called a bloody Sunday.
The remains of Lewis will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and finish this last journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require public participation in the event to wear masks and to maintain social distance.
The Governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey, ordered a half-flag to be lowered on Saturdays and Sundays in honour of Lewis.
During the almost week of commemoration, Lewis'remains will be separated from the Alabama State Council Building in Montgomery, the Georgia State Council Building in Atlanta, and the United States Congress Building in Washington, D.C., for public tributes.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate Majority Party, announced last week that people could come to the United States Congress Building on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
As a result of the coronary virus epidemic, the public event to pay tribute to Lewis will take place outside the house.
Shenzhen's public consultation on the introduction of health regulations - Xinhuanet
On 26 July, Shenzhen Xinhua (journalist Maussing, White Yo) encouraged residents to perform medical examinations on a regular basis and to detect problems at an early stage; prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; set up a health screening system for online games; and had to be staffed with part-time health managers... The Health Regulations of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (Consultation Draft) had been officially published, and the Shenzhen residents would have their own “health laws”.
In order to encourage residents to undergo medical examinations and to identify problems at an early stage, it was suggested that the health services should develop a basic catalogue of health check-ups based on age, occupation, etc.
The cost of a health check-up, which falls within the basic catalogue of health-care projects, is covered by the Integrated Fund for Social Health Insurance at the rate of one per person per year.
It is clear from the comments that the employer should make a reasonable allocation of human resources, make staff time available, introduce a rotation system for workers with higher mental and physical workloads, avoid excessive loss of human capacity or physical or mental health damage to the health of the employee, and enforce the system of paid leave for employees.
In addition, employers are required to have dedicated part-time health managers and to organize regular staff health check-ups.
With regard to the physical and mental health of minors, the consultation draft proposed that the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors should be prohibited and that the location of the sale of alcoholic beverages should be restricted. In the event of a violation of the regulations, a fine of 30,000 yuan would be imposed on the management of the market.
In addition to the Prohibition of Liquor, minors also have to be “multi-opportunity”.
According to the consultation draft, schools are required to arrange for physical activity for more than one hour per day.
In the case of cyber games, the public security, cultural wide-television sports, network supervision and health departments should improve the system of health supervision of Internet Internet service establishments and establish a system of health screening for online games in order to create a good space for interaction and a culture of interaction in order to promote the healthy development of young people.
In addition, the consultation notes that patients with influenza are required to wear masks to access public places and that health-care institutions are fined $20,000, etc. for leaking patients'privacy without consent.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical and mental health of the population, the consultation draft also requires the Shenzhen sector to assess the impact of the implementation of public policies on the health of the population prior to the preparation of plans relating to urban spatial planning and construction, industrial park planning and construction, resource exploitation and environmental protection, the development of the biomedical industry, normative documents and the approval of major construction projects and the implementation of major public service projects.
It may not be enacted or approved for implementation without an assessment or assessment that would have a more serious adverse effect on urban public health or the health of the population.

In recent days, the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping, during his visit to Jilin province, stressed the need to strengthen party leadership, promote the extension of party organization to the lowest levels, improve the system of grass-roots party organization and provide strong guarantees of governance in urban and rural communities.
The insistence on party-led leadership and the integration of party leadership into all spheres of grass-roots governance is a fundamental requirement for good governance at the grass-roots level.
To raise the level of governance at the grass-roots level and to insist on party leadership, to promote the party's political, organizational and mass work advantages into governance by strengthening political leadership, building forts and rallying red forces, and to transmit the party's strength and ideas to the “last kilometre of the nerve”.
Focus on the calcium cast and strengthen political leadership.
Political leadership to strengthen governance at the grass-roots level will require the implementation of the calcium fixation project.
It is important to learn from the socialist ideas of Chinese identity in the new era of Xi Jinping as a matter of priority, to make the theme “Don't forget your mind, remember your mission” the permanent theme of the party's construction and the lifelong theme of the party's members and cadres, to strengthen the principle of reading the original books, and to promote the party's innovative theory through thematic training, block training, discussion and exchange, and the organization of lecture halls and so on, and to further strengthen the “four consciousnesss”, the “four self-confidences” and the “two preservations” of the party's cadres and better discharge of their responsibilities.
Through a combination of online and offline learning, learning channels have been expanded to guide grass-roots party organizations and party cadres to genuinely integrate learning into everyday and regular practice.
Focusing on practical exercise, in addressing the difficult issues at the grass-roots level in the area of governance, the concerns of the population are resolved, the concerns of the population are resolved and the party's nature and capacity are reduced.
Get the rules up and build the fort of battle.
Grass-roots party organizations are both an important part of the system of governance at the grass-roots level and an important vehicle of governance capacity.
To promote the normative development of grass-roots party organizations, starting with the rules governing the operation of the party's branches, focusing on issues such as the weakening of party leadership, the collapse of the party's leadership, the creation of mechanisms for networking, the creation of branches of innovation, the normalization of weaknesses, the establishment of sound decision-making mechanisms, the provision of services to the population, etc., and the promotion of development.
In rural areas, efforts have been made to strengthen the standardization of the organization of village parties, to standardize the construction standards of their branches, to regulate the form of their organization, their learning activities and their management mechanisms, and to ensure that the system of “three sessions” and the theme party day activities are implemented.
In cities, focusing on street communities, exploring the form of innovative branches, focusing on weak areas, “blocks” and “pain spots”, actively building a coalition of city parties to achieve effective coverage of the party's work.
At the same time, the institutional mechanisms for governance at the grass-roots level have been put in place; they have been set up to deal with matters of common interest, work together, work together on important issues, work together on urgent matters, work together on difficult issues, and decision-making mechanisms led by grass-roots party organizations; they have improved the mechanisms for connecting party cadres to serve the masses; they have brought together people in the service of the people; and they have increased the sense of access, happiness, honour and pride of the members of the party in order to make governance at the grass-roots level more warmer.
Play the vanguard, rally the red force.
Basic party cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
Strengthening grass-roots governance, focusing on the governance of grass-roots party cadres, and on the role of the “red cell” as a model leader in grass-roots governance, bringing red forces together at the forefront of reaching out to the public.
To promote governance as a mandatory subject for members of the party at the grass-roots level, and to continue to strengthen their intellectual skills, professional training and practical training, and to develop their spirit of responsibility in their positions of responsibility and in their urgent and demanding tasks, they will contribute to building the foundations for the modernization of the State's governance system and its capacity to govern.
The campaign “Community whistle-blowing, Party membership reporting” involves participation in community building, management and services by participating in thematic party days, reaching out to people in need, defining service lines, recognizing modest intentions and making sound recommendations, and allowing members to play a role in community governance.
The full exercise of the role of non-members in rural areas should lead to the active participation of members of grass-roots parties in the fight against poverty, in the construction of ecology, in the maintenance of correspondence and in the suppression of burning, and to the better integration of the red force in the service of the population, including through the creation of a pioneer post for non-member members and the formation of a task force for non-member members of the party.
Ground-based solidity building.
The grass-roots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by maintaining a strong focus on party cohesion and enhancing the well-being of the people and using party leadership as a fundamental means of promoting innovative development in governance at the grass-roots level can it be established that grass-roots party organizations can be pulled out and able to take up, that grass-roots party cadres can get up and run, and that grass-roots governance can be “spirited”, orderly, robust and effective.

Coco Sicily's antelope is back in season - Xinhuanet.
On 25 July, Xinning Xining Xining, Xinhua, a journalist (Jinjin Wang, journalist) learned from the five-way beam protection station of the Coco Sili administration of the Yangtze National Parks Administration in the Yangtzeen Park District, that monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelope who had previously travelled to the Lake Drone region in the heart of Coco Sicily was ending their labour and began to return to their homes with young children.
Surveillance of the five beams near the protection station showed that on 25 July, about 40 female herds, led by three herds, continued to move back through the 3002 km of the Blue Hide Road and the five Liangbei Bridge on the Blue Hide Railway.
The experts analysed that, in recent years, the number of hide-and-go-go-go-go-go-go-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
The Deputy Researcher at the North-West Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences stated: “In the early stages of the relocation, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of being arrested, so that the number of cubs in the flock is relatively small and may even be absent.”
According to the Coco Siri Administration of the Yangtze National Parks Administration, the number of re-locations of Tibetan antelopes has generally increased year by year, from 4860 in 2019 to 338 in 2018.
Even the new statement: “It is expected that this year's return will be completed at the beginning of September, and the number of returns is expected to continue to increase”.
Tibetan antelopes are protected at the national level.
At the end of May of each year, Tibetan antelopes from the Qinghai trijiangsu, Tibet Pond and Xinjiang Alkin are going to produce lambs in Lake Trene, located in the heart of Coco Sicily.
Our Tibetan antelope protection expert, Wu Xiaomin, a researcher at the Institute of Animals of the Province of Shaanxi (North-West Institute of Endangered Animals), said: “The return of Tibetan antelopes is the process of returning to their habitat with young children after the completion of the female herd. The first group of returns from the land of origin is larger, but then the herds will return to their respective habitat according to different geographical populations and along different routes.”
In order to ensure the safe return of the Tibetan antelope herds, journalists were informed that the former Changjiri administration of the Yangjiang Parks Administration had arranged for staff to conduct continuous video monitoring and district patrols in the main areas of the relocation.
In the event that a hidden herd is found attempting to cross the road, the rangers will exercise temporary traffic control for the first time, allowing the herd to pass safely through wildlife routes and ensuring that it will be subjected to as little human interference as possible on its return journey.
So, what do we do in everyday life?
The experts suggested that summer days should avoid high-temperature periods and that it would be better not to walk or work in the hot sun before or after noon, as the sun is the strongest and the heat is more likely to occur.
If it is necessary to go out during this period, protection must be done, such as setting up an umbrella, wearing a hat, wearing sunglasses, with conditions that are best used to wear sunscreens to prevent sunburn.
Clothes are selected to the extent possible using light-coloured, gas-friendly cotton, as well as filamentary, and less penetrating fibre-based clothing, in order to avoid excessive sweating without the timely evaporation of the heat, which causes heat to catch heat.
In hot and hot weather, sufficient water should be prepared, used in good time, and water should not be used until it is thirsty, since once the thirst indicates that the body is already water-scarce, the drinking of water is controlled at 150 to 200 ml per drink, the drinking of warm and open water and the drinking of ice water.
Based on the high and low temperatures, average staff drink 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, and high-temperature operators drink 3 to 5 litres per day.
When sweating is greater, some salt water can be properly replenished to compensate for loss of salt due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to a shortage of potassium during the summer, which is an excellent source of drinking water.
Water-rich vegetables such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, and fresh fruits such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc. can be used to supplement water by 80 to 90 per cent; dairy products can both replenish water and meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, drinking products containing potassium, magnesium, etc. should be appropriately supplemented for people working in high-temperature environments.
It is easy to be tired when summer is short, when temperatures are high and when humans are highly metabolic and consuming.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and the entire body system, both for work and learning and as a preventive measure against heat and heat.
According to the experts, the best time to go to bed was between 2200 and 2300 hours, and the best time to get up was between 5.30 and 6.30 p.m.
While sleeping, be careful not to lie under air conditioning vents and electric fans in order to develop air conditioners and hot wind.
Experts suggest that people who operate outdoors or perform high-temperature operations may carry with them 10 drops of anti-smoking drugs, such as water, humans, saline or saline or saline gas pills, or place them in close proximity to the workplace and use them at any time in order to prevent heat from occurring.
Graduate art exhibition to market public goods exhibition - Xinhuanet
During the “Yun graduation” season in universities, a rare underline graduate art exhibition was inaugurated on the weekends.
However, it was not in the galleries, nor in the campus, but in the public space of the city of Yoo-yang and was open to the public free of charge until 23 August.
Journalists learned that the 2020 Graduate Art Fair gathered 50 pieces/groups of work from 57 young artists from the Central School of Fine Arts, the Chinese Media University and the Tianjin School of Fine Arts. The exhibition space was extended from 2nd to 6th floor, making full use of the building's light box for the presentation of flat works, to maximize the artistic atmosphere during the graduation season.
This exhibition is particularly relevant in the context of the epidemic.
“We have chosen to bring back below-line space to the graduation show, which will lead to the `Cloud Ends', and we want more people to see young people understand their own explorations and the world, and to magnify the healing power of art for society and the mind.”
She revealed that the exhibit had been collected from graduates of several artistic institutions, from which it had been chosen for commercial displays in the form of paintings and sculptures on traditional racks, to new media devices, interactive drawings, VR panoramas, the highest volume and abundance in the years.
Among them, Li Yunshaw expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a combination of mechanical and manual creative language in the first battle of 2020; Liu Ka-young explored the themes of “encrypted currency”, “credit creation” and “trade”; Zhang's Catwood and Qiu Da-jeong were expressions of animals often associated with human beings, from which the young artist's understanding of human-animal relations can be seen; and Liu's work, “The Winter of Faith - A Gift”, was a reminder to growing young people that “when one day's career comes true, remember the simple and sincere part of it.”
Of the small number of graduates who have made their own displays, there are Lee Ying-chung from the sculpture department of the Tianjin School of Fine Arts.
“I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was a little worried about the epidemic, and I did a nucleic acid test three days in advance, with alcohol cotton and test reports.”
His work, Yesterday's The Enigma, was more complex in structure and had to be personal.
At the same time, he has the task of helping his fellow students to repair damaged works.
"The show goes to 4:30 a.m. and then it's patched up. It's tight. I forgot to take a picture of the work, and I'm sorry."
He hoped that when the epidemic stabilized, he would come to Beijing with his classmates to see his work show.

According to the CBA league official, the CBA Qingjia area is finally home to the first fans to come back to the game today.
On-site fans included mobile workers from Qingdao, as well as doctors, teachers, public security personnel and others who made outstanding contributions to society during the epidemic. On 31 July, after the CBA season, there will be a formal resumption of voting for Qingdao fans.
As a result of the epidemic, the CBA tournament resumed on 20 June, almost five months after its interruption.
Although there was a small audience for the 26th afternoon, the feeling on the scene was already clear: there was applause and there was silence.
It has been a long time since images of field players fighting against needles and lower-end fans fighting in the chambers.
At the end of the season, if fans want to watch the game live, this is what we're looking for.
This open-end fans buy tickets at the Qingjima Sports Centre Diamond Stadium (Sunsan District), where tickets are sold in full by means of a system of on-line and off-line ticketing, and all fans must be 12 years of age and have a nucleic acid test within 48 hours.
Incented by $50,000, Hubei Eun-hyun's "Alarm First" on the slopes of the sand dam - the China-New Network.
On 26 July, the Hubei daily newspaper (journalist Lin Jing), Enshi City informed Chen Xiang Xiang, a geohazard site monitor who had made an important contribution to the early warning of the sand dam landslide, and sent him a $50,000 bonus.
At the same time, members of the entire municipal party are called upon to learn from his dedication, commitment, initiative and dedication.
On 21 July, a landslide in the sand dam in the village of Tumburg, Nsh city, led to the formation of a lake in the main stream of the Qingjiang River, of 58-year-old Chen Xian, who was the first to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of 17 July, Chen Xiang was informed of the breaking of the walls of the villagers'homes and immediately visited the site.
Just five or six hundred metres out of his home, he saw a group of village roads split by four or five centimetres, stretching down the road to the cornfield, about 50 metres in length.
Chen Guangjing was alert to sending photographs of the opening of the road to the “Geological Disaster Monitor Contact Group” in the countryside.
Following on-site inspection and judgement by the relevant officials of the Tumburg Township Natural Planning Institute, the possibility of a landslide was high and a decision was taken to evacuate the crowd.
Chen Xiang's timely warning resulted in 36 hours of valuable time for the safe evacuation of 1,339 people in 315 families in the affected area.
No one was killed or injured in this major geological disaster.
Chen Xiang's responsible and responsible professionalism was praised by the public.
Faced with praise, he said, "There's no one to save, it's my responsibility."
The University of Australasia is developing a new drug that is expected to be used for the treatment of new crown-induced vascular congestion - the Xinhua Net.
Researchers at the University of Mornash, Australia, with Xinhua Society Sydney Electric of 26 July (journalist Chen Woo) are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and it is hoped that it will be used to treat vascular congestion caused by the new coronary virus.
Researchers found that one of the enzymes in the blood plate accelerates blood plate condensation before a heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they have developed a drug that temporarily inhibits plaque condensation and thus avoids vascular congestion and acts as a precaution against heart disease and stroke.
According to researchers, the drug only inhibits the condensation effects of platelets in the event of a heart attack or a stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular congestion is one of the leading causes of death among new coronary patients, researchers hope that the drug will be used in the future for the treatment of such patients.
At present, the drug has had good results in animal modelling experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The results of the research have been published in the United States magazine Science Conversion Medicine.
He became the first audience to come after the CBA tournament resumed to allow the audience to watch the game live.
On that day, during the second round of the Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) resumed in Qingdong Island, Shandong, from 2019 to 2020, medical personnel, teachers and public security front personnel passed through the official ticket purchase platform to complete the related process, including nucleic acid testing, and came to watch the Shanghai Jianjin team's battle against the Mount East and West Kings.
During the competition, the participants are required to wear masks for the entire duration of the race and to take seats at a strict distance of one metre.
When leaving, the audience is required to maintain an orderly exit from the social distance of “one metre” in the order between the two sides and the rear.

Xinjiang Harmi 26th of July, Chinese News Agency: Deep Farming to Sunseta with Clean Energy
More than 6000 pentagonal sunglasses, 48 square metres each, rounded and neatly organized, like a silver “Sunflower” that moves with the sun and reflects the sun to the hub's heat-spill towers, which are more than 200 metres high, generating electricity.
This scene was seen by journalists at the Harmi Molotov cocktail-type light-thropic power plant in the town of Lake Frou, Igu, Xinjiang city.
“The so-called molten salt tower luminous power generation is the reflection of solar light through mirrors to create thermal energy in the soaking towers and the conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy through traditional power generation techniques.”
Zhang Yong, Deputy General Manager, China-Home Solar Thermoelectric Power Company Ltd., described the design principles as similar to those used in rural solar stoves in the north-west of China and the need to gather solar light.
Construction began in October 2017 and the site was connected at the end of last year, accounting for 6,600 acres, with a total planned installation of 14,500 sunglasses.
“The greatest advantage of the traditional solar power generation technology is that the concentrated thermal energy can be stored and generated at night.”
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour thermal storage system deployed by the project would allow the generator team to operate in a steady and continuous manner, free from light changes; it could also participate rapidly in the power grid switching in accordance with the needs of the grid load valley.
When fully completed, the project will achieve an annual power generation of 198 million degrees, save more than 60,000 tons of coal per year, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a source of clean energy for the local population.
In addition to this, there is another silver “Sunshine Sunflower” in the Shizuku Industrial Park in the city of Hammi.
The Hamifor Photovoltaic Solar Power Station occupies more than 2,300 acres of land, and the 714 installed power plants follow the sun in the same way, maintaining the 90-degree straight angle of the solar light and the concentrated panels.
“We use two-axis tracking concentrated light power generation technology, and through integrated integrated control, all power generation equipment will maintain its efficiency by adjusting its angle to the Sun's altitude.”
Mnuki, the station's chief, said that, in light weather conditions, the power generation technology could increase by about 20 per cent in comparison with traditional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of the year, the station has achieved more than 7 million degrees of electricity generation, complementing local electricity demand.
Ishigami Photovoltaic Industrial Park is the largest single site in Xinjiang today and the most complete type of photovoltaic component is a demonstration park in the photovoltaic industry, with 38 projects on photovoltaic power with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kW.
In the first half of the year, more than 110 million degrees of electricity generation were completed, an increase of 6 per cent over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of China's best-served regions with solar energy resources.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megacalories per square metre, accounting for around 3,200 hours per day throughout the year.
In recent years, the city has made significant efforts to develop a photovoltaic industry with a view to growing “Sunsun-Aunata”.
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power generation have been built and the city's photovoltaic capacity exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of this year, an increase of about 14 per cent in the same year.
At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 photovoltaic power stations with a installed capacity of more than 10 million kW.
Photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees throughout the year, replacing more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
The police report details of the “disconnection of female college students to the Qinghai Sea” and the search and rescue work is continuing - Xinhuanet.
Xinning, Xinning, Xinhua Society, has recently lost contact with “a female university student on a trip to Qinghai Gaewood” following a call for electricity from Xinning on 26 July.
On 26 June, the Public Security Bureau of the city of Germu, Hei-Mong ethnic Tibetan Autonomous Oblast, Qinghai Province, reported that one of the students at a university in Nanjing is still in a state of disassociation and that many of the police are actively engaged in search work along the border of a lost land.
On 10 July 2020, the security unit of the Ghorgi City Public Security Department in Heisy County was informed by its superiors that a student at a university in Nanjing, who was travelling from Nanjing to Ghorgi in a Z164 train on 5 July, had lost hand-held equipment in the south-west river area of the Sonam Daje Protection Station in the Tamaleh Autonomous State of Tamaki, Qinghai Province, and requested assistance in the search.
According to the investigation conducted by the public security bureau of the city of Ghorgi, Huang Xiaoqiao entered the territory of Qinghai province at 1954 hours on 6 July and arrived in the city of Ghormu at 0400 hours on 7 July.
At 0800 hours on the same day, the missing person, a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in the city of Ghorgi, headed towards G109, arrived at 1200 hours at the Coco-Sorisonandaje protection station, and the taxi driver returned alone. At 1500 hours on one of the seven days, the taxi driver arrived at the riverine area near the Sonandaje protection station until 1800 hours on 9 September.
In a further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed through the Nagui Gou checkpoint at 1707 hours on 13 July.
In view of the lack of video surveillance at the Naquita checkpoint in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, which was set up at the south entrance of the city of Ghormu, where it was impossible to establish information on the person and the vehicle on which he was travelling, the police were able to search by car and coordinate with the public security bureau of the city of Ghormu in the event that one of the checkpoints along the Tibetan route was found.
According to the latest information, at 1 a.m. on 26 July, the Public Security Bureau of the city of Ghorgi organized rescue forces to carry out search operations at the protection station of the unfrozen springs along the Qingzhou highway and at the Sonam Daje protection station, and actively contacted the Sichuan police, the Tibetan police and the Nanjing police to work together, and search and rescue efforts are continuing.
The local police are hoping that relevant leads from a wide range of online and social sources will be made available to the Gergim police and the Nanjing Jiangning police in a timely manner, with a view to early identification of the missing persons.
At the same time, experts have advised tourists to regulate, rational and civilized their outdoor activities, to keep an eye on roadside warning signs, not to risk entering an unmanned area, to be in a state of emergency and to report incidents to the police in a timely manner.
U.S. media revealed the truth about the unprovoked demand by the U.S. to shut down China's Consulate General in Houston.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Imaging Network
The US media revealed the fact that the U.S. demands China to shut down its Consulate General in Houston without justification.
On 24 November, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its permit for the establishment and operation of the Consulate General of the United States in Chengdu and had made a specific request to the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities as a countermeasure to the sudden request by the United States to close the Consulate General in Houston on 21 December.
This act of the United States Government has attracted many attention and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why do you ask China to close the Consulate General?
According to many foreign agents, it was not clear why the United States would choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media said so openly: for the sake of the general elections.
Cable News Network (CNN) reported on 23 that the United States demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston had raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the catastrophic response of the United States Government to the new crown epidemic has led to a low rate of popular support for President Trump prior to the elections.
White House officials privately claimed that the hard-line strategy with China was to save Trump’s support, but also to shift responsibility for failing the White House epidemic.
The article argues that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a “politically driven and very cautious” target chosen by the United States Government “to create a strong attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict”.
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) agreed that when the United States election season came and the United States economy was severely hit by the epidemic, Trump considered that “the playing of the “China card” had a political advantage”.
The current situation is “a spiral-up, inverse struggle”, driven in part by domestic considerations by the United States Administration, which only exacerbates tensions between China and the United States.
The United States Broadcasting Corporation of Colombia (CBS) reported that Trump's prospects for re-election had been strained by the outbreak and that he had repeatedly accused China of the epidemic.
There are almost daily new actions in the United States against Trump's absurd claim that “China exploits the United States”.
“The Houston Consulate General is of great importance in establishing ties between the two countries”.
The Associated Press commented that the United States demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston had exacerbated tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
In the event of the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the south of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do United States citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston deplored the request of the United States to China to close its Consulate General in Houston, stating that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
The American Foreign Policy magazine website considers that this move by the United States “is part of a series of provocative initiatives that only worsen relations between the United States and China”.
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia from the Brookings Institution of the United States think tank, as saying that, since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he had no idea what could be compared to the United States operation against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
The Hong Kong South China Morning Post reported that this move by the United States was unprecedented in the diplomatic relations between China and the United States for more than 40 years.
According to analysts, such a move could result in lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 as the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China maintains an embassy and five consulates-general in the United States.
Russia holds a military parade to celebrate the Naval Festival - Xinhuanet
On 26 July, in St. Petersburg, Russia, a fleet of ships took part in the naval festival celebrations.

The Xinhua Society celebrated the 324th anniversary of the establishment of the Russian Navy on 26 July in Moscow on the occasion of a military parade by Russian fleets (journalist Rukindbo).
On that day, the Russian fleets of the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Pacific Ocean held military parades in the waters of their respective bases, in which a total of 15,000 troops, 219 ships of all types and 71 military aircraft participated.
Russian President Putin, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, attended the parade of the Baltic Fleet.
Some 4,000 military personnel, 46 vessels and more than 40 warplanes took part in the local parade.
Putin first inspected the flotilla in the waters of the naval base in Kalangstad in the Baltic Sea.
He then arrived in the waters of the River Nieva in the centre of the city of St. Petersburg in a speedboat and went ashore, watching the parade on the River Nieva.
In his speech at the parade, Putin said that the modern technology of Russian naval equipment had continued to rise in recent years and that the Russian Navy would receive a total of about 40 new ships with unique high-sonic strike systems in 2020.
In addition, the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, Yevmenov, in a recent interview with the newspaper Red Star, an agency of the Russian Ministry of Defence, stated that Russia's plans to build ships had been effectively implemented and that the number of new ships planned for 2020 had been larger in recent years.
In 1696, the tsar Peter the Great began to form a maritime fleet, beginning with the history of the Russian Navy.
The last Sunday in July of each year is the Russian Naval Festival.
In response to new developments in the prevention and control of the epidemic, since 17 July Xinjiang trade unions at all levels have been actively involved in the prevention and control of the epidemic, in response to the call of the General Union of the Autonomous Communities.
The Tianshan-North trade union cadres, workers, labour models, etc. have entered the street community and among the population. They carry out activities such as feeding, disinfecting and disseminating information about the disease, serving the workers and highlighting the union's “hard nuclear forces” with practical actions.
In recent days, the Tianshan General Trade Union of Urumqi city, in a condolence group, delivered much-needed disease prevention and control supplies to staff in 12 isolation points.
In the wake of the epidemic, over 1.05 million yuan was spent for the first time in the Tianshan region and, as a matter of urgency, 23 direct trade unions were allocated.
The Deputy Secretary of the Xinjiang Construction Workers I Party and the President of the trade union, Zhao Sang-guk, after being notified of the company's prevention and control of the epidemic, offered to remain on duty in order to protect the workers.
He delivers cookers, food and daily items for workers living in the unit dormitories and new recruits, and arranges for them to be provided with essential supplies every two days.
“As of 21 July, a survey was carried out of the cadres on the front line of the war `epidemic' and, by means of an off-the-shelf and a commercial delivery, the 704 first-line workers in the Urumqi region were supplemented with sanitary supplies and living materials.”
The Xinjiang trade union officials told journalists that in the face of the outbreak, they were fully committed to ensuring the security of services for the prevention and control of the epidemic, steadily promoting transport development and creating a strong climate for the fight against the pandemic.
At a time of high summer temperatures, trade unions at all levels are focusing on front-line workers in priority areas for prevention and control of the epidemic, giving practical attention to “cooking out” care.
On 19 July, the General Union of Urumqi Districts launched a condolence mission to “secute” frontline workers in order to combat the epidemic, and condolence items, such as beverages and fruit, were received at police stations, checkpoints and health systems throughout the county.
“Commonwealth officials need to further strengthen their political positions and their responsibilities, to care for the warmth of the people and to inspire action.
The role of trade union organizations in uniting and uniting workers, ensuring the protection of services for the prevention and control of the epidemic, actively defending the health rights and interests of workers in general, and bringing care to front-line workers is to be fully realized.”
The head of the General Trade Union of the Autonomous Communities stated that:
Direct recruitment of cadets was fully launched in 2020 - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Society, in Beijing on 26 July, the Ministry of Political Work and the Ministry of Defence Mobilization of the Xinhua Military Committee (JaQianglong, journalist) issued a joint circular in recent days on the deployment of a direct recruitment of cadets from general higher education graduates by 2020.
This year, the direct recruitment of cadets covers more than 270 general military specializations in 64 categories, such as computers, automation, mechanics, etc., with a focus on increasing the number of recruits for such professions as drones, navigation, aerospace, electronics, small languages, etc., with an increase of nearly 2,000 over the previous year.
This year, the direct recruitment of cadets was organized in parallel with the recruitment of conscripts, which began on 1 August and ended on 30 September.
Young conscripts can consult the National Recruitment Network (http://www.gfbzb.gov.cn) for the direct recruitment of cadets and the distribution of recruits by region, submit online registration information that meets the professional scope and recruitment requirements, and participate in follow-up recruitments such as medical examinations, political examinations, etc., in accordance with the uniform requirements of the military service authorities of the place of recruitment.
Qualified young people who are unable to enrol as non-commissioned officers due to professional and programmatic restrictions may participate in the recruitment of compulsory soldiers, and the number of years of study in the regular higher education system shall be equal to the length of service when they are selected as non-commissioned officers at the end of compulsory military service.
This year, the recruitment of cadets is organized jointly by the Provincial or Municipal People's Government Recruitment Offices, with the potential to enrol in specialties selected on the basis of a comprehensive assessment of the level of education to be enrolled, the performance of professional courses during school years, the acquisition of professional qualifications, etc. The scarce professions will be targeted at local institutions that meet professional requirements and have the advantage of admission.
In accordance with the normal epidemiological control requirements, direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers this year does not, in principle, arrange for self-registering and will be organized for transport to camps in parallel with conscripts.
The direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers began on 1 September 2020, and the Force issued an order for the service of non-commissioned officers on 1 December 2020.
The receiving units of the Force will develop scientific recruitment and professional training programmes and carefully organize their training; upon completion of the training, cadets will be assigned to their counterparts in technical and technical skills on a uniform basis, in accordance with the principle of professional counterpart and consistency in recruitment.
Speaker at the British Embassy: The Chinese Government is a firm defender of cyber security - China New Network
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on 25 July, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom asked journalists about false statements about cyber attacks.
The Chinese Government, as a firm defender of cybersecurity, had always firmly opposed and combated cyberattacks and cybercrime in any form.
Questions were posed by journalists: according to the media, hacker groups associated with China had interfered with a British network of companies, launched attacks on British-American technology companies with proprietary data, and invaded the European Union national government network.
The Chinese Government, as a firm defender of cybersecurity, had always firmly opposed and combated cyberattacks and cybercrime in any form.
The virtual nature of cyberspace, the difficulties of traceability and the diversity of actors should be supported by sufficient evidence and unprovoked speculation when investigating and characterizing cyber-events.
The past series of events, such as the prism door, had proved that the United States had been conducting the largest cyber-tapping operation in the world.
It is in the common interest of all States to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
China's achievements in science, technology and innovation had not been stolen, but had been achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted some 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a major country of innovation and intellectual property rights.
According to data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China, in the first half of the year, new loans from Xinjiang-based farmers and micro-enterprises were increased by more than the full year of 2019.
During the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking sector in increasing lending and providing adequate financial guarantees for the prevention and rehabilitation of the epidemic.
Most of Urumqi's free nucleic acid tests are almost complete.
In a briefing on the latest outbreak and nucleic acid testing in the city of Urumqi, Zhang Wei, Director of the Urumqi City Health Commission of the Central and New Network Urumqi (journalist Sun Tinwen Zhao Yamin), on 26 July, said that most of the free nucleic acid testing in the city of Urumqi was now almost complete.
The development of the epidemic is being further assessed by a team of State Council experts and experts from the autonomous regions and the municipality of Urumqi on the basis of the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiology surveys.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region held a press conference to inform about the Xinjiang epidemic and its prevention and control.
According to him, between 000 and 2400 hours on 25 July, 22 new cases of coronary pneumonia and 38 new cases of non-symptomatic infections were diagnosed in the city of Urumqi.
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, there were 135 confirmed cases in the city of Urumqi and 147 cases of unsymptomatic infections.
The 25-day increase in the number of non-symptomatic infections was also largely screened through free nucleic acid testing throughout the city.
On 26 June, Zhang Wei, Director of the Urumqi City Health Commission, stated that most of the free nucleic acid testing in the city of Urumqi had been largely completed.
He added that, from experience in other parts of the country, there were a number of factors affecting the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the test agent, the time of infection and discharge of the person being tested, the cooperation of the person being tested at the time the sample was taken, which could result in the specimen being unattended, and the environment of testing, the operational proficiency of the tester.
Tests for nucleic acid also have false negative results for a variety of reasons.
The so-called pseudo-negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, it usually takes two nucleic acid tests to exclude persons who have been in close contact with diagnosed and suspected cases.
For those who have travelled to high-risk areas of the epidemic, it is possible that a negative nucleic acid test may exist in the event of fever and respiratory symptoms, and therefore two nucleic acid tests are required to exclude it.
In view of the above, he states that, for the sake of the health of the entire city's population, the city of Urumqi will, from today's date, conduct a second free test of nucleic acid in priority areas such as Tianshan and Shaibak district, together with a “recovery” exercise.
The Tianshan and Shaibak districts are known to be high-risk areas.
We've got a lot of industrial confidence coming out of the Shanghai International Film Festival.
2020-07-26 06:52:39 Source: Reporter.
There's a lot of “on the cloud” under the line, and there's a lot of industrial confidence coming out of the Shanghai International Film Festival.
Yesterday, the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival 2020, organized in the context of strict quarantine measures, inaugurated the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival with the launch of an industry summit forum entitled “Towards a New Era of Dreams”.
This year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance as the first international film festival since the continued spread of the global epidemic and the normalization of our epidemic prevention and control.
The Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is a sign of confidence and, above all, a sign of determination – that we remain confident in fighting the epidemic, that we will hold people’s festivals, and that we will not lose faith in building a global centre for film creation, and that we will ring the “Shanghai culture” brand.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with its innovative and progressive posture, is a fresh start and a fresh start.
Therefore, every step needs to be taken to serve the spiritual well-being of the population and the high-quality development of the visual industry.
This year more than ever.
In order to value the hard-won epidemic prevention and control situation, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, has strictly adhered to the requirements of the disease prevention and control measures, and, on the other hand, has set in motion multi-sectional activities under the line with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the needs of the fans.
On the first day of the opening, from under-line viewing to industry forums, film festival-related activities strictly implement the relevant vaccination policy.
The activities of the Forum are controlled by up to 50 persons, with each sighting being isolated and with a tight seating rate of up to 30 per cent.
As the Film Festival Committee holds, it is in any case a major premise that “the safety and physical well-being of the population should be placed first”.
Underline activity has been significantly streamlined and “on the cloud” has become quite popular.
This year's Shanghai International Film Festival is an occasion for innovation and transformation to meet the diverse needs of fans by means of initiatives such as the “Cloud Show” on the line and the “Cloud Sharing” of the master class, in order to implement the important concept of “People's Cities: People's Cities for People”.
On the first day of the opening, the film festival's official partners, Mt. Mt. Mt. Mt.
That evening, the King’s inaugural forum and Master Jashenko’s class were also online on various platforms, such as video, study of the powerful, and Wenweife App, to keep the latest developments in Chinese films out of the house.
At yesterday's inaugural forum, the film festival was opened with a message from Xiaoming, a member of the Central Radio and Television Party and deputy director of the station, and a message from Hye Lin Zhou, the Standing Committee of the Shanghai City Council and Minister of Communications, in the presence of the Deputy Mayor, Zong Ming.
White House epidemiologist Foggy: cautiously optimistic about the vaccine being developed in early 2021.
Fuch 25 made the above statement at a web-based videoconference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation.
He cautioned that it was not yet clear how the new crown epidemic would develop in autumn and winter or what its ultimate impact would be, “and that the only way to end it is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution”.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, the number of newly diagnosed cases in the United States had reached 4,176,000 and 146,000 deaths as at 2100 hours on 25 February.
Foggy said that some parts of the United States were currently struggling to combat the rebounding epidemic.
Although the epidemic varies from one region to another and requires tailored responses, a diversified response does not mean that there is no close link between regions.
The epidemic in one region will eventually affect other regions.
“This is no time for complacency”, Foggy said, “Our work has not been completed, we must intensify our efforts and we must be vigilant about the uncertainty of the future”.
The United States Chinese medical expert and founder of the “Littletail Therapy” for AIDS pointed out at the conference that the new United States crown epidemic has not yet reached its peak.
“Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus.”
What is the big call for the public to use its own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the development of new canopy treatment drugs and vaccines?
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization aimed at promoting international exchanges between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region, working to promote Asia-Pacific communities in the United States and to nurture international youth leaders.
On the same day, the United States Secretary of Transport, Zhao Xiaolan, the United States Congressman Mon Zhao and the President of the International Leadership Foundation, Dong Ji-Ling, addressed the meeting.
In particular, they paid tribute to the first-line anti-epidemic Asian-Pacific medical workers and volunteers and called on the American public to continue to adhere to preventive norms such as “social distance” to curb the spread of the epidemic.
Dalian: No new coronary pneumonia locally confirmed cases, 24 new cases of non-symptomatic infections - Xinhuanet
On 25 July, the city of Dalian, Xinhua, released a message (journalist Tsai, Choi) on 25 July. Between 1500 hours on 24 July and 1400 hours on 25 July, there were no new locally diagnosed cases of coronary pneumonia in Dalian, and there were 24 new cases of non-symptomatic infections and no new suspected cases.
From 22 to 25 July, at 1400 hours, the city-wide cumulatively reported 12 locally diagnosed cases of new coronary pneumonia, all of which were treated centrally in isolation at the Sixth People's Hospital in Dalian City.
According to Zhao Lian, Deputy Director of the Dalian City Health Council, the city organized the presence of medical personnel from the city-wide level-III hospital in street communities, opened more than 600 sampling sites along Dalian Bay, the workers'village, the light track and in some of the focus areas of the new district of Kimp in accordance with the conditions of the epidemic, fully promoted the screening of personnel for nucleic acid, and mobilized nearly 2,000 medical personnel per day to test for nucleic acid.
As at 1400 hours on 25 July, over 210,000 samples had been taken across the city.
Ten out of the 12 confirmed cases in Dalian City are employees of the Dalian Kaiyang World Seafood Co. Ltd.; 46 out of 54 cases of unsymptomatic infections are employees of the company and their relatives; and 85 per cent of all positive cases of nucleic acid testing are related to the company's employees and their relatives.
It was concluded that Dalian City had decided to tighten strict control over close contacts with all employees of Dalian Ocean Seafood World Inc., as well as close contacts with close contacts, and to implement 14 days of centralized medical observation and at least two tests of nucleotide.
At the same time, the city of Dalian decided to further expand the implementation of centralized medical observation staff, with 14 days of centralized medical observation and at least 2 tests of nucleic acid for close contact with persons who test positive for nucleic acid (including cases and those who have no symptoms of infection).
The Dalian airport and Dalian railway station issued a 25-day circular stating that city-wide personnel who, in principle, were required to carry out non-necessary non-contiguous operations must have a negative certificate of nucleic acid testing for seven days; the Dalian bus terminal suspended the sale of all lines throughout the city from 1200 hours on 25th, with a specific recovery time to be notified.
The Brazilian study shows that hydrochlorine is not effective for new coronary pneumonia for the treatment of light-medium disease - the Chinese net.
In recent days, a Brazilian study has shown that hydrochlorinated naphthalenes are not effective for new coronary pneumonia patients with light stroke.
The study was published in New England Journal of Medicine.
Palestinian researchers divided 667 patients in 55 hospitals throughout the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials; mainly by comparing the treatment effects of the use of hydroxyl chloride alone or combined with other antibiotics, they analysed whether it would help to improve the condition of mild and moderate patients with new coronary pneumonia.
The results show that hydroxyl chloride not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have harmful side effects on the dirty apparatus.
The study was carried out in conjunction with the Brazilian Clinical Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Network for Critical Care Research (BRICNet) by various authoritative Brazilian hospitals, such as the Espital Israelia Albert Einstein Hospital, the Heart Disease Hospital (HCor), the Syrian Lebanese Hospital (Hospitan Sírio-Libanês).
On 25 local time, President Bossonaro of Brazil declared the fourth nucleic acid test negative through a social platform.
During the period of infection, Bossonaro has been taking hydrazine and has been actively promoting it on several occasions.

A new round of App governance in four sectors to protect personal information security - Xinhuanet
On 25 July, Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua, a journalist in Beijing (journalist Joon-ja, Chen Yiping) was informed by the National Network Office that in 2020, App's illegal collection and use of personal information governance had been officially launched in recent days, with a focus on countering strong questions such as the private uploading of personal information from the back of App.
According to the information received, this round of App governance was carried out jointly by four departments: the National Network, the Ministry of Labour and Communications, the Ministry of Public Security and the General Directorate of State Market Supervision.
It was reported that the four sector-specific working group on governance last year received more than 12,000 effective reports from Internet users, conducted checks on over 2,300 Apps, and imposed public exposure, interviews and other sanctions on 260 Apps, whose users were large and problematic.
According to the relevant officials of the National Networking Office, the number of Apps currently exceeds 5 million, and the issue of the collection and use of personal information in violation of the law has not yet been resolved.
Further efforts will be made in 2020 to further extend governance to SDK (software development toolkit) and micro-procedures based on App verification.
It was informed that the Working Group would conduct thematic studies and in-depth tests on the use of irregularities in the collection and use of personal biometric information, and on the misuse of sensitive competencies by App, with a focus on back-office abuses, such as recording and photographing.
Depending on the circumstances of the problem and the gravity of its consequences, the Working Group will be subject to such penalties as interviewing, warning, setting aside, fines and so on, in accordance with the law, as an effective deterrent against violations of the law.
It was understood that the working group was planning to develop guidelines for the management of the App Collection and Use of Personal Information Application Shop Audits, which would guide the application stores to ensure that they were properly pre-screened and closed down.
In addition, the Working Group will issue free technical tools to guide SMEs in conducting self-assessments and to improve the legal compliance of their personal information collection and use activities.
Johns Hopkins University: Over 16 million new world crown confirmed cases - Xinhuanet
New crown disease statistics released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States on 26 July by Xinhua New York on 26 July show that, as of 2.40 p.m. East 26 United States time (14.40 p.m. Beijing time), the cumulative number of new crown cases diagnosed worldwide amounted to 16048100 and the cumulative number of deaths amounted to 644537.
The data show that the United States is the most affected country in the world, with a cumulative total of 4178027 confirmed cases and 1,46460 deaths.
The cumulative number of confirmed cases in Brazil is 2394513 and the cumulative number of deaths is 86449, both of which are second only to the United States.
In addition, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Peru, Chile and the United Kingdom are among the countries with cumulatively more than 300,000 confirmed cases.
On 25th, the Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival 2020 and the first Red Cultural Industry Expo will open in Tsangshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry also faces the dilemma of a small number of young people, homogenization of tourism projects and a single channel for commercialization.
In particular, this year's outbreak hit the country's cultural and tourism industry severely and red tourist attractions face serious challenges.
For example, the use of scientific and technological means such as drone photography and VR immersion experiences can satisfy visitors' needs for “unattended and unattended” tours; the introduction of live webcasts to promote red scenes, which can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of “cloud” technologies, which create thematically prominent, well-directed and rich displays of red scenes, and which fully showcase and enhance their promotional functions; and the innovative dissemination of red culture to “live” revolutionary cultural objects, popularizing red tourism to keep red genes alive and increasing the attractiveness of red attractions.
The festival, which used the popular “District (District) Governor+Professional Masters” method to promote red-language features, and the use of 5G technologies to provide real-time viewing and intelligent city demonstrations to promote red-language attractions, were attempts to insert intelligent wings for red-tourism and to expect that the red-red-hunan tour would become more popular.
A representative of the US-China Trade Conference. A meeting in August.
On 25 August, the Hong Kong South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous source who reported that the head of the Chinese trade negotiation team, Deputy Prime Minister Liu Xuan, and the co-leader of the United States team, trade representative Lai Hae-chul, were expected to hold a formal meeting in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States.
It has been reported that, while China has significantly increased its procurement of United States agricultural products over the past few months, there is still some distance from the volume promised in trade agreements due to the new coronary virus epidemic, among other factors.
According to analysts, the recent closure of each other's consulates in the United States and China, coupled with other disputes, could undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first-stage trade agreement between China and the United States, which entered into force one month after its signature on 15 January, provided for a high-level trade framework team from both sides to meet biannually.
Informed sources revealed that the meeting would be “an important turning point” that would allow the parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, the same person said that if the tension between the United States and China led to a lack of willingness to talk at this time, both sides might agree that the telephone conference of 8 May between Rae Hae-chul and crane Liu had met the provisions of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since this year, relations between China and the United States have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes over the origins of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
President Trump, while boasting at the beginning of the year about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, has recently changed his attitude.
At a White House press conference, he said that, although China had recently purchased a record number of United States maize on a single day, and had bought a lot of soybeans, “this trade deal is more relevant to me than it was when it was reached”.
An anonymous Beijing government consultant also argued that a new round of trade negotiations was unlikely due to poor US-China relations, and that “trade issues have lost weight in US-China relations”.
But he revealed that China’s trade-related units still met on 23th to discuss a number of issues, including how to increase the volume of imports from the United States, “we have done our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.”
The Vice-President of the US-China Trade Commission said that it was “more important than ever” to maintain the initial phase of the agreement, and that China had made progress this year in further opening financial markets to US companies.
"It's better to talk than not to talk about it, though it may be treated as a mere routine," stated the analyst at the independent research firm Plenum.
Xinhua Society in Beijing on 26 July, a journalist (journalist Wei Yu Gon) was informed by the Ministry of Emergency Management that the National Preventive Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the National Food and Material Reserve Agency, were once again urgently transferring 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square metres of woven cloth and 130,000 square metres of earthwork cloth to Anguan, six categories of central stocks, in support of flood recovery and rescue efforts.
According to the head of the Department of Emergency Management, at present, high water levels are maintained in the middle and lower of the Yangtze River and in the Huai River basin, where the “Gang River flood No. 3 of 2020” was formed in the upper part of the Yangtze River and local risks increased.
The meteorological services expect heavy rains in Chongqing, Guizhou and the lower and middle areas of the Yangtze River over the next three days, and the situation remains very complex.
It was reported that, since entering the country, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed integrated national fire rescue teams to pre-position specialized rescue units in priority areas, participating in a total of 10364 flood rescue operations of various types, targeting more than 130,000 fighters, 17778 fire trucks and 11887 boats, rescued 377 people in distress, evacuated and transferred more than 107,000 people in distress.
Nazdak's Chief Representative for China: It's now China's best time node for IPOs in the United States - Economic Watch - a professional financial news site
Economic Watch Journalist Zhang Bin, as a result of the counterfeiting of Rising's coffee, more stringent regulation of the United States market, combined with a long period of valuation pressure, stress on the United States marketed central stock, and the recent launch of the return journey to Hong Kong by China's central chief executives such as Cyber and Kyundong.
In the recent past, shells, ideal cars, etc., have become more popular in the United States.
In the case of the epidemic and the Chinese crisis, is it the best time for Chinese businesses to go to the United States?
“In the case of recent IPOs, and in the case of companies going to the United States of America, IPOs are inherently unaffected. Instead, the market is now very good, and even now is the best time point for Chinese companies to go to IPOs in the last 10 years.”
The chief representative of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, China District, Xiao Sheng, stated at the “Sharing of shares at the 2020 summit of listed company leaders” hosted by snowball.
In April of this year, the US SEC and the US Public Corporation Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued a Statement on the Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information – Discussion of the Challenges of Access to Current Information for US Listed Companies with Large Businesses in China.
The statement indicated that, while international cooperation and coordination had increased significantly in recent years, problems in access to information persisted in the United States regulatory sector, and that SEC and PCAOB continued to face legal and practical challenges; in contrast to that document, the PCAOB website provided a detailed list of listed companies facing audit barriers and their audit institutions, with a large number of listed companies.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States Congress passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Bill, which introduced additional disclosure requirements for foreign companies to be listed in the United States.
The crisis did not affect the appetite of investors, as seen by the rich.
“When the news came out, everyone was horrifying about whether they could go to the United States in the future, but later we found out that the issues were not on the investors' side, and that the investors might ask them, or even become, standardized when they were on their way to the United States IPO, but that was not seen by the investors as an important factor in the investment and the non-investment of a Chinese company.
It is recommended that the current situation be viewed with as much common sense as possible.
This, of course, may appear to be the worst situation in the past two years, but the appetite of investors has not been affected in any way.
So the tide of IPOs in the United States will continue from now until the end of this year or before the United States elections.”
On 9 May this year, Kim Shanyun was officially listed in Nasdak, the United States, as the first Chinese company to go to IPO after the outbreak.
"Kim Shanyun's listing gives a great deal of confidence to the Chinese company that prepared the IPO."
Xiang Seong, for example.
In the first half of the year 2020, snowball released a report showing that 20 IPO-China enterprises went to the United States in the first half of the year, an increase of 17.6 per cent over the same period last year; In terms of total initial funding, 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion, a recovery from the same period last year, a rise of more than 52.4 per cent; In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health-care sector was prominent in the first half of the year, an increase of 100 per cent over the same period last year.
According to Chen Sheng, Chinese companies that went to the US for IPOs in the first half of this year were of high quality, with strong fundamentals and growth-oriented quality companies that would be more favoured by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Chen Sheng continues to be optimistic about Ming Chinese companies going to IPOs in the United States.
“In the short term, the tide of IPOs continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options: A shares, Hong Kong shares, United States shares, the United States general elections and China-United States relations will be considered as market choices and timing considerations; in the long term, everything will return to normality, with market fluctuations occurring in cycles, both political and economic, and eventually return to the normal stage, and the stock market will always be volatile.”
At the same time, he said that “there are many uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, regardless of whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are strong and grow as they can be seen by investors, other factors are relatively minor, and investors need to invest in good Chinese companies”.

Six months in the Heilong River, 22,000 DUIs - Xinhua Network
Xinhua Society Harbin, a journalist (journalist Leung Shuubin), learned from the General Directorate of Police of the Heilongjiang Public Security Department that in the first half of this year, the public security services throughout Heilongjiang province carried out a total of 22,000 drunk driving trips.
Recently, while on duty at the service station, the crane city traffic officer, once the driver was on duty with the traffic police, threw him off the bus and ran.
The police officers on duty pursued him quickly and captured the suspect Wang in the warehouse of a villager's house.
The result of the inflated alcohol tester was 28.4 mg/100ml, which was driven by a motor vehicle after drinking by one of Wang's members.
The police imposed fines of $2,000, a six-month suspension of a motor vehicle driver's licence and an administrative penalty of up to 12 points at a time.
Since the beginning of the year, the public security services of Heilongjiang Province have continued to combat the criminal offence of drinking and driving intoxicated, and there has been a social consensus on “drinking without driving, driving without drinking”.
However, driving was still a success, and in the first half of this year, the public security services conducted a total of 22,000 cases of drinking and driving, of which 3,744 were drunk.
Xinhua Network, an emergency transfer of more than 500 people.
On 26 July, Xinhua Xingqing (journalist Zhou Wen-yung and journalist Ko Ko Ko Ko-yang) learned from the Wulong District Government in Chongqing that heavy rains had led to a landslide and the formation of a lake, where more than 500 people were transferred in an urgent manner.
As a result of the continuing rains, since 22 July there has been a massive slide-drawing and deformation of the earthy body following the landslide in the mid-level group of the village centre of six wells in the village of Vulong district, which has fallen into the riverine tributaries.
On 25 February, a strong rainfall weather process and further landslides in the area disrupted road access along the village lanes and completely blocked the end of the river, resulting in the formation of a lake with a reservoir capacity of approximately 420,000 cubic metres of water at 13 metres in front of the dam.
On-site surveys have monitored a landslide of approximately 1.3 million cubic metres, which is still unstable, with fragments of rocks, a dam spill in Lake Cedar and a risk of dyke and a threat to downstream power stations and towns.
In the aftermath of the crisis, the local Government organized the evacuation of the riverine population overnight and the urgent transfer of the population to the security zone.
At present, 162 families and 520 people in the area of risk have been evacuated, and the disposal of Lake Tsuse is still under way.

People's Daily Commentator: Focus on getting things done, building new advantages for future development — the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneurs Symposium — Xinhua Network
Xinhua News, July 25th, Beijing, July 26th, commenter, People's Daily: Focusing on what's best for you, building new advantages for future development.
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain grave and complex, and the challenges facing our development are unprecedented.
Stabilizing our strategy, increasing our confidence in victory and focusing our efforts on our own is key to addressing our various risk challenges.
At the recent entrepreneurship symposium, Secretary-General Xi Jinping stressed that, in the current external environment of rising protectionism, a low world economy and shrinking global markets, we must concentrate on our own efforts to take full advantage of the country's mega-market advantages, gradually develop new patterns of development that are dominated by a large domestic cycle and mutually reinforcing domestic and international cycles, raise the level of modernization of the supply chain of industrial chains, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the closing of key core technologies and forge new advantages for future development.
The man of power wins. The man of power wins.
In an external environment of deep economic globalization, markets and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country, “two sides outside”.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, with more instability and uncertainty, and economic globalization is facing a backwind and a backsliding wave.
One of the most important aspects of preparing our economy for long-term thinking and work in response to changes in the external environment is the need to take advantage of the windfall and the distance of our economy, making the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand the strategic basis for development, taking full advantage of its strengths and giving impetus to the economic recovery of the world through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the opening up of the domestic cycle.
We want to be deeply aware that the long-term development and long-term security of our country are linked to the construction of a complete system of domestic demand.
The Party's central review of the state of affairs clearly sets out a firm strategy for the expansion of domestic demand, which is needed to respond to the impact of the epidemic, to sustain the long-term healthy development of the country's economy and to meet the growing need for a better life for its people.
The advantage of large economies is internal circulation.
Our country, which has the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, strong productive capacity, well-developed complementary capabilities, has more than 100 million market subjects and more than 170 million people with higher education or specialized skills, as well as a super-large domestic demand market of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, is in the advanced stages of new industrialization, informationization, urbanization and modernization of agriculture, with enormous investment needs.
The socialist basic economic system, such as the system of the socialist market economy, which is the subject of a mixed system of economic development based on the distribution of labour, the coexistence of multiple forms of distribution, and the system of socialist market economies, stimulates the dynamism of the various market players, liberates and develops social productivity, while promoting efficient and equitable organic integration and the constant realization of shared wealth.
We need to firmly grasp the strategic basis for expanding domestic demand, making production, distribution and circulation links more dependent on domestic markets for a virtuous circle, defining strategic directions for structural reform on the supply side, and promoting a dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
There is a need to accelerate the construction of a complete system of domestic demand, to vigorously promote science, technology and innovation and all other aspects of innovation, to accelerate the development of new and strategic industries such as the digital economy, smart manufacturing, health of life and new materials, to create new and additional growth points and poles, and to move towards a new pattern of development that is dominated by a large domestic cycle and mutually reinforcing domestic and international cycles.
Openness brings progress and closure inevitably lags behind.
Secretary-General Xi has repeatedly stressed that the door open in China will not be closed, but will only be wider.
The domestic cycle is by no means a closed-door exercise, but rather a stronger and more sustainable development by harnessing the potential of domestic demand to better connect domestic and international markets and make better use of both international and domestic markets and resources.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between the expansion of domestic demand and openness, and the smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to the construction of new patterns of openness and the more conducive it is to the emergence of new advantages for participation in international cooperation and competition.
While there is now a rise in international protectionist thinking, we should stand on the right side of history and insist on deepening reforms, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting an open world economy and contributing to the creation of a community of human destinies.
The Chinese nation has experienced many ordeals in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has grown stronger and stronger, growing from it and rising from it.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the Party's central centre, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the remarkable strength of the socialist system of China, its strong mobilization and strong combined strength, and the unity of the nation's entire army, we will be able to overcome all odds and odds, maintain the momentum of good economic and social development in our country, achieve the full realization of a small and prosperous society, and successfully embark on a new journey towards the full construction of a modern socialist State!
The rest of the proceeds are “after 90” and are “retaliatory” in order to save money.
As the balance money went down, not only did “after 90” not escape the balance, but instead began to save money “retaliatoryly”?
In the first half of the year, the “after-90” savings report, published by China's Institute of New Economic Research prior to the joint payment of the treasures, showed that the amount of money saved per capita was nearly 40 per cent higher than in 2019.
Interestingly, after 90, it's more likely to start with a small amount of money, with an average savings of 60% below $20...
Saving money with the balance has also become a “after-90” practice.
The data show that of the 700 million remaining treasure users, 134 million are “after 90”.
China has 174 million “after 90”, which means that about three out of every four “after 90” countries are saving their savings.
At present, the annualized rate of return on 7 days for monetary funds, such as the balance sheet, has fallen from above 2 per cent at the beginning of the year to around 1.5 per cent.
Even so, it does not affect the pace of “after 90” savings.
In the context of the “saving effect” of the balance treasures, many young people who are accustomed to using the balance treasures are also directly transformed into “fundamentals”.
Data on payment treasures show that, as at 13 July, the number of new “base people” on payment treasures had increased more than one-fold over the past month, and that an increasing number of young people were making progress on payment treasures.
According to analysts, the flow of funds from the balance sheet to the stock market was also an important reason for the clear decline in the IMF share in June.
The report also shows that “after 90” girls tend to save more, on average 20 per cent more than boys; 60 per cent of the users of funds on payment platforms are men, and women tend to choose a more prudent financial approach than men.
After saving money, what are the plans for “after 90”?
Payment Treasure data show that “after 90” is used to save money, with the largest number of users targeting travel.
As a result of the epidemic, many “after-90s” have saved money to prepare for post-epidemiological travel; the reopening of cinemas has also provided new avenues for moving from savings to consumption.
Let a bright party flag fly high on the river's embankment.
In recent times, the southern part of the country has been affected by successive rains and severe flood control has affected 26 provinces (districts and municipalities) in Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong and Hubei.
The disaster is an order, the disaster area is a battlefield, the party flag is a flag, and party organizations at all levels, party cadres and soldiers of the people are determined to implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping regarding disaster prevention and response, and to move quickly to the front line of flood prevention and recovery and to become the backbone of the population of the disaster area and a living force in the fight against the flood.
The colourful party flag is high on the flood embankment, a sign of loyalty and a call to duty.
In the face of the disaster, one party organization is a bastion of battle and one party official is a flag.
At the forefront of the fight against the flood everywhere, party organizations and a large number of party cadres demonstrated a high degree of loyalty to the party, heeding the Party's call from the centre, building an unbreakable steel fort and building a strong Chinese backbone with the courage to “see my” actions, “to follow me” and “to follow me first”.
The colourful party flag is high on the flood-resistant embankment and is the anchor of the position and the horn of the assault.
In the face of the floods, the party organizations at all levels moved quickly to blow up the flood “Supreme” and placed a bright party flag on the flood-resistant embankment. The party cadres, the soldiers of the people, were standing on the flood-resistant positions, using the party flag as a platform for their will and action, “Doesn't fall back from the flood” and became the strongest and most trustworthy barrier for the population in the affected areas.
The colourful party flag is high on the flood embankment, selflessly dedicated and responsible.
At a time of crisis, when the lives and property of the people are under serious threat, the party cadres, members of the people's families, and members of their families, selfless and committed, dared to take on the hard battle of winning against flood and disaster relief as the main battleground for comprehensive testing, behaviour and sustenance, as well as the military parade, it is this selfless dedication and commitment that greatly inspires the confidence and determination of the people in the affected areas to overcome the disaster and to rally the strong spiritual strength to win against flood and disaster relief.

The French Minister of Defence, Florence Palley, said on 24th that France would add hundreds of millions of euros to the space defence budget to develop a military force in space in order to guard against possible “unfriendly moves” by other countries in outer space.
Pali told the newspaper Provence on the same day that, between 2019 and 2025, the budget for spending on French space military projects would increase from €3.6 billion (approximately $4.2 billion) previously proposed to €4.3 billion (US$5 billion).
Under the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and modernize its space surveillance radar.
The President of France, Emmanuel Markron, announced last July that a military space command and an “aeronautical and space force” would be established within the French air force.
Pali stated that she would officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visited a military school in Salon, Provence district, later.
Pali said that the space force belonged to the air force and had a strength of 500 by 2025.
She said, "The idea that space used to be thought to serve the common good of science is gone. Space is now a place for nations to compete for global hegemony."
Pali reiterated what Markron had said before, saying that the French side had no intention of provoking an arms race.
“We are not in any way engaged in an arms race, but it is my duty to fully identify the threats we may face.”
Pali retraced the surveillance of a French-Italian military satellite in 2017.
She said, "Sneeping" was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denies this statement.
Pali said that France would soon have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and targeting “the dark hands behind those unfriendly moves”.
According to the French media, the reason for France's search for a space force was the request made last February by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, to the United States Department of Defense to draft a bill for the establishment of the Tai Air Force.
Trump signed the Defence Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the sixth largest United States army, the Pacific Air Force.
Some experts were concerned that those United States initiatives had accelerated the militarization of United States space and could trigger a new arms race in space.

In response to the follow-up problems encountered by the displaced population in terms of their integration into local life, a “neighbourhood house” was set up in the district of Xiangxi Ankang, in accordance with the practical innovations in the area, to guide the relocation of the villagers towards a sustainable, rapid integration and enrichment process.
It is located in the Qinba Mountains, where nearly one third of the population has moved out of the mountains through immigration.
This year, the 39-year-old Chai Yangjiang moved from the village of Nakamoto in Xiamen district to the community of the democratic town of Minju.
He came to the community's “neighborhood home” with his old-age insurance card and finished his pension insurance this year in less than two minutes.
At the beginning of this year, through the construction of “neighbourhood houses”, all employment, civil affairs, health insurance, etc., were integrated into the management of the operation, which was made possible by the relocation of the population at the door of the home.
In the Mingju community, 305 residents entered the local community's factories through information on recruitment in “neighbourhood houses”.
At present, all community factories have been made available in the 31 more than 100 collective settlements in the districts, providing 2,598 jobs.
The shared accommodation market was reported to have been warming since March - the new medium network
The recently released China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020 (hereinafter referred to as " the Report " ), published by the National Information Centre for Sharing Economic Research, this newspaper (journalist Yang Hak-kwei), shows that, in the first five months of 2020, the volume of trade in shared accommodation markets fell by 72.1 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
However, the shared accommodation market has been warming since March, and the volume of market transactions, orders and hospitality has been gradually restored.
The Report shows that the volume of trade in the shared accommodation market has declined significantly, owing on the one hand to a sharp drop in demand for travelling accommodation under the control of the epidemic, a sharp decline in the number of orders, a 65 per cent decline in the total number of orders over the previous five months and a 63 per cent decline in the number of recipients over the same period; on the other hand, the weakness of demand has led to a more marked decline in overnight prices, with an average of 16 per cent decline over the previous five months.
However, market turnover in March, April and May grew by 78 per cent, 199 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively; order number by 141 per cent, 152 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively; and receiving by-horizon by 81 per cent, 112 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively.
The Report notes that the development of the shared accommodation sector has long been promising, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In response, the Deputy Director of the Centre for the Sharing of Economic Research of the National Information Centre in Feng Xia stated to the Journal of Workers that the development of shared accommodation required stronger policy support, on the one hand, through the implementation of pre-existing policies, further strengthening of policy coherence and a focus on the creation of a better business environment, and, on the other hand, further strengthening of policy guidance and support in a variety of areas, such as stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovative service delivery and strengthening cooperation between government and platform enterprises.
According to Reuters, the world's largest steel producer, Anselemital, has experienced a new epidemic at a factory in Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico, where 21 people have died to date.
The Secretary-General of the local branch of the Mexican Union of Mining and Metallurgical Workers reported that the deceased included employees of the factory, contractors and suppliers.
Solorio said that 21 people had died at the factory since April, 9 of whom were trade unionists.
As a result of strict sanitary measures in factories, workers are at risk of contracting the virus outside the factories.
According to the trade union, the factory has more than 7,000 employees.
As at 25 July, Mexico had accumulated more than 385,000 confirmed cases, with over 40,000 deaths, and had the fourth highest number of new deaths worldwide.
On 26 July, China's famous vascular surgery centre, the Shanghai Hospital of Shanghai, the Naval Medical University, signed a contract with the Xiaoshan Hospital, affiliated to Xiamen University, to set up a collaboration centre to promote communication and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, particularly in the field of aortic acute diseases.
According to Nakayama Hospital, after formal collaboration between the vascular surgeons of the two hospitals, remote consultations will be conducted, treatment programmes will be developed with the real-time on-line consultations of the Changhai Hospital, refresher training will be provided, weekly joint surgical exchanges will be conducted, teaching rooms will be conducted, etc., and, in complex cases, experts in Changhai will be invited to operate in the hospital, depending on the patient's needs, thus making it possible for patients in the southwest to benefit from the country's top medical resources without going to the provinces.
The two hospitals will also work together on innovative surgical research, aorta disease and early screening, among others.
A workshop on the aorta, organized by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by the Nakayama Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University, was held in Xiamen on the same day.
During the same period, the two well-known hospitals held a signing ceremony for the collaboration centre for angiology and announced the formation of a joint unit to improve the treatment of angio-surgery-related diseases in the south-west of Guan.
The vascular Surgery of Shanghai Hospital is the only vascular Surgery Institute in the army and the only clinical centre for vascular system diseases in Shanghai City, as well as the first major national vascular Surgery programme, leading the establishment of the Specialized Committee on Intra-Atovasculars of the Chinese Medical Doctors'Association, which is the top team with deep in-house inspiracies.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Angio Surgery, Nakayama Hospital, attached to Xiamen University, gave an interview with the media.
The Xiaoshan Central Hospital is the first independent vascular surgeon in Fujian province, with a long-term commitment to treating aorta and peri-vascular diseases, and in 2018 was approved for the construction of a provincial clinical priority specialist.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to mesosphere aneurysm and aorta, there is considerable experience in the treatment of aneurysm in emergency cases.
“In view of the history of development, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the surgery performed by the Xiamen Hospital, affiliated to Xiamen University, we have been able to establish a collaboration centre which, in addition to the aorta, is able to carry out in-depth medical, pedagogical and scientific cooperation in the treatment of diseases such as the lower limb arteries, the carotid arteries, etc.”.
Professor Feng Wei, Deputy Director of Avascular Surgery, Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Chinashan Hospital, affiliated to Xiamen University, and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract in 2018 for the establishment of the “Li Moo Sheng Medical Clinic” for digestive medicine.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of the Institute's vascular surgery, in an interview with a Chinese-new network journalist, said that the Institute's vascular surgery had also been in contact with the Changhai hospital for a long time, and that the two hospitals had formally formed a collaboration unit to bring the two partners together to the new steps.
He said that the Institute would regularly invite Shanghai experts to exchange surgical techniques, study rooms, discuss difficult cases, etc., while further remote consultations were being carried out, which were currently planned to take place once a week; in addition, the Unit would also offer refresher exchanges to enhance the development and development of the academic workforce.
At the meeting, journalists learned that vascular disease was the leading cause of death in China and that the aorta, as the main artery for all organs of the human body, had an important role to play from the heart to the whole body.
The occurrence of an aorta disease is often accompanied by high risks, high mortality rates and the difficulty of treatment, with the thickest part of the aorta running up to 4 cm in diameter. Once an vascular tumor is formed, there is a break-up, or an endocrine rupture produces a membrane that causes haemorrhage, which is dangerous.
In recent years, as the lifestyle of people has changed and the pace of life has accelerated, China has become the world's largest high blood pressure, with an increase in anorexic diseases. Today, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, treatment of aortic diseases has continued to develop in a minimal, rapid and efficient manner.
Doctors can “variate” the blood flow properly by punctuating from their thighs and putting the rack in the aorta so as to avoid the impact of an aneurysm or a ruptured lacuna and achieve good therapeutic effects, some of which require even a local anesthesia.
More than a dozen national experts were invited to the seminar to discuss new advances in the treatment of aorta diseases and to conduct cutting-edge technical training and challenge case discussions in the form of a conference salon.
At the meeting, journalists were informed that, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, treatment for aortic diseases is continuing to develop in a small, rapid and efficient manner.

On 26 July, a journalist (journalist Han Yong) in Chongqing, China, was informed by the Chinese Railways Chengdu Group Ltd. that the entire length of the Cheng Wan Gorge tunnel, about 18.9 km long, was fully connected on that day.
It is understood that the three-thousand tunnels are not only the longest high-iron tunnels within the three-thmus reservoirs, but are also currently being built in the country with the design of the maximum single-hole double-line high-iron tunnels of 350 km/hour per hour.
On the territory of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, where Kinguang and Xu Langhai have reached Chongqing in the north of Chengzhou, Zhang Wangiang has reached Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou, is an important part of our “eight and eight” high-speed railway network, along the river and on the south-south corridor.
The San Gorge tunnel was fully functional on 26 days.
The figure is field-connected.
In Henan Province, the new lines were built at a rate of approximately 818 km, with a speed of 350 km/hour and approximately 184 km/hour in Chongqing, to the cities of Pingshan, Namyang, Xiaoyang, Hubei Province, and Wanzhou, Chongqing Province.
Of these, the Chengzhou to Xiangyang Sector became operational early on 1 December 2019, and the Chongqing Sector is stepping up construction.
The 26-day-long-long, three-thousand tunnel is a full-line control project for Cheng Wangong Iron. The project is located on the border between Chongqing and Sooshan counties. It is approximately 18.9 km long and is buried at a maximum depth of 890 metres.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and became fully operational on 26 July 2020.
According to the Royal Army, the director of the design of the Chinese Iron II Engineering Group of China, Cheng Wan Gao Tunnel, the company limited in responsibility for the exploration of the design, the geologic conditions of the location of the San Gorge Tunnel are very complex and exposed to the risks of rock solubility, mud pouring water, and large-scale deformation of soft rock, which are high-risk tunnels of level I, and whose design and construction are extremely difficult.
“In the course of the construction of the project, we adopted a special design for more than 30 types of solution holes, using geologic survey methods, object exploration methods and advanced drilling techniques. For example, a 24-metre-long bridge was designed to cross a large solution hole in a tunnel with a vertical length of more than 10 metres and a depth of more than 55 metres to avoid a tunnel sinking.” The Army of the Kingdom said.
According to the construction side's Central Iron Tunnel Authority, construction of the tunnel was carried out by means of a combination of decomposition, the construction of cross-clans, slurry of water, the reinforcement of the tunnel structure and the construction of a sewage treatment station, both to ensure orderly engineering progress and to avoid damage to the water bodies of the three canyon landscape, while successfully overcoming the construction difficulties of poor geological conditions such as a 7-km soft rock deformation, the maximum daily influx of water amounting to 157,000 cubic metres, etc.
The completion of the entire railway line will make it possible for the south-western part of the country to become a new accessible and fast-track main roadway to the central, north-eastern and north-eastern regions of China. It will be important to improve the capacity and quality of the north-eastern rail routes to the south-west, improve the layout of the regional road network, speed up the development and urbanization of tourism resources along the routes, promote the development of regional coordination and promote the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say it's unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the United States census for the allocation of seats in the House.
A number of civil rights organizations and several United States cities and counties have filed complaints against the United States federal Government alleging that attempts by the Presidential Office of Trump to exclude undocumented migrants from the United States census are unworkable and unconstitutional.
The United States census will determine the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
Sara Brannon, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union's executive lawyer, said to the American Voice, “It will not work”.
She went on to say that Trump called for the determination of the citizenship of the persons to be surveyed in the census to be difficult and “not very reliable”.
The administrative order of Trump was challenged on Thursday by another civil liberties organization, the Joint Careers Organization.
A number of cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the proceedings.
The case was also joined on Friday by Arlington County, Virginia State.
The Chairman of the Governing Board of Arlington County, Garvey, said, “The United States Constitution requires an accurate inventory of our population every 10 years. We must take an accurate inventory of everyone living in Arlington County and not let this illegal attempt to scare people and reduce the number of our immigrant communities succeed.”
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive decree.
According to the Minister of Justice of Alabama, Marshall, the executive order was a “win” for the state.
He said that “the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives of the National Assembly and the electoral college of the Länder must be based on the number of inhabitants residing in the Länder and the number of legal residents”.
Last year, the United States Supreme Court prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week to regulate the submission of unlicensed census data by the United States Census Bureau's Secretary of Commerce, Ross, in order to allow the Administration to exclude these undocumented populations from state census figures and to determine whether each state has increased or reduced or maintained the number of members of the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years, depending on demographic changes.
Thirty-three districts in Chongqing are hit by heavy rains.
Xinhua Society journalists from Chongqing City Anti-Drough Drought Control Command learned on 26 July that Chongqing City had received a new round of heavy rains starting on 25 July, with heavy rains in 33 districts and four small and medium-sized rivers with over-alert water level floods, and an emergency response level IV was launched in Chongqing City.
According to the General Hydrological Monitoring Station in Chongqing City, from 0800 hours on 25th to 0800 hours on 26th, the main area of Chongqing reached heavy rains, with heavy rains in 33 districts and districts, including Huanzhou, Yunyang and Nanchuan.
The largest amount of daily rainfall was recorded in the village of Ryushan in the town of Kansan, Nanchuan, at 197.5 mm.
As a result of the heavy rains, four small and medium-sized rivers in the Jiangjin region, as well as donkey streams in the Yangtze region, the Suyang River in the Kaizhou region and the Yunyang Bay River, have been flooded, and the water level is still rising.
The heavy rains also led to a landslide in the village of six wells in the territory of the Vulong district, disrupting road access on village roads, slipping into the tributary of the Ujiang, blocking the riverway to form a lake of dysentery, and urgently organizing a downstream mass transfer on the ground.
In response to the storm, at 1300 hours on 26 June, the Chongqing City Anti-Drough Drought Command issued early warning information on river flood level III and initiated emergency response level IV, requiring the relevant districts and units to reinforce patrols, mobilize emergency relief teams and supplies in a timely manner, and evacuate populations in threatened areas.
Responding to push for industrial projects -- looking at headlines -- Hunan Daily News -- on-line
Summer's Hunan, hot waves over the face.
On the other hand, the enthusiasm unleashed by the Ministry's industry-wide promotion of the site tour has gone beyond the heat of the summer and has been inspired by the clear direction of “industry versus industry and project heroism”.
The development of Hunan always depends on the construction of projects and the training industry.
During the first half of the year, under the strong central leadership of the party, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the province insisted on a game of chess, dedicated to the fight against the disease and the fight against the disease, using the industrial project as a “battle of first hand” for the implementation of the S6S.
From 1.9 per cent a year-on-year decline in GDP in one quarter to 1.3 per cent a year-on-year increase in the first half of the year, the difficulty of the period and the magnitude of the effort is self-evident.
On this highly valuable report card, industrial projects are the key underpinning for accelerated economic recovery and stable development in Hunan.
It's easy, it's irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects must be carried out in a way that is both dynamic, aggressive and resourceful, as well as sensitive to, and responsive to, change.
In the context of the current complex and serious international situation, in addition to the enormous effort to attract resources, it was necessary to study the new features of the current situation, to be more regular and scientifically precise and to be better integrated into the new development landscape, which was dominated by a domestic cycle and promoted by a two-tier domestic and international cycle.
Increased focus on upgrading industrial infrastructure.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavy-level investment projects in new and emerging industries begin to develop, but also created hope, and more traditionally advantaged industry firms accelerated the process of digitalization, intellectualization and greening of industries.
The Yooyang Oscon III Science Park project has adapted the existing production lines, leading to the creation of smart production lines for high-end printed circuit boards; the process of building a modern factory in Hunan's new factory is also animated by the transformation of intelligence and the construction of a modern factory... It is around the country's major strategy and the “two new priorities” to strengthen the industries that are in the best position, to actively foster the development of new industries, and to increase science, technology and innovation and national production alternatives in a comprehensive manner in order to keep the basic conditions in place and build up the capacity of the country's transformational energy.
Increased focus on fostering new business models for the development of the new economy.
The sudden emergence of the new crown epidemic has led to a “clouds economy” that has stimulated the potential of the digital economy and provided new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, the manufacturing of computer and office equipment, electronics and telecommunications equipment in our province grew by 12.6 per cent, the retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the limit grew by 32.2 per cent and the online food bill in catering businesses by 35.6 per cent.
New opportunities have been created in the midst of the crisis, new opportunities have been created in the context of change, and efforts have been made to promote digital industrialization, digital industrialization and the integration of the digital economy and the real economy.
Increased focus on optimizing and stabilizing industrial chain supply chains.
Engineering machinery is the main force of the Hunan industry, but two thirds of the supporting enterprises are out of the province and there is still scope and potential on the chain.
The strengthening of the industry-chain thinking capture project involves not only sustained stock-taking by leading enterprises to achieve technological breakthroughs at key points in the industry chain; it also needs to be nurtured at the local level so as to stimulate the “chain” chain reaction with a strong chain-to-chain extension, to promote a coordinated layout of the relevant supporting industries, and to accelerate the building of autonomous, secure and reliable supply chains in the industry chain.
It is still a hot ground and a happy ground for business in Hunan, which has a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
(b) The “shareholder-type” service implemented by Xiaoyang, which provides business with “shareholder-type” services that do not push, do not fail in their policies, solve problems at night... In the process of recovering the damage caused by the epidemic, there are various “many ways” to find short-term pains and to create living stories of what is at stake.
A focus on industrial research, the nurturing of industry, the development of industry and the solid optimization of the business environment will certainly win the favor of more investors.
While the wind is still on the front, the state of the storm has become the norm of building industrial projects and promoting high-quality development throughout the province.
During this critical period, it is important to learn and implement the spirit of the series of important instructions of Xi Jinping's Secretary-General, to respond effectively to external uncertainties with certainty in his own work, to sustain the construction of industrial projects, to share passion and sweat, and to ensure the successful completion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the full realization of a small and prosperous society.

To foster a new business, open a new space for employment -- a new network in the middle.
New forms of employment are emerging, opening up new spaces for employment, and a number of innovative service policies have been introduced to support the growth of new forms of employment.
According to the latest data of the National Statistical Office, the rate of unemployment in the National Urban Survey in June was 5.7 per cent, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from May.
This has also been the case since April, when the national urban survey investigated the two consecutive drops in unemployment rates, which have been followed by a monthly decline in unemployment data by the emergence of new and emerging employment opportunities.
Guo Mei is increasingly motivated by the fact that he now earns over 5,000 a month, coupled with a new sense of embrace of information technology.
At the innovative incubation base in the transition and transformation demonstration area in Shanxi, there were more than 2,300 data taggers.
Not only are the data labelers, the State has, since this year, made 25 occupational definitions of nucleic acid testers, online learning service providers, etc. into new occupations, developing vocational skills standards, introducing skills training programmes, and providing a bottom-up contribution to the development of practitioners.
The State is also in the process of innovating employment services for new forms of employment and new entrepreneurship paths.
In recent days, 13 departments, such as the National Development Reform Commission, have jointly issued an Opinion on Supporting the Development of Healthy New Industrial Patterns to Activate Consumer Markets to Promote Employment, which provides diversified employment opportunities for workers.
The multisectoral sector will jointly nurture new individuals in the market and further reduce the cost of entrepreneurship employment on the basis of self-employed individuals; and policies will be introduced to make new business operators more secure, with flexible employment rights and benefits, social security, and so on.

The overall level of employment and prices shows that the economy has a “temperature” - a new net.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows a “temperature” of the economy.
Journalist of the Economic Daily, China Economic Network, Lin Fing Chan
During the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, our country has made concerted efforts to prevent and control the epidemic and to promote economic and social development. The situation has continued to improve. The steady economic recovery has been evident. Employment and price performance, which are closely related to human life, have generally been stable, and the Chinese economy has handed over a temperature-based economic performance report.
During the first two months of the year, there was an increase in the survey unemployment rate.
In particular, in February, production operations in many enterprises were largely halted, demand for labour in enterprises was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and unemployment in urban surveys increased.
As the situation in the prevention and control of the epidemic gradually improves, the entire society has been able to restore order in its productive life.
In keeping with the overall thrust of the Party's middle-level work, the Party's central government has further intensified its macro-policy symmetry, strengthened its employment-priority policy in a comprehensive manner, and actively promoted its support for job-building.
We have stepped up our policies to secure jobs, set up a “reduced return” policy package, granted periodic reductions to the contributions of three social insurance units, allowed delays in the payment of social insurance contributions, expanded the return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, benefited from the employment replacement policy, and provided subsidies for the inclusion of priority groups in enterprises, internships, etc.
With the poor implementation of stable employment policies, the demand for employment in enterprises has risen steadily, the employment situation has gradually improved, the urban unemployment rate has declined steadily, and in June it was 5.7 per cent.
The Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Statistical Office, Zhang Yi, stated that in the second quarter employment policies had continued to work, with the return of the labour force that had withdrawn from the previous period due to the effects of the epidemic, and that the urban labour force participation rate had risen by about 10 percentage points from February in June, close to the same level last year.
The data show that total urban employment grew by more than 19 per cent in June compared to February, with most industries reaching pre-epidemiological levels; the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours from February and a slight increase of 0.1 hours from January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January of this year, CPI increased by 5.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis, reaching its highest level in many years.
In February, the year-on-year increase of CPI, though slightly lower, was still in “5-blocks”.
CPI is in a high position with both the pre-spring consumer demand pull factor and the lower spring staggered and same-year base factor.
However, the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly evident.
In January and February, there were delays in logistics, delays in the supply of supplies and increased costs of transporting goods throughout the country, as well as a marked increase in the price of part of the basic necessities, as a result of the build-up of some citizens.
In response to the disruption of the price situation caused by the epidemic, the authorities have included vital goods in their emergency transport guarantees and ensured their smooth movement.
The market supply of vegetable melon fruit is strongly secured through a range of policy initiatives.
In response to the rapid increase in the prices of pork at the beginning of this year, the Central Government has put in place a policy of stable prices, which has been implemented rapidly in all regions and sectors. The supply of stocks of pork has improved significantly, the production of pig meat has been restored in an orderly manner, and the production and distribution order has gradually become normal.
Since March, prices of pork have declined continuously, with food prices driving up to 10.6 per cent year-on-year in May; in June, the prices of pork have risen slightly, as a result of factors such as a slowdown in the birth of pigs, a decrease in imports and a rebound in demand for group consumption.
Seasonal changes in the prices of fresh food were marked, with an average increase of 3.4 per cent in the first half of the year.
As a result of the higher comparison base over the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to fall year-on-year, with an average decline of 13.3 per cent in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the population is effectively guaranteed and the economic and social situation is stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transport logistics, there has been an increase in local supply support and an improvement in market supply and demand.
Beginning in March, the CPI ring declined for four months in a row, from 4.3 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in June, and price levels generally recovered flat.
In the second half of the year, prices will continue to remain moderate and overall inflationary pressures will remain low, but it will still be necessary to promote a return to productive order in the context of the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in agricultural staples, such as food, fruit and vegetables, and strengthen market regulation in order to combat the destabilizing effects of the hoarding of quirks, price-lifting and so on.
Maun was summoned by the Indian court?
Ali: An official response from non-Ali - China New Network
Ali: “Official response” by non-Ali.
In the afternoon of 26 July, a foreign media report reported that a court in New Delhi, the capital of India, had summoned the founder of the UC India, the founder of Alibaba, Maun, and more than a dozen other executives for a former employee suit.
In response, the Chairman of the Al-Baba Market Public Relations Committee, Lord Wang, wrote a humorous message in his circle of friends saying that UC-India was following the process, but as for Maun himself, he said, “I don't know.
I've been looking all day and I've been looking for him tonight at HHB."
Another Ali confirmed to the central and eastern latitude clients that the so-called Ali's official response “UC has been firmly committed to serving the Indian market and protecting the welfare of local workers, and that the policy is in line with local law.
Since the matter is still pending in the trial, it is not possible to comment further on this issue.”
It was not from the Ali side.
McDonald's: More than 14,000 shops across the United States will require customers to wear masks.

Heilongjiang launched a campaign to clean up the new Chinese network by using the name of a well-known hospital
In recent years, irregularities and inappropriateness in the names of some health-care institutions have led to misleading public access to health care by using the name of a well-known health-care institution without legal authorization.
Upon enquiry into the National Corporate Credit Information System, the names of registered medical institutions in Heilongjiang Province contain the names of well-known medical institutions, such as “association” and the use of well-known hospitals, such as “consortium”, to operate abroad, disrupting the normal medical order and causing adverse social effects.
At the same time, it will be used as an opportunity to carry out a variety of legal literacy campaigns to raise awareness of the responsibilities of market subjects, to defend their rights in accordance with the law and to operate in compliance with the law.
By opening up the channels for reporting complaints, a number of typical cases of adverse effects are brought to the attention of society, with a deterrent effect.
30 electric competitions have been registered, and Shanghai Pudong has expanded the new economic "New Race" - Xinhua Net
On 25 July in Shanghai, Xinhua Society (journalist Tengani), on the 24th of July, 30 priority electric competition projects landed in the East New District of Shanghai, from stadiums to games to businesses, covering the whole category of electric competitive industry development, and are expected to generate an additional $10 billion in the regional competitive game industry.
The digital culture industry, represented by electric games, will become a new growth point for the new online economy in Pudong, helping to build a global electricity capital in Shanghai.
In the case of electric competitions, on the basis of existing high-level arenas such as the Mae Ben Cultural Centre, the Orient Sports Centre and others, new ones, such as the Puradong football stadium, the Specialized Electronic Space Senlan Electric Gallery and the East Chang Gaming Space, have been identified as landing sites in Puradong.
Wang Hyeon, General Manager of the Senlan Landing of the Upper Overseas High Bridges Group, told journalists that an indoor complex of about 1,500 square metres could accommodate 1,000 people, and that construction was under way, with the introduction of competitions expected in March next year, with 120,000 square metres of greening parks on the side of the auction hall, and the introduction of recreational elements such as a moving double dollar, in conjunction with the electronic general entertainment industry.
With regard to the electric accoutrements industry, Pudong has focused on improving the layout of the industrial chain.
The world’s champion teams, such as the Internet Dragons, have opened their doors at the signing event, and the country’s only video video game digitized channel – games and games – has moved to Puradong.
On the side of the race, Pudong actively sought to find the best international and domestic competition in order to create an unchallenged electric season.
A series of electric competitions, such as the International Cup of Peace Excellence 2020, and the Xicaca electric competition, were announced in Pudong.
On the business side, Pudong focuses on promoting the landing of head enterprises.
For example, Naowon's plan to launch dozens of game products in Pudong will also actively launch new projects aimed at generating 10 billion yuan in revenue, such as Web-based snowstorms, perfect worlds, fun games, etc.
Statistics show that Pudong currently has one third of Shanghai's electric games industry.
A number of top players, such as tungsten, web-friendly, head games, have landed in the field, and a number of top players, such as the TI9 and the King's Glory Winter Games, are taking place in Pudong, which is becoming a “hard heart” for the development of the Shanghai electric competitive industry.
The concentration of the high-quality electronics industry in Pudong is also dependent on the support of relevant policies.
In the recent past, the Chinese Academy of the Play Industry has been located in Pudong, setting high standards for industry.
Pudong's group of star schools were awarded the “Shanghai City Pilot School for Vocational Education and Electronic Competing”, which provides the basis for the development of talent in the electronics industry.
The registration system of electric athletes has taken the lead in Puradong, further increasing the level of professionalism of electric campaigners.
The Director of the Humanist Tourism Bureau of Pudong District, Huang Xing, said that he had proposed the construction of a “core functional area for the development of the Shanghai electricity industry” around the goal of creating a “global electricity capital” in Shanghai.
The next step, Pudong, will continue to focus on priority events, priority enterprises and accelerate development and the formation of industrial chains.
Using the policy of the Shanghai free-trade pilot zone to pre-test and explore innovations for upgrading the overall development of the electricity-competing industry to generate replicable and replicable experiences.

In the 1980s, Arthur Miller came to China under the mediation of Young Chochen and others to rehearse his work for the Beijing culture.
The reading of this script, which is entirely composed of a class of young performers from Beijing, was rehearsed for two weeks under the leadership of director Tang Xuan, and each person created a small legend to provide an in-depth analysis of the characters so that, after nearly 40 years, it could be re-examined and the realist drama rekindled.
Today, the opening ceremony of the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival and the opening of the first Red Cultural Industry Fair is held in Sasayama.
The Red Tourism Culture Festival was opened by the Minister of Communication of the Provincial Council and the Provincial Council, Zhang Hongsen, and was addressed by Vice-Governor Wu Guiying.
The Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival, which has been successfully held, is a well-known brand name for red tourism throughout the country.
The festival was co-sponsored by the Ministry of Communication of the Provincial Councils, the Department of Culture and Tourism of the Provinces and the Municipality of the Cantonal Council.
He said that it was important to follow up on the important instructions of Secretary-General Xi to “use red resources well, build on red traditions, transmit red genes well” and further pursue our development of red tourism, promote the revival of the Brunei market and bring the “red forces” together into a broad convergence of efforts to build a prosperous and happy new lake.
The promotion of the red culture, the transmission of the red spirit, the stimulation of cultural consumption and the promotion of quality development in the Hunan Brigade will certainly play a more active role.
At the opening ceremony, two events were launched simultaneously: the "Red Dynasty" (Red Dynasty of China) and the "Return to Long March, Crossing the Ribbon" (Red Dynasty of China).
During the festival, events will also be held, such as a marketing and contracting ceremony for the industrial project, the Red Tourist Forum and the Red Education and Training Seminar, the Red Wisdom Brigade Experience Fair and the sharing of new technologies, and the “Single Waters, Cultures and Cultures” Hunan Mountain Invigorations.
During the opening ceremony, the leaders and guests of Zhang Hongseng and Wu Gui Ying visited the site of the first Red Industry Fair in Beijing and watched the scene show of " China Out of Mao Zedong ".

On July 26th, China's new network Qinghai Hainan called "The Flower Room" on the shores of Qinghai: "Sweet" with goods to help farmers increase their harvest.
Author, Hu Guilong, Pan Yu Jie
“On the shores of the summer Qinghai lake, with golden flowers and bees flying, high elevations, large night and day temperatures and low air pollution, strong light breeds the most tenacious and generous bees, creating the characteristics of the king's magma, high protein, high nutritional value, low sugar and low lipid.”
On 26 June, the Deputy Director-General of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous State Industrial and Information Authority of Qinghai Province, Zhang Jianhoon, stated that
On that day, a live delivery of the products of the “Commonwealth of War-Assisting Farmers” was held on the shores of Lake Qinghai, where representatives of the Chinese Beehives Association and entrepreneurs and bee farmers gathered together to promote Qinghai Special Bee products. A total of almost 10,000 bottles of the Qinghai Plateau bee magma were sold on the line, bringing a total cargo of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The map shows bee products at the bee farmer's site.
According to the information received, the live feed campaign facilitated exchanges between “business + bee farmers + growers” and continued distribution of “Spring Pills in the Qinghai Sea” to consumers through online and offline channels, with the help of well-known domestic bee vendors, such as the Beijing-Hide Bee business chain network, fast-handedness and treasure-grabbing, live broadcasting and power-marketing platforms, and is expected to yield a total of approximately $5.28 million in profits throughout the year.
In this regard, the President of Beijing's Khydrome Beehives Corporation, Inc., Xuana, said that it was “very worthwhile”: “This could increase the visibility of Qinghai Bee products, attract more consumers to know, prefer to add no pure natural bee products, and lead to an increase in bee farmers' harvest”.
At present, the company has entered into a production cooperation strategic agreement with the Qinghai Cloud Bee Industries Ltd. and the Qinghai Bau Bees Co-operatives Company to jointly promote the growth of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The figure is a flower of oil on the shores of Qinghai.
In the spring, roads were blocked in various parts of the country because of the need to prevent and control the epidemic, the way the bee farmers “go after the nectar” was blocked, and many of the bees died as a result of missed flowers and lack of food and their income was severely affected.
“As a year goes by, the beekeepers travel long distances from Yunnan to Sichuan northwards to the northwest, and they have a hard time living in open and unsettled accommodation.
As businesses, we have a responsibility to help them.”
Guna called it.
“Bees are `environmental scouts' and highly contaminated areas cannot survive.” Zhao Xiaochuan, Managing Director of the Chinese Bee Products Association, explained that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the quality of crops, especially in widely grown and poorly managed areas.
Research data show that pollination increases the production of oilseeds by about 15 - 30 per cent.
The figure shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right) Vice-President of the Chinese Bee Products Association, who introduced Qing Hae-bee products.
“The economic, ecological and social benefits of bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves, and the bee industry has great potential for human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, which has been poorly known.”
Zhao Xiaochuan said so.
Today, the number of beekeepers is decreasing, and there are many poor households that are unable to move, in addition to long-standing bee farmers, to choose to enter stock cooperatives in beehives.
“The State has financial support, we have contacts with technical staff to help guide, and bee farmers lack knowledge and judgment about the market environment, and they also need the help and coordination of Governments, enterprises and industry associations to open up their markets.”
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
“We hope that in the future we will pay more attention to and help the bee-keeping community,” Guna said, “Our bee products are also screened and regulated in strict accordance with national standards, ensuring quality and protecting consumer rights while helping the bee farmers”.
As a result of the continuing rains, since 22 July, the mudslides following the landslides in the mid-level group of the village of six wells in the land of Chongqing Wulong district have broken up, causing large-scale slide-shifting and deformations that have completely cut off the river, creating 13 metres of water in front of the dam and measuring a reservoir capacity of about 550,000 cubic metres.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, Chongqing maritime authorities decided to impose temporary traffic controls on the waters from the Yangtze boundary pallet to the beach.
According to the Meteorological and Hydrological Department of Chongqing, since 25 years, heavy rains have been prevalent in the mid-western and north-eastern areas of Chongqing, with heavy rains in some parts of the country.
On the evening of 26 June, the small river dam station will have its highest water level and its maximum level will be close to the alert level.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, Chongqing maritime authorities decided to impose temporary traffic controls on the waters from the Yangtze boundary pallet to the beach.
Following an emergency meeting between the Chongqing City Defence Office and the meteorological, hydro, hydrological and other departments and units, the Chongqing City Drought Control Command decided to release early warning information on river flood level III and to initiate emergency response on level IV.
The Chongqing City Command for Drought Control demanded that all districts of Chongqing North, Shaping Dam, Tsang Nam, Wulong and Chongqing City pay high attention to rainwater conditions, in particular the Yangtze River, Kayang River and Uang River, and to the changes in water, to carry out early analysis, to issue early warnings and to strengthen the duty of the patrols, to evacuate the population in threatened areas with determination and determination, to mobilize emergency relief teams and supplies in a timely and efficient manner, to deal with the disaster (risk) situation and to avoid mass deaths and injuries.
The Minister-Counsellor Chung of the Embassy of Viet Nam in Laos, representatives of the Lao Viet Nam Buddhist Association, the Lao Viet Nam General People's Association, the Vientiane provincial government representatives, the Lao Association of Veterans, etc. participated in the ceremony.
The solemn ceremony was held in a solemn atmosphere, and representatives continued to pay tribute to the heroes for their great service and for their special ties of solidarity.
In his address, Minister Counsellor Chung stated that this was an opportunity for the old Vietnamese and Lao people to remember the greatness of the two countries'revolution and to express their gratitude together for the sacrifices made for their independence and freedom, as well as a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall that the two countries worked together to fight against the common enemy, for national independence, for national unity, for the common building of national development and for the consolidation of relations between the two countries.
Seventy-four years ago, on 23 January 1946, 28 fighters of the old Viet Nam fighting coalition were bravely killed in the attack on the Phonehe stronghold.
This attack was won as a historic victory for both countries in the early stages of their struggle for a national liberation revolution.
Ms. Chung stressed that the peoples of the two countries had always borne in mind the dedication of those who had sacrificed their lives in the cause of the struggle for national liberation, while stressing that the young regions of the two countries would continue to build on the heroic and strong traditions of their predecessors and make their due contribution to the continuation of old relations and to the prosperous development of the two countries.

According to Italian media statistics, the open-air fight against Genoa was the 3000th match in the history of the international Milan team, and the Blue Black Army was the first team to unlock this milestone.
Since the re-establishment of the League in 1929, Milan International has been the only team that has never been absent, and the only team that has never been downgraded.
According to Italian media reports, the international contest between Milan and Genoa was the 3000th competition in the history of the Blue Black Army.
In this landmark battle, the International Milan Hotel won Genoa with three goals.
The Lukakoume campaign, which was launched twice, also contributed a ball for Sanchez, who was present on the field.
From the start, the race entered the rhythm of international Milan, and the assault finally turned into a goal at the 34th minute.
Billage left was passed on, and the head ball broke down in the middle of the Lukacu road.
The 82nd minute of international Milan's fight, after Moses' right-hand breakthrough, was followed by a hit-and-run in the middle of the Sanchez road; at the end of the scene, Lukakou completed the second degree of May Queen and counter-attacked Brozović at a long distance, and Lukaku broke into the restricted area and ran over Romero and threw an empty door score at 3:0.

The statement stated that the drone had fallen inside Lebanese territory while on mission near the Blue Line on the Israeli-Lebanese border.
The statement did not mention the cause of the drone crash.
Israeli media reported that the drone could have crashed as a result of a malfunction.
It was reported that Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Gantz, during his visit to northern Israel in the afternoon, had stated that Israel would continue to take action against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel has long regarded Hizbullah in Lebanon as a major security threat and has accused the Iranian side of sending weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon through the Syrian land corridor, and there has been tension in the vicinity of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
Israeli air strikes against targets in the Syrian Arab Republic have been carried out on several occasions on the basis of attacks against the organization.

On July 16th, at 7.30 p.m., Liu Yunlong, Yin Fei, led by Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Conghua, Li Li and others, arrived at the Guangdong Vigilant Theatre.
The play described the horrifying conspiracy of the Japanese army to assassinate the head of the Japanese operatives, in association with the Soviet agents of the Chinese Communist Underground (Liu Yunlong) who were lurking at the Japanese pseudo-police station.
The Winner, adapted from historical facts, was drawn from the Soviet military archives, which had been sealed for many years.
During the Moscow defence war, the Red Army of the Soviet Union came to the sharp west of the Far East, when the Japanese Kandong Army's “northern advance party” considered it to be a viable force and intended to be a soldier.
In an effort to remove the danger to the enemy, the Communist Republic of China, together with the intelligence services of the Soviet Union, has implemented the “Moodamoula” programme.
According to this historical background, the well-known screenwriter, Deng, has been grinded several times, leading to a frenzy of frenzy.
Liu Yunlong this time, in Winning, was both a producer and a leading man.
In the play, Tang Fei, who is the head of the Criminal Section of the Lim River Police Department, is a happy, even a bit of a grumpy stun police officer and is a member of the Communist Underground Party in his true identity.
Tsai, who is the chief of the Lim River Security Bureau, has a deep appreciation of Japan's superior Fukuhara and a delicate relationship with Tang Fei, as well as an enemy and an obscurantious one.
Su Qing has tried many different roles in recent years, ranging from Rui Yuen in " We are Young " to "Yanjin ", which impressed the audience and was recognized for acting.
This is the first time that Su-Qing and Liu Yun-Long have partnered, and the stun police chief has been paired with the Xiaomei Policewomen's set-up, which is interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two main actors, the Winners included a large number of powerful actors such as Liang Conghua, Li Li Qun, Chan Bo, Rhehan and Xin Xin, and one of the scenes.
It is also known that Winning was well produced and that the team was able to film the scene almost 2,000 kilometres across the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning 3.
In an effort to restore the urban landscape of the former north-east Japanese era, the team of art and props was working day and night, carefully grinding the scene and the details of the props, which gave the scene an excellent and historic view.

In addition, a total of dozens of houses were destroyed by flooding in the northern part of Hodeida province and in the southern part of El Hadj province, and parts of roads and agricultural land were damaged to varying degrees.
The military conflict that lasted several years led to the near collapse of Yemen's health system.
According to United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs statistics, more than 1 million people have been infected with cholera in Yemen since 2017, with more than 2,000 deaths.
Yemeni health-care institutions fear that continued flooding will lead to a resurgence of the cholera epidemic.

Liao William, Dong Woo, Yang Xinjun and Wang Xianbo, leading the online film " The Jedi Strikes ", led by young directors, are officially shown in the art of Aichi.
The film tells the story of the fallen boxer, Venus, who returned to the ring and fought for dignity, and shows a bloodbathing journey of dreams.
The film "Thai Fist", which is driven by Thailand's main case, uses Thai boxing as the starting point for the dream-making of the failed Chinese champion Venus. The whole story is based on the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values, whether Venus was determined to fight fake fists for his master's sake in the early days or, at a later stage, re-energized his efforts to fight for dignity with the support of friends and lovers, demonstrating the desire and great love of men for their families and dreams in China's traditional culture.
Together with the classic Hollywood sports film story model and the strong involvement of the Chinese and Thai professional teams, the Jedi Strikeout not only has the effect of internationalization, but will also impress different types of viewers.
At the same time, The Jedi Strikes extensively showcased Thai boxing and training scenes of intense and hot blood.
In the video, the game designer, Zhang Xiaoqiang, who was played by Dong Woo, helped the Venus, who was played by Liao William, to return to the ring and take off his cinnamon by helping to combine the new miraculous high-tech with a hot-blooded competition. It also showed the brotherhood of Zhang Xiao Xiao Liang and Venus, which seemed to be “different” from the same goal.
In addition, the glimmer of love between Venus and Crystal is moving, and the constant silent support for Venus and the firm commitment of Venus to Crystal have made it possible for the audience to see the “iron-han tenderness” on Venus and to add a great deal of emotion to this champion.

We're starting a new mix of green land, and Shanghai funds are transferring 17.5% of the shares.
On 26 July, the Green Land Holdings (600606.SH) issued an indicative notice that state-owned shareholders would agree to transfer a portion of the company's shares and shares in a relic by means of a public call on the transferees.
The announcement indicates that, in order to further deepen the reform of State-owned enterprises, optimize the restructuring of State-owned investments and improve the structure of green land equity, the shares to be transferred by means of a public call for the transfer of part of the company's holdings by means of an agreement between Upper Haiti (Governance) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Senior Haiti”) and Shanghai (Governance Group) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Shanghai Capital”) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Shanghai Capital”) do not exceed 17.5 per cent of the total stock of the Greenland.
The price of this proposed transfer of shares is not less than the average arithmetical value of the daily weighted average price for the first 30 trading days (27 July 2020) of the indicative announcement date; and the value of net assets per share audited by a company for the most recent fiscal year.
At present, new strategic investors in greenfields remain open and, on the basis of public announcement information, it is estimated that 17.5 per cent of the shares transferred in this greenfield mix will need to be disbursed in the order of $14 billion.
It is worth noting that, after the transfer of the shares has been completed, it is expected that the greenfield will remain free of controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but that the structure of control may change significantly.
Since its creation, green land holdings have undergone a number of institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, they operated under a purely State-owned system in accordance with market-based rules; from 1997 to 2013, a system of State-owned and employee-owned shares was established and continuously improved; from 2013 to 2015, strategic investors were introduced into a mixed system of State-owned and non-public-owned capital swaps and mixed ownership; and from 2015 to date, the entire market has become a public company.
The current mix-up programme in the Greenlands is similar to that in Grail, which in December 2019 took over 15 per cent of the shares of the Glycerine Electric (000651.SZ) at $41,662 million with the title of High Cap Capital, which, after completing the mix-up, implemented modern business management practices such as the High Management Incentive Scheme, the Uncontrolled People's Structure, etc.
In the words of the Chairman and President of the Green Land Holdings Corporation, which is a group of State-owned enterprises fully owned by the Shanghai State Finance Committee, Shanghai is an important step towards comprehensive reform of State-owned enterprises in Shanghai and the acceleration of a new phase of reform of State-owned enterprises, in keeping with the party's central requirements. This is a clear demonstration of the new approach to reform, adapted to local conditions and tailored to suit local circumstances, by introducing new strategic shareholders to listed companies, supporting enterprises in further enhancing marketization, enhancing the freedom of business management and accelerating the full release of the dynamic of reform.
The first trip across the country to open the Xinhua Network.
On 25 July, at 12.20 p.m., Xinhua Xinhua State (journalist Li Ping), more than 200 Shanghai tourists travelling on the D771 drive successfully arrived in the city of Lang Creek, Zhejiang Province, the first cross-provincial tour of the country since the resumption of the inter-provincial (district and city) team tour by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism on 14 July.
It is located in the middle and west of the Zhejiang city of Lang Creek, where there are numerous attractions, such as Gossiphu village, Chang Ha underground and Shizu village, and during the two-day and one-night journey, more than 200 Shanghai tourists will take a look at these attractions.
The Deputy Managing Director of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (GATT) Ltd., Lilly, said that the company, in line with its latest policy, was focusing on cross-provincial travel needs, reaching out to the city of Langbrook for the first time and carefully launching the products “Shanghai to Lang Creek” and “Sunday Sun Ren Two Day Tours”, which were sold out less than a week after the launch.
Aunt Sun from Shanghai said that because of the epidemic, she has not been out this year.
“As soon as we saw a group tour, we went to our friends to sign up and never came to Lang Creek before and looked forward to the trip.” Aunt Sun said.
It is known that in September last year the city of Lang Creek signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Shanghai Railway International Tourism (GATT) Ltd. for the “Ride on High-Trail Creek” project, which envisages 12 trips of high-team tourism from Jiang Quan to Lang Creek within one year.
I hit myself in the face?
The White House consultant's "anti-bite" state is too early to go back to work.
It's too early for the White House advisors to come back to work in the "anti-bite" states.
On 23 July, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30 per cent of global cases.
For months, United States President Trump has repeatedly called on all states to resume their studies until recently, when he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, while his advisers “bite back” said that some state governments had resumed work prematurely.
At a press conference on 22 February, the White House presidential adviser, Kyliean Conway, stated that some state governments had failed to comply with the criteria for re-entry and had prematurely reopened places such as bars.
Conway also referred to earlier rumours that the President had “absolute power” to decide on the resumption of work in the states.
“The President is a federalist who believes in state autonomy.”
She defended Trump.
However, the rumours in Conway were presented by Trump himself at a White House outbreak briefing on 13 April.
This self-punishment was mocked by Internet users as a “rew history”.
Karen Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Gretchen Whitmer, Governor of Michigan, a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a stoppage of work.
Trump wants to push back to work so he can hold a rally.
It's not the first time Karen Conway's been controversial.
On April 15, Conway, in an interview with Fox News, said: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to have understood the word "19" as a version number that the netizens are madly narrating: reading newspapers without common sense!
The 3-year-olds were hit in the playground, and after they got paid, did they have a reason to sue the school?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Rule of Law Journal
The playground's been smashed, and the kids will be fined and they'll sue the school.
□ Correspondent, Zhao Yifan
When he was playing in a university playground, he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen of the softball team during the pitching.
After Chen's compensation, Mr. Man, his father, as his legal representative, brought the school before the court, asking for an apology from the school where the performance took place, and for payment of medical expenses, moral damages, etc., in the total amount of $20,000.
Recently, the People's Court of the Haidian District of Beijing, after considering the case, decided to dismiss the plaintiff's application on the basis of its finding that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, that it had fulfilled its duty to provide adequate safety and security, and that Chen Xiao had paid compensation.
Mr. Wen complained that during his summer vacation in 2019, he had taken Man to play in the school playground, where he was trained by the softball team.
In order to avoid the risks involved, Mr. Wen, Mr. Man and many other small friends and parents operate in safe areas designated by the softball team.
However, Chen, a softball team player, then left during the pitching, causing the softball to fly across the net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Little Man in the back of the brain.
Mr. Wen immediately took him to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with a head wound.
In Mr. Man's view, the school grounds facilities did not meet the relevant safety requirements and did not effectively manage the team and associated facilities.
The school's fault, which led to the above-mentioned incidents, caused great physical and psychological suffering and caused greater suffering to the family, is legally responsible.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a safety net on the playground and posted regulations, training notices informing it that entering the playground was required to be safe from the training site and to be mindful of its own safety, and that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the school “had failed in its duty of safety and security”.
The court considered that the university involved in the incident was open to the public free of charge and that while the school had a duty of safety and security in the management of the playground, such an obligation of security was sufficient only to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school had set up a safety net on the playground, had fulfilled its due security obligations, and Chen Hwa also compensated Siu Man for various losses, such as medical expenses and transportation costs, in accordance with an earlier compensation agreement, and the parties agreed to resolve the dispute once and for all.
Later on, the parents reiterated their claim for school compensation, and the court ruled against the plaintiff's application in its entirety.
Neither of the parties appealed the sentence, which is now in force.
Under article 37 of our Tort Liability Act, schools, as administrators of public places, have an obligation to ensure their safety and security; in cases where the actions of third persons result in harm to others, third persons are liable for torts and public places managers who fail to meet their obligation to ensure their safety and security are subject to complementary liability.
The judge stated that since it was most likely, as the administrator of a public place, to have an understanding of the actual situation in the place, to foresee possible dangers and damage, and thus to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of the loss or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the damage at the lowest cost, the law provided for a corresponding duty of protection for the performance of social activities.
In the present case, the obligation to ensure the safety and security of schools should be compatible with the social activities they are engaged in, in particular, the adoption of basic security measures and the duty to inform of hidden risks, in the case of people entering the playgrounds, which are open to the public free of charge.
Nor is it appropriate in judicial practice to impose excessive safety and security obligations on administrators of public places.
If the school has adopted a protective net and the obligation to inform is fulfilled, it may be held that the school is free of fault and is not legally liable.
In addition, in the case of third-party torts, even if the administrator of a public place, such as a school, fails to fulfil his duty of security, his liability is supplemented by damages, and under the recently promulgated Civil Code, the administrator may recover from the third person after assuming additional liability.
Therefore, in such an incident, the victim should not extend the scope of the claim after he or she has received compensation from the direct infringer.
In the normal course of epidemic prevention and control, the enthusiasm for physical fitness has increased.
With the gradual liberalization of cross-provincial tourism operations, the tourism market is about to recover.
On 21 July, Fujian Province resumed its trans-provincial tourism business, and the first weekend after opening, the Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, reached its peak.
The city of destination, which is a popular tourist destination, has a large number of visitors arriving at Xiamen on weekends.
The Xiamen railway station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer, while the flow of passengers at the airport is dominated by student, tourist and family visits.
The tourist market was gradually warming, with an average of 440 flights per day at Xiamen airport in July, and domestic flights having returned to 80 per cent of pre-occupancy flights.
Airlines have encrypted air speed lines from Xiamen to the main cities of Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming and Xian, taking over the recovered tourism market.
At present, a number of Xiamen's travel agencies are on-line for the summer season of cross-provincial domestic products, with team trips dominated by outdoor spots.
In response to summer passenger traffic peaks at railway stations and airports, additional personnel were deployed in areas where people could easily gather, such as duty counters and security corridors. Fujian also optimized the “eight-line health code” by sharing and sharing health data with 31 provinces and promoting an orderly revival of the tourism market.
Can Liu Qingyun “dismant” a new spark - Xinhuanet?
The Bomb Specialist 2 recently announced that it would be shown on 24 December as the first film to be scheduled for his first birthday.
The second is still the director of Qiu Litao, the producer and lead actor of Liu Dehua, with a brand-new story.
The inclusion of the second “nuclear bomb” element has also, it is known, made even more difficult by the challenges faced by the bomb-dismantling experts, which are already stunned by a few glimpses in the forecast, as well as by a huge explosion of mushroom clouds, and by a fire-spilled airport.
Three years ago, the bomb-breaking expert, made by the original teamman, was the winner of the five-and-one-barrel championship of the year and seven nominations for the Hong Kong Film and Image Award, and Qiulito Xu Dhua became the golden partner of the audience.
This bomb disposal specialist 2 is another source of hope for new sparks in the ace combination.
The Bomb Specialist 2 tells an entirely new story: the former bomb-dismantling expert, Pan Jae Feng (Lou Dehuahua), fainted at the scene of the explosion and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to turn to his fellow bomb-dismantling expert, Mr. Chew Wen (Yo Qing Yun-hyun).
The female inspector who was anxious to solve the case was also involved, along with Pan's ex-girlfriend, Pon-Ling.
It is still an expert in bomb demolition, but it can be seen from the slotting prognosis that Liu’s new role is complicated: he has broken a leg, wears prostheses, is being pursued by Liu Qingyun, who is also an expert in bomb demolition, and is being directed by his ex-girlfriend Nini.
What was the relationship between the three, what was being done by Lau Dewey at the Honolulu Hotel, what was involved in the case, and what was the twist of his career as a bomb cracker?

On 28 July 2019 local time, a great military parade was held in St. Petersburg, Russia, to celebrate the naval festival.
It was reported that Putin had congratulated the Navy officers on the day and had sailed by boat from the Gulf of Finland next to the ships that were about to take part in the naval parade, after which he had inspected the troops at the subjective altar.
Putin stated that the Russian naval fleet was equipped with state-of-the-art vessels and special equipment and that the level of equipment was constantly increasing.
On the Russian Navy Day parade, Putin said: “Russian naval fleets have high-precision-armed warships, strategic submarine cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, aircraft such as state-of-the-art aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment”.
On 24 June, local time, the Russian Red Field parade to commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the victory of the Patriotic War was held.
He also indicated that the Russian naval fleet would gain unique advantages through digitization and effective means of defence.
According to reports, the main naval parade to celebrate the Russian Navy Day was held in St. Petersburg and Karangstad, with the participation of 46 ships, including the frigate “Captain Kassatov”, the large anti-submarine vessel “Captain Kurakov”, as well as large landing ships, small missile ships, frigates, submarines, etc.
Of these, a series of ships performed a static display near the Winter Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg, the most notable of which was the cloned Russian first battleship, the Boltava, at the beginning of the eighteenth century.
In order to avoid the spread of the new coronary virus, only local residents and special guests were able to enter Karangstad during the Navy parade this year.
The last Sunday in July of each year is Russian Naval Day.

On 26 July, the Chongqing city development and reform committee in Chongqing (journalist Liu Xian) released a message stating that the city had, to date, retired 4404 fishermen, or 42.54 per cent of the total number of fishermen involved.
The 53-year-old Li Dynasty, in an interview with a Chinese news reporter, said that his grandfather had been fishing in Dragon Creek, and since he was 11 years old, he had been fishing with his father, shaking small boats, walking along the Dragon Creek River, going up to Chongqing Ping, going down to a long life, leaving home for 10 and a half days at a time to support his family.
Since 1997, however, as the rural population has gradually moved to the towns, the population of the towns has grown and environmental pollution has increased.
Paper mills, chemical plants, farms have been built along the Dragon Creek River, which also pollutes river water.
By 2007 and 2008, the River Dragon Creek became a stinking ditch.
"The scales caught are black, and they're black after they've been cut."
Li Dynasty said it was becoming more and more difficult to fish after the water had been polluted.
Local efforts have begun to combat the pollution of dragon streams, including drifting, rivering, water resource management, etc.
Li Dynasty also moved from fishing to production and became a member of the river patrol to protect aquatic resources.
With effect from 1 January 2020, a complete ban on fishing has been in place in Chongqing City's aquatic and related waters in the main city.
According to data from the Chongqing Municipal Development Reform Commission, to date, there have been a cumulative number of 3403 fishing vessels in Chongqing and 4,643 fishing vessels, representing 63.3 per cent and 86.3 per cent of the three-year total.
A total of 4404 fishermen, or 42.54 per cent of the total number involved, have been re-arrested.
Of the 4404 persons who returned, 4267 were employed, representing 96.89 per cent of those who retired.
Old-age insurance covers 2,691 persons, representing 61.10 per cent of the retired fishermen.
As a next step, the city of Chongqing will carry out intensive and specialized rehabilitation activities, speed up the clean-up and rehabilitation of the Yangtze River River Line, complete a new survey of riverine entry points and carry out corresponding remediation operations. The tasks of “triphosphorous” (i.e., phosphorous mines, phosphorists and phosphorus quarries) will be largely completed, the clean-up of small hydropower will be carried out, the reforestation of both sides of the Yangtze River will be promoted, the construction of green mines will be intensified, the illegal marinas of the Yangtze River Current and the illegal sand harvesting will be consolidated, and efforts will be intensified to prevent the capture and capture of retreats in the Yangtze basin.
Increased Israeli surveillance of recurrent outbreaks - new and emerging networks

Increased Israeli surveillance of recurrent outbreaks of disease
Early in the outbreak of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, Israel's control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on anti-control measures and the recent marked increase in the number of new coronary pneumonia cases in Israel, the Government of Israel has taken urgent measures on several occasions to strengthen the control of the epidemic.
On 28 February, the first case of new coronary pneumonia was diagnosed in Israel itself, prompting the closure of all ports of entry and exit, the suspension of non-essential trades, the conversion of schools to online instruction, restrictions on public transport and non-essential social activities, the closure of municipalities with severe epidemics, and joint military and police defence and control initiatives.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, with new cases of coronary pneumonia diagnosed in Israel falling to a single digits by mid-May.
As the epidemic is brought under control, Israel's anti-control measures have been completely lifted and the number of new confirmed cases of pneumonia has gradually rebounded since June.
The spread of the epidemic is accelerating, especially after July.
In recent days, Israel had more than 1,500 new cases per day for eight days, with 916 new cases as at 25 July.
As at 25 July, Israel had 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid resurgence of the epidemic, the Israeli Government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On 6 July, after more than 30,000 confirmed cases, the Government of Israel closed public entertainment facilities, such as gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars and nightclubs, and introduced a policy of restricting public transport to a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.
On 17 September, the Government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the “enclosed city” on weekends, which provided for the implementation of the “envelope city” between 5 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Fridays a week.
During this period, the population may go out, but places such as shops, shopping malls, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition galleries, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, meetings of more than 10 persons are prohibited on all dates and periods, places such as gymnasiums, studios, etc. are closed, restaurants and cafés are prohibited and take-out services are permitted only.
At the same time, the Israeli population has not paid sufficient attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and has not been able to join forces with the Government in the fight against it.
In the wake of repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people went to the streets to protest against the impact of the Government's preventive measures on their economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that the policy of combating the disease affected the economy.
In the evening of 21, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the residence of Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem to protest against the imposition by Prime Minister Netanyahu of preventive measures such as the ban on restaurants and cafés without commensurate compensation.
In addition, in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people do not comply with the requirement to wear masks in their outdoor activities, etc., and many people wear masks only on their chins or on their wrists.
During the repeated periods of the epidemic, schools were the worst affected by the spread of the new crown virus, and a recent visit to the kindergarten by journalists found that neither kindergarten teachers nor students were wearing masks as required by the Government, nor were they able to maintain a two-metre safe social distance from each other, burying a large number of teachers and students with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the National Security Council's expert advisory mission to counter the epidemic, argued that Israel was moving towards a “dangerous situation”, noting that the current measures taken by Israel to prevent and control the epidemic were insufficient and that all recreational and recreational venues and summer schools should be closed in order to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman stated that Israel lacked an overall plan to combat the epidemic and that Parliament and government departments should move away from their respective interests as soon as possible and reach agreement on the fight against the epidemic, with clear steps to include relevant restrictions in different sectors.

The farmers of Ningxia Siuhara, Wu Feng Fong, were no longer able to live with their old friends in Tianfu, and two people were driven from their homes 20 miles away to the Liang Yun cultural compound.
Despite these two years of difficult legs, the 77-year-old Dai Tinfu looks forward to “a stop-and-go” approach.
This is a small courtyard in the former part of the town where, unlike the usual farmyards, there is often a popular Qin cavity in the courtyard, as well as a great variety of skin shows, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavities, browsing plays, etc.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began planning for the construction of a cultural compound by his loved ones.
With the cultural compound of Liang Yun, the cultural life of the villagers has been enriched.
The journalist has not yet entered the Liang Yun cultural compound and the tune of the Qin cavity has been spread.
The Qin cavity band is being played for the villagers and is being played by the villagers of the neighbouring village, Priscilla.
She has been in love with Qin since childhood and is now well known on the ground, and as long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Priscilla played live on the Internet.
"It's a very happy thing to have a stage where more people can see their own performances."
On the stage, the singers look one at the other, the players sing one tune, but the enthusiasm, though amateurs, does not diminish at all.
Like the pristine style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin cavity, the “root-root” art and non-relict culture of the Qin cultural compound comes to the fore.
The compound also contains over 300 items of agricultural tools, traditional and hand-made tiles, paper clippings, embroidery, leather shadow, etc., over a period of time.
Leung Yun led journalists into the courtyard where he displayed his collection of old objects, old kettles, trichords, swirling cars, etc.
Why would a common farmer build a cultural compound?
"Skin movies are my family art, and I've studied it since I was 15 years old."
The Liang Yun Cultural Complex was established in 2012 as the first rural “Intangible Cultural Heritage Museum” in Ningxia and as a model compound for the conservation of Intangible Cultural Heritage in the sequestered city.
In addition to the Liang Yun cultural compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in the former prefectures of the established city, including more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as the Shenjiang River cultural compound, the Wang Yonghong cultural compound and the Yangroon cultural compound, covering the towns and streets of the former district, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grass-roots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the people and satisfying their spiritual needs.
“As life grows better and better, traditional culture cannot be left behind.”
Xinhua Network has come back to Winners to watch the Xinhua Network of Li Li's rivals.
On July 16th, the 40th episode of "The Winner" will be launched on the Beijing Watch.
The Winner was adapted from real history and was drawn from the Soviet military archives, which had been sealed for many years and had been in existence for the first time.
Actor Liu Yunlong, who is well known to his audience for the “fiction play”, has broken the image of the play and challenged a popular “stutter agent”.
In recent years, the success of dramas such as " Masks ", " kites ", etc., has proved the vitality of quiz-type plays.
Unlike previous quiz, Winning looks at the world and extends the story beyond its background to the Soviet battlefields of the Far East.
In the context of the final phase of the 1944 war against Japan, it tells the story of Tang Fei, a Chinese Communist Party secret intelligence worker (Liu Yunlong), who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Chinese Underground Party Committee for Lin River Province and the head of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carried out the “Mudanula” plot of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In a number of charades, the male lead, as a top spy, appeared to be a handsome, highly intelligent, mature and perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not fit to spy, “The spy is the kind of person who can't find anything in the crowd, and if he's out there, he's the one who's very handsome, and everyone has to pay attention to you, he can't hide.” There's a line in the kite that says, “If you don't come after me, I forget that I'm a nationalist,” and the spy's going to be elitist.
So, in Winning, Liu Yunlong was determined to design his character, Tang Fei, as a “stutter agent” with a sense of joy.
The other side of " Winning " was supported by the head of the police department Fukuhara, a Japanese actor, and Fong Shibao, a Lee.
One north and one south, the two elites, added to the whole play a number of great points of view.
Directed by the word "joke" to describe Li Li Li's and Liu Yunlong's rivals in the play, "It's definitely a tremor, and they're both very close to me, and it's very powerful for me. They're often ‘shows’, for example, when we write half a page of paper, and if I don't stop filming, they'll be able to do it all the time."
It is not only from the point of view of the characters, but also from the point of view of the audience, that when the actors are in the role and ensure that their characters are in the position of their characters, it is more likely to be seen.
There is also a familiar face in many of the “Kills of Willows” and the famous “F4” of Mountain City, which is famous in kite, has gathered three in Winning.
He played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jane's Huo and Liu Myung Yang, and this time he played Tang Fei's right arm.
Directed by Infei, the director said, "These two people have no faults, and they just follow the waves in that time and in that environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We need to be human. This is the feeling that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we have to develop them, and our teams will grow."
The end of the play for both of them was also carefully designed, and he was confident that a satisfactory response would be given to the audience.

Xinhua Society Hong Kong On July 25, the Director of Finance and Treasury of the HKSAR Government, Xu Jung-woo, stated that Hong Kong's financial markets remained active and functioning in an orderly manner.
He was optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
At an online seminar organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Congress Chamber of Commerce (Congregation Canada) on 24 (Toronto time), he said that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation as a result of the “repair of windwaves” and the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
Hong Kong dollar exchange rates are stable and tend to favour strong exchange guarantee levels.
The banking system showed no clear signs of outflows; on the contrary, more than $11 billion had been received since June.
Total bank deposits have also continued to increase over the past few months, with a series of open equity fund-raising activities in the stock market, which have been on the rise.
According to Xu Jung-woo, the new coronary pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's fundamental advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has a number of advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and a simple low-tax system, which keeps Hong Kong at the forefront of international financial centres.
According to Xu Jung-woo, the HKSAR Government has set aside HK$ 6 billion from the “Physics Control Fund” to create some 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering persons with different skills and qualifications.
In order to support the development of financial science and technology, the HKSAR Government has also launched the “One Thousand People's Scheme” to finance local financial technology companies, start-ups and other businesses with financial science and technology-related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talent and enrich Hong Kong's pool of financial science and technology talent.
Looking ahead, Jung-woo Xu is optimistic about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to use the advantages of Hong Kong and its status as an international financial centre, an international asset and wealth management centre and a global offshore renminbi business hub for development and investment in and around the Australasia Bay region of Hong Kong.
The Lancet published praises China's anti-epidemic efforts and encourages countries to learn from their experiences.
According to the Journal 25 of The Lancet, China, a country with 1.4 billion people of similar size to Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage without further widespread transmission and has largely controlled the epidemic in the country.
According to the article, over a decade or so, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, making it much more prepared for the new crown than for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of that year.
The author states that, at the time of the 2002 SARS outbreak, China was initially ill-prepared, and in particular the pathogens could not be identified.
When the new coronary virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and to share genome sequencing data with the international community on 11 January 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had articulated the clinical characteristics of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the new coronary virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research and, in the event of a state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, conducted very rapidly and strictly. In May and July, respectively, the results of the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published in the Lancet.
China's experience had shown that it was important to invest in national health and research systems and to improve laboratory capacity effectively.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, in particular low- and middle-income countries, are highly worthy of learning and learning.
Moreover, China's experience has shown that, on the basis of strong research, strong high-level determination to rely on scientific evidence for sound decision-making is essential if the new crown epidemic is to be brought under effective control.
The article stressed the need for Governments and their leaders to respect science, understand its value and act on it in the most socially beneficial manner.
In the early days of the outbreak, the Chinese National Guard appointed three teams of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus. Their recommendations provided the basis for the decision of 23 January to “sequete” Wuhan; when experts raised the need and urgency for the construction of the quadrant hospital, the Government took the decision and implemented it quickly; and, at the same time, the broad participation of the community and the population made it possible to control the epidemic quickly and effectively.
The article concluded by highlighting the need for countries to strengthen global cooperation and joint responses to global health emergencies.

On 18 July, at the twenty-third Shanghai International Film Festival, the official list of selected films for the Golden Prize was published.
The first real-life film by Da Peng, " Happiness ", was successfully included in the film festival's Golden Title Award, and the film's first poster was officially released.
Posters, table charts.
The film " Happily " was the first realism by Da Peng's director and was the second link between him and the Golden Lord's Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who came back to his hometown in the north-eastern countryside with an unexpected vision of how to make a family into a literary film in the middle of the year, resulting in a series of accidents.
Family members gathered for the film completed the final party.
In today’s film poster, one of the members of the family, Wang Xiangxiang, sits in the center of the picture and smokes in the background of the black land of the northeast in silver, with the prospect of a red light cage that Chinese people must hang for their holidays.
The huge contrast between the happy, reunified red lamphouse and the mirage of kings seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement of this extended family relationship.
According to the information received, apart from the fact that the daughter of Wang Xiang Xiang was played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the film was performed by the real director's family. The video's experimental audio-visual style broke the boundaries between drama and reality and gave the audience a new immersion experience.
According to the director Da Peng, the creation of Good Will was the result of a series of sudden changes in the family during the film, which forced the original project to change, and life without a script was eventually recorded as a film, but released the power beyond design.
How does director Da Peng deal with this "behavior" and how can he continue to respond to the changes brought about by it?
There is no doubt that Happiness is an experimental, almost universal, audio-visual style that transforms life in front of the camera into a film, and that, wrapped in real images, the viewers will find themselves and their family's shadow from the family that the film presents, in which a series of reflections will take place as the family gathering ends.

Bartoukang post, with Yu Wang and a soldier on duty.
Ten degrees below the average temperature of the year, a row of simple barracks standing at the mountain entrance, with a flag swarming not far away, soldiers on duty every day in the wind, and regular patrols to higher-altitude locations.
The fighters climbed the steep slopes of the rocks and needed both hands and feet.
It was late in July, at a time when the low-altitude areas were full of grass, while the relatively dense greenness was found only in the trenches behind the barracks in Baldukang.
The soldiers at the post, who had been stationed for six years, said that this was their backyard and that only in July and August of each year could we see the grass slowly growing and, shortly thereafter, all turned yellow and covered by snow.
It may take about nine hours to patrol on foot.
In the harsh highland environment, the soldiers who are stationed here are often accompanied by snow and glaciers, and they are also required to patrol the higher ends of the mountain on a regular basis.
Today, a patrol consisting of eight soldiers, led by mentor Yo-Hin Liang, took the patrol road again.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds and moves towards the target in the morning.
On the way, one of the soldiers was renegade, and the comrades were urgently rescued.
In addition to the patrol tasks, the soldiers at the Badukon outpost are required to conduct daily tactical and physical training.
The passage of time, the rising altitude, the decreasing oxygen content and the constant overstretching of strength test the will of the patrol personnel.
They gnawed their teeth and crossed a number of landslide points, as well as several flashpoints.
At 1600 hours, during lunch hours, the patrol crews brought their own dry food and sat at an altitude of more than 5700 metres above sea level, accompanied by rain and snow and supplemented their strength with food.
The soldiers at the Bartoukang post conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they play cards together and losers do push-ups, both entertaining and physical exercise.
After a brief break from the cold wind, they climbed up to the target point of the patrol and took the flag out at the entrance to the hill, making a solemn declaration.
Behind them is Mount Marmash, which lies dozens of kilometres of uninhabited land, and which is the safest guardian of the country's gates.
Beijing Consumption Season Restart - Xinhua Network
Beijing City relaunched its consumption season activities in accordance with the principle of “a comprehensive renewal, focused planning, orderly advancement and organization”.
On 26 July, 1.5 million coupons were issued, including 1 million off-line food coupons and 500,000 smart product coupons, which consumers could receive from APP in Kyoto.
The Deputy Director-General of the Beijing City Business Bureau, Liu Mei Ying, presented at a media conference held in Beijing on the need to further reduce business matching during the restarted consumer season on the basis of maintaining the existing voucher card pack subsidy.
Starting in early August, the current 1:1 government and enterprise allocation was adjusted to 2:1, for example, when consumers received a card package to the shop, and received a 120-dollar discount, of which the Government subsidized $60, the business concession $60, the government subsidy $80, and the business concession $40.
During the consumption season, three major operators will subsidize flows and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting 5G new capital and 5G new consumption in Beijing.
Chen Mau Bo says that Hong Kong's economy has been hit by another outbreak.
On 26 July, the Chief Finance Officer of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region stated that Hong Kong had been hit by a new wave of neo-crowd pneumonia, as well as by commercial and economic activity, which had seen a slight recovery.
The HKSAR Government once again calls on all large and small owners to reduce their rents and to work with retail traders, food producers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
On the same day, Chen Maobo published an article on the Internet entitled " The Road to Colossal Recovery ".
He stated that the recent high number of cases of new coronary pneumonia diagnosis in Hong Kong and the critical situation had affected the lives of the population and affected the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the primary priority is to prevent cases from being imported and to treat and disrupt the transmission chain as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is under control, economic activity should be resumed in due course.
He noted that, in the face of a new wave of epidemic shocks, commercial exchanges and economic activities, which had seen a slight recovery, had also been hit.
In addition to the contractual spirit, social responsibility is equally important for the business community, especially those groups that receive substantial government subsidies under the Employment Guarantee Scheme.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong remained critical in the second quarter of this year, but that the contraction appeared to have slowed slightly.
On the export side, he considered that the external situation in Hong Kong remained critical.
According to Chen Maobo, the development history of Hong Kong over the past decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
The biggest earthquake in Taiwan's eastern sea this year - the new Chinese net.
On July 26, at 2052 hours, in the eastern waters of Taiwan, there was an earthquake of the size of the Richter scale, with a maximum seismic level of 4 and a full-scale shock, the biggest earthquake this year.
The Taiwan Meteorological Department reports that the earthquake struck 86.5 km south-east of the Illan County Government, i.e., the eastern sea of Taiwan, with a depth of 53 km.
China's seismic network measured the earthquake to 5.5 degrees.
The biggest shocks across the entire region are: level 4 in Hualian County, level 3 in Yilan County, Taidong County, Nanzhou County and Yunlin County, and levels 1 to 2 in other counties and municipalities.
According to the Taiwan Meteorological Department, the earthquake, the largest in the entire region since this year, was a hidden earthquake at the boundary of the plate, with earthquakes occurring frequently in the past and active since this year.
Aftershocks of a scale greater than level 4 will not be excluded in the coming week.
Marinichev said that the change in value was influenced by the devaluation of the rubles and the epidemic.
He said, “The cost of services is increasing.
As a result of the epidemic, people are beginning to spend more time on the Internet.”
Malinichev did not rule out a significant annual increase in Internet prices, arguing that operators could provide customers with higher speed and more services to offset the dissatisfaction with price increases.
"The Chinese Doctor" is a tribute to Xinhua Network, an anti-epidemic hero.
In recent days, with the respect of Chinese filmmen in the fight against the hero of the disease, the director of the Bona Film Group, Liu Weiqiang (Tutt), who is the director of the film group, held a talk in Guangzhou with a member of the courtyard of Chungnanshan on the production of the anti-epidemic film " Chinese Doctors ".
The Bona Film industry wishes to pay tribute to the Chinese Doctors for all medical and vaccination workers who fought on the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be presented as a national film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
Currently, the Bona Film industry is being deployed under the arrangements of the Chinese Ministry and the National Film Bureau, with the support of the Guangdong Province Film Bureau and the Hubei Province Film Bureau, to organize a film entitled " Chinese Doctors ", prepared by the original crew of the film " China Captain ", a film that is reflected in the strong leadership of the Party and the unity of the people of the country in the fight against the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on Wuhan's anti-epidemic front, using the background of Wuhan medical personnel and provincial and city rescue teams, unique narratives, as well as a powerful lens language, from a human point of view, and presents a moving story about Chinese medical personnel who are dedicated and sacrificed on the front line of the anti-epidemic.
It is known that in the first days of the day of the release of Wuhan, the Bona company overcomes its difficulties by sending a filming team deep into the epidemic, exchanging information and gathering information with hundreds of health-care workers in front of each other, and that a large number of valuable first-hand video materials have been taken by white angels on the frontlines of the anti-epidemic front, including the Choon Namsan Monastery, Guangzhou and Wuhan First Man, and Guangdong Oo medical teams, as well as the Wuhan Jindong Hospital, Wuhan and the hospitals, Wuhan University Central Hospital and the Wuhan Central Hospital.
During the symposium, Mr. Chung Nansan also raised expectations and hopes for film production: “I look forward to seeing not only some of the more visible experts, but also more of the medical staff who work on the front line, who are the majority.”
He stated that he had previously read " Me and My Fatherland ", " China's Captain ", and believed that it would be good to tell the story of the big picture from the perspective of ordinary people.
“Some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China.”
Referring to the distribution of the film, Mr. Chung Nanshan said that some outside the country now prefer to put the virus on a politicized label and that he hoped that the film would impress the audience from a human point of view: “This film, in addition to being shown in China, should also be shown abroad, in a way that is understandable to both domestic and international audiences, and in a true human spirit”.
Mr. Chung Nansan also recalled the film Man to Middle Ages of the 1980s, “Those years have passed, and I was most impressed with the film after the reforms were opened by Man to Middle Ages, when my friends from abroad cried, and it would be amazing if the Chinese Doctor could do that”.
According to Mr. Chung Namshan, it would have been very successful if the Chinese Doctors had been resonant with foreign audiences.
During the conversation, Mr. Chung Nansan also shared his opinion and recommendations on the current international epidemic, “I believe that people are always smarter than the virus”.
According to Mr. Chung Nansan, although the virus is difficult to predict, humans have so far been at great risk in primitive societies, where modern societies have developed medical technologies and social management measures, coupled with a basic understanding of science in the face of the new crown pneumonia epidemic among medical personnel and even among ordinary people around the world, so that people are no longer as passive as they used to be, “the next step is to look into two areas, one is to look at how the world can strengthen cooperation and the other is to focus on healing people's minds.”

On 25 July, the Hunan Red Tourism Cultural Festival of 2020 was opened in Kishan.
As one of the main events, the first Red Industry Fair was held at the Global Tourism Advisory Centre in Sasayama.
The exhibition area is full of red and original literature products, and the revolutionary old area earth products, among others, have attracted tourists from various parts of the country to compete for their purchase.
“The Red Games are both a demonstration of the achievements of the national red cultural industry and an important platform for the sharing of experiences and the exploration of development paths among exhibitors and enterprises.”
The director of the Executive Committee of the first Red Games described the Red Games, under the theme “Handing the red culture to warmer”, with a total exhibition area of nearly 3,000 square metres, and the creation of an atmosphere-building area, an exhibition area, and a web site for the Red Literary Network.
A total of 768 exhibits, including red artifacts, handicrafts, special food products, tourist routes, red training courses, red original products, etc., were displayed in 137 enterprises and units in eight out-of-country municipalities, including Zhejiang Ka Shing, Guizhou, Yuyang and Xingzhou, as well as my Governor.
The exhibition area will be on display until 29 July.
As the host of the Red Ribbon, the exhibition area has featured prominently.
The director of the exhibition area described the division between the red industry and the development of the red cultural industry.
The Red Industry Fair displays 31 exhibits from six enterprises, including Wallithlite steel, Wallithine cable and thorium power, and the Red Cultural Industry Development Fair displays nearly 200 copies of 27 individual products, including the Red Book series, the Red Food series, and the Red Book creation products.
In the Yanyan area, a number of tourists were attracted to displays of flower handicrafts and paper-cutting works of art.
The exhibition, presented by the Director of the Yanan City Department of Culture and Tourism, Madongpo, carefully selected the excellent red original product of Yanan in the last two years, 16 of which were excellent works of the 2019 national red original product.
At the same time, they invited the National Intangible Cultural Heritage Conservation Project “Anse Scissors”, “Shang Bei Min Song” and the provincial non-residual project “Yanchuan Bus” to carry out a campaign focusing on the Yanan folklore specialty products, and took the opportunity to interact with other exhibitors and promote cross-regional cooperation.
The cumulative number of new cases diagnosed in Japan is over 30,000 - Xinhuanet
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on 26 days, and more than 200 new cases per day for six days, bringing the total to 11214.
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases were reported in Osaka, 90 in Fukuoka and 80 in Aichi.
Telecommunication network fraud increased by 70% in the first half of the year.
According to the website of the Supreme Inspectorate, in the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service prosecuted 58101 persons for fraud, a 35 per cent increase over the same period.
In particular, the number of fraud-related offences is high, and the number of fraud-related offences prosecuted by the Public Prosecution Service accounts for 43.4 per cent of the total number of fraud-related offences.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has provided targeted guidance, and a total of nine cases involving fraud have been published in 10 typical cases involving the prevention and control of the epidemic.
In the case of the prosecution service in the first half of the year, there were numerous cases of fraud, ranging from high-profile to national macro-policies, down to low-cost housing for the population, including epidemic-related fraud, “medical-care” fraud, “health-care” fraud, “job-seeking” fraud, “routing” fraud, State-subsidized fraud, national asset unfrozen fraud, etc., which continued to be “new” in areas such as education, health care, employment, old age, social security, land evictions, precision poverty alleviation and financial credit, causing not only economic losses to victims, but also serious economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds transcend national borders, geographical and human constraints and have features such as crowding, cross-border, remote, electronic payments, and are not specific to specific groups of victims and are highly harmful.
For example, it is more confusing to set up specialized companies, rent high-end writing buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legitimate web platforms to promote, recruit, train and test recruiters, manage business models and wear “legitimate coats”.
It is incumbent upon the Public Prosecutor's Office to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to provide prompt warning to the public and the relevant authorities.
In the case of the judiciary, the Public Prosecution Service takes seriously its duties, maintaining a high level of pressure on fraud offences, while tailoring law enforcement initiatives to promote social governance through, inter alia, the issuance of prosecutorial recommendations.
The Public Prosecutor's Office has strictly restricted the factual, evidentiary, procedural and legal application of arrest and prosecution of fraud cases to the facts and to the law.
In particular, in the case of telecommunication network fraud, the focus is on the central role of electronic data in fact-finding, and efforts are made to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence that is cross-substantiated.
For example, in the case of disease-related fraud handled by the Ningbo District Public Prosecutor's Office in Zhejiang province, the first intervention by the Public Prosecutor's Office, from the time of the incident to the end of the case, took only five days, reflecting the attitude and determination to proceed quickly and maintain stability in society.
During the review of arrests and prosecutions, attention was paid to the prosecution of those who had missed their case, to correct the failure of the public security organs to arrest 733 persons and to review and prosecute 1,113 co-perpetrators.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecution Service issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations on fraud, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud and promote deeper governance.
For example, in response to the shortcomings found in the telecommunications network, such as communications enterprises, banks and intermediaries, the Prosecutor's Office of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, and the Prosecutor's Office of Dong Jing City, have issued timely recommendations urging the relevant authorities to strengthen their monitoring mechanisms and improve the effectiveness of the system.
The fourth is to do everything in its power to recover the damage.
The local procuratorial authorities have seized on important points such as involvement in the investigation, leading the evidence and examining the prosecution, and have urged the investigating authorities to actively pursue the recovery of the proceeds, to cooperate with the relevant authorities in their efforts to minimize the economic damage caused to the population by the crime of fraud.
For example, in the case of a loan set in Lin, a case involving 22 estates awaiting seizure, the first of which was the issuance of a stay of execution letter in cases where the property might have been pre-empted in other cases, was sent to the relevant court in a timely manner. It was recommended that the court should suspend the property in question until the facts of the crime had been established and that it should be dealt with in a unified manner, with a view to making the best efforts to recover the property in question and to recover the damage suffered by the victims.
The Prosecutor reminds everyone of the need to be vigilant with regard to fraud, not to expect to “drop the pie” in the sky, nor to believe in what is cheap and keep their “money bags”.
Quinning County, Guizhou: The apple tree is short, the way out of poverty - the new middle net.
Source: China Economic Network.
Inflamed by the heat of the summer, the daily Economic Journal-China Economic Network journalist walked into the town of Jina, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
In the face of the sun, the villagers, Li Yuanzhong, groved grass in the base and, despite the redness of their faces, sung a few little songs from time to time in their mouths.
In Weining County, where the town is located, because of low latitudes, high altitude, sufficient light, great day and night temperatures, high sugar and good taste of apples produced, and some visibility in the surrounding area, it has not been able to sell a good price, nor has it been able to form an industry.
The town was once a poor town with a “spring and fall” with a high incidence of 25.8 per cent of local poverty 10 years ago.
During the critical period of the fight against poverty into a decisive victory, it is urgent to change traditional cultivation practices, restructure the industry and increase the incomes of farmers.
After a number of visits, Chen Tai and a group of people from the town were of the view that industrial development could no longer follow the same path.
To that end, the town of Chennai has introduced a leading enterprise to grow apples in a modern way.
The Deputy General Manager of Winning Beyond Agriculture Ltd., Hu Jianwen, in 2015, came to the town of Tsangxi to study the local conditions of cultivation, starting in 2016 with the local planting of apple trees.
At first, when the village mobilized Li Yuanzheng to turn the land out to plant apple trees, the couple made a sound in their hearts: "You have grown apples for so many years, and you can't see who grows apples in the village is rich."
"All the apples grown are short apples, and they don't grow too tall."
What happened to Lee Won-chung was that this apple crop was based on a new method, with irrigation pipes under every apple tree, water and fertilizer poured on the roots, and when the fruit was collected in the fall, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and was able to pick the fruit on its feet.
At present, the Apple Base is gradually entering productive life, and the market, as Hu Jianwen had anticipated, is not unchallenged and is very popular with consumers in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has brought about a new change in Li's life and, while still growing land, new sources of income have emerged.
Nine acres of land flow from the Li Yuanzheng family to the Apple Base, and each year, in addition to the land transfer fee on the bottom, there is a profit bonus after the hanging fruit, and the couple usually work in the base, “one person gets $80 a day and has work every year”.
Mr. Lee told the press that the profits of the past year had been more than 2,800 dollars, plus the transfer of land and the couple's wages, and that the family had more than 80,000 dollars.
"Acre apples produce more than 15,000 yuan per year, about 10 times the value of maize grown."
Mr. Chen has told journalists that the entire town has now planted 20,000 acres of apples, 6,000 acres in Central China Village alone, covering 4056 families and 17.2 million people in rural areas, including 656 families and 2952 poor families, who are covered by stub cards, and whose wages exceed 6 million yuan a year, making it possible for the base to be built in front of their homes and not to go out to work.
Li Yuan Trung, whose pocket is growing, has also begun to realize his own wish.
On the spring of this year, Li wonzheng bought a Land Cruiser, as he drove off from work today, “the family has more than a dozen acres of land, and when the next apple base expands, the flow goes to them, and the income is even greater”.

The membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect" - the new grid in the middle.
The membrane separation technology helps to decipher the “greenhouse effect”
A map of the new hybrid membrane preparation technology
Reporter Swe reported that the atmosphere environment and bioenergy team at Tianjin University had made significant progress towards “dimensional separation techniques for carbon dioxide capture” and had succeeded in developing new technologies for hybrid membrane preparation to significantly enhance the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The results were published as a cover article of the international journal Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
“The greenhouse effect” is a major environmental problem that afflicts human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the cause of the “greenhouse effect”.
The efficient capture and utilization of human carbon dioxide emissions is the focus of scientists'attention.
“Membrane separation” is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology that separates carbon dioxide gases with the help of membrane materials and is characterized by efficient energy efficiency and simple operation.
How to “breath deep breaths” of membrane material and increase the efficiency of gas separation is a bottleneck in the use of membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide.
The scientific team at Tianjin University has developed innovative ideas to explore the effects of different solvents on the separability of membrane gases through repeated experiments.
The results of the experiment showed that the use of N-methamphetamine as a pre-positioned solvent resulted in a more even distribution of carbon nanotubes in the membrane material and “breathing more air” that effectively increased the efficiency and rate of gas separation of the membrane material.
With this new technology, mixed matrix membrane, CO2 separability is close to the current theoretical separation cap for this type of membrane material.
“New technologies provide new ideas for membrane separation techniques to capture carbon dioxide.”
Li Yun, a member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team at Tianjin University, stated: “We hope that this technology will provide strong support to future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in dealing with flue gas and will play a significant role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions, among other things”.
Before volunteering, find out what a professional is-- a new network.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning newspaper
Before volunteering, you'll have to figure out what a professional is.
Each year, students or parents report to the NCC because they are not aware of the terminology involved in the voluntary filing, which in turn affects the voluntary filing.
This year, the Beijing Transport University, the Beijing University of Science and Technology, the Beijing Post and Telecommunications University, the Beijing Forestry University, the Beijing Chemical University and five higher schools jointly launched a 2020 admission policy to eliminate professional differentials.
What is the significance of professional underperformance in voluntary filings?
There are three ways of assigning a profession.
Experts cautioned that before volunteering, it was important to have a detailed reading of the Statute of Admission to Heart School and to have an understanding of the rules governing admission to higher education, including the percentage of placements, the rules for the allocation of professions, etc.
The rules for the assignment of specialties refer to the three main forms of professional priority, merit priority and professional differentials for admission to the profession after a post-secondary grade.
The specific modalities used by universities will be specified in the Statute of Admissions.
However, there are also some institutions of higher education where the principle of overall priority is given, with no difference in level between specializations.
This means that candidates within the range of admission are queued on the basis of the total score, and when the score does not reach the first professional voluntary entry score line, it depends on whether the second professional voluntary entry score line is reached, and so on until the last professional volunteer is admitted, with no difference in rank between professional volunteers.
The so-called “professional difference” is the value of one or more of the points published in the admission charters for the selection of candidates for the different specializations, which is the “professional gap”.
That is to say, the difference in the scores of students enrolled in the colleges in the first and non-first professions, and the difference in the grades among the various professions, e.g., 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
It is assumed that Ming, a student, will take a 560-point course in higher education: computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, and that the admission of students to higher education A will be based on a professional grade differential of 2 points, 1 point, 1 point and 0 points.
In the case of professional assignments, if the junior professional volunteer meets the requirements for professional admission and has a planned professional balance, the junior professional is admitted to the “computer” profession; if the computer is not accepted, his score is subtracted by two points, ranking 558 points as candidates for the “international trade” examination of the first professional volunteer, determining whether the qualification is met; if it is still not met, the third professional voluntary “automated” entry is reduced by one point (i.e., 557); if it is still not met, the next professional entry is reduced by one point (i.e., 556) for the fourth professional, and if it is still unable to meet its professional volunteering, no less, and so on.
Different university-level differentials.
With the spread of parallel volunteering, many higher education institutions have now eliminated their professional grades, but some of them have retained this method this year, with more than 20 universities having established their professional grades, according to the Charter of Admissions published by the respective schools.
For example, the Sichuan University of Agriculture, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Teacher University, Chengdu Medical School, Northeast Electric University, American University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Industrial University, Ningxia University, Shandong Technical University, Chinese Institute of Civil Aviation Flight, etc.
In these universities, the professional differentials are different for each university.
Some institutions of higher education have a grade difference in each field, such as the University of Ningxia, where the files have been sent to candidates, in order of reduction of one point in the order in which candidates report their professional volunteers.
Some universities, on the other hand, set different levels of specialization between different specializations.
For example, at the University of the United States of America, the total margin for professional volunteer grades is 4 points, i.e. 3 points for first-professional volunteers and 3 points for other professional volunteers, no grade differentials between other professional volunteers, which are considered to be parallel voluntary, and 1 point for other professional and transfer professional volunteers.
When volunteering, candidates and parents must take a careful look at the admission policies of the schools they report, see if there are any differences in specialization, what the forms of differences are, and, while taking the scores fully into account, make a sound analysis of the schools and professions to be selected. If the admission rules of the institutions are explicitly based on differential grades, when selecting a profession, the candidates must pay attention to the gradient between the professions and increase the rate of admission.

The first Atlantic hurricane this year landed in Texas, where the epidemic hit hard.
The National Hurricane Center of the United States announced in the morning that Hurricane Hanna had reached 145 kilometres per hour and was expected to cause heavy rains in southern Texas and north-eastern Mexico until Monday, which in turn would cause rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual movement towards land, customs have been reduced and, despite local power outages, there have been no reports of casualties.
Some local officials in Texas are preparing to deal with tornadoes that are likely to occur in the coastal zone.
On Twitter, President Trump stated that the Office was closely monitoring the dynamics of Hurricanes Hanna and Douglas in Hawaii and called on the population to listen to the emergency management information of the local Government and to protect families and property.
At the same time, the state of Texas's new crown epidemic is rapidly worsening, with a rising number of infections, with a cumulatively more than 390,000 confirmed infections and over 5,000 deaths.
In the wake of this hurricane, the Government will face the twin challenges of sheltering the homeless while preventing a further deterioration of the epidemic.
For the first time, an ad hoc committee was set up to sign a “long draft” for the third World Expo Alliance to build the “Introduction Links” - Xinhua Network.
The first meeting of the Alliance of Exhibitors of the Third Expo was filmed in Shanghai on 26 July.
On 26 July in Shanghai, Xinhua, Xinhua society (journalist Zhou Ri), for the first time a professional committee was set up by the Union of Participants in the Third Import Exposition, the first of which included the Special Commission on Public Health against Physics and the Special Commission on Breastfeeding, and 35 member enterprises signed a three-year memorandum of cooperation on long-term participation in the exhibition.
At the first meeting of the Alliance of Participants at the Third Expo, held on 26 June, a three-year long-term memorandum of cooperation was signed by a group of exhibition members, such as the South Korean modernity, the United States Tau Congregation, the Japanese Academy of Capital Sciences, New Zealand New Zealand, Siemens, France, Michelin, and Aslicom, United Kingdom, and the revised and refined Charter of the Alliance was also published for the first time.
The opening ceremony of the Specialized Breast Industry Committee was filmed in Shanghai on 26 July.
According to the latest constitution, the Alliance will introduce a lead unit rotation mechanism to enhance the functioning of the Commission.
The Panel will make recommendations for the analysis of sectoral trends to promote the sustainable development of the industry.
At the same time, the consolidation of industry-wide chain resources, in large numbers and small sizes, will lead to the emergence of associated enterprises and will make the Expo a high place for industry enterprises to gather.
The establishment for the first time of the Special Commission on Public Health Prevention and Control is particularly important in the fight against the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
As Vice-President of the Public Health Commission of the Third Expo, Jianping, General Manager of the Rapidly Diagnostic Operations of the Greater Central China District, said that, as a next step, APEC would join forces with more industry partners to explore new solutions and cooperation models to help China and the world fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The inauguration of the Specialized Committee on Public Health Prevention was filmed in Shanghai on 26 July.
According to the information received, for the first time, the third Expo established a public health quarantine zone and, to date, nearly 50 global enterprises have signed up for exhibitions with an exhibition area of over 10,000 square metres.
During the first Expo in 2018, the Alliance of Expo Participants was set up by a voluntary initiative of the exhibitors to serve as a platform for high-quality business exchange and cooperation, a platform for information- and resource-sharing among participating parties, and a think tank for promoting trade and commerce and development between China and the countries of the world (regions).
To date, 142 enterprises have joined the exhibitors'alliance, covering 23 countries and regions around the world.
Three-year-old Belgian girl died of new coronary virus infection - Xinhuanet
The Belgian health sector stated on 24 that a 3-year-old girl died from a new coronary virus infection, the country's youngest new coronary disease.
The Belgian spokesperson for the health sector, Boudwin Caterri, said that the girl had already suffered from other serious diseases prior to contracting the new coronary virus; in addition to the girl, an 18-year-old had recently died from the new coronary virus.
According to Katri, 85 per cent of new patients in Belgium last week were under the age of 60.
He reminds people who are healthy and younger that they should not be taken lightly.
“Although it is rare for young people to die of new coronary virus infection, no one is immune now.”
Last week, the number of new cases diagnosed in Belgium rose by 89 per cent compared to the previous week, with an average of 2.9 deaths per day from new coronary virus infections, up from 1.7 per day in the previous week.
During the peak of the European epidemic, the Belgian population accounted for “the highest number” of new coronary infections in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
According to the latest data, a total of 64,847 people in Belgium are infected with the new coronary virus.
Katri warned earlier this week that action must be taken before the snowball rolls and eventually results in an avalanche.
In an effort to curb the resurgence of the epidemic, the Prime Minister of Belgium, Sophie Villemes, announced on 23 August that the regulations governing the wearing of masks in public places would be tightened and that the programme for the further lifting of restrictive measures in August would be suspended.

1 new case of non-symptomatic infections outside the country by Jiangsu - Chinese new network
According to the official Weibo of the Health Commission of Jiangsu province, there were no new confirmed cases in Jiangsu at 0-24 hours on 25 July.
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, 655 confirmed cases had been reported across the province (of which 24 cases had been entered outside the country), with the exception of one case imported outside the country and treated in isolation at a targeted hospital, the rest having been discharged.
On that date, one new case of non-symptomatic infection was added.
As at 2400 hours on 25 July, four cases of asymptomatic infections were concentrated in isolation and medical management and were imported from abroad.
At present, 14084 close contacts with confirmed cases and persons with an asymptomatic infection have been tracked throughout the province, 13943 have been released from medical observation and 141 are still under medical observation.
[Editor: Chen Hai Feng]
On 25 July, Xinhua, Hong Kong, Xinhua, the Director of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development of the HKSAR Government, Qiu Tenghua, stated that all APEC member economies should act in concert to combat the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should refrain from creating unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations established by the World Trade Organization.
Quintenghua made the above statement in the context of its participation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 25 Ministerial Video Conference on Combating the New Crown Pneumonia Epidemic.
At the meeting, ministers exchanged views on the substantive options that APEC could take to respond to the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic and to promote economic recovery in the region.
Qiu Tenghua stated that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic had an unprecedented far-reaching social and economic impact.
“We are in a double battle, and we must overcome the epidemic before we can recover the economy.
We want clear goals, and the virus is our common enemy, and cooperation is the only way to win, and vice versa.”
