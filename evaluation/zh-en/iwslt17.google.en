Well, I&#39;m going to tell you a story about how we know what we know.
This story is about this woman, Natalia Liczynski.
She is a paleontologist, and her specialty is digging up ancient things everywhere.
Natalia Liczynski: &quot;Yes, some people call me Dr. Dead Stuff.&quot;
I find her particularly interesting because the places where she digs are all in the high-latitude Arctic Circle and the remote Canadian tundra.
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at an archaeological dig called Fals Leaf Bed, less than 10 degrees latitude from the magnetic North Pole.
NR: &quot;Honestly, that doesn&#39;t sound like much fun.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re carrying a backpack with a GPS and a laptop all day long,&quot; &quot;You&#39;re walking long distances and picking up things that might be fossils. .”
At some point, however, she noticed something.
&quot;A little rust-colored thing,&quot; about as big as the palm of my hand. &quot;
&#39;It just lay on the ground. &quot;
Her first reaction was that it was just a splinter of wood, because it was something people had found in the leaf beds of Fars - prehistoric plant matter.
But that night, back at camp…
NR: &quot;...I took out the hand-held microscope,&quot; &#39;I looked more carefully, and suddenly I realized, &#39;&#39;This thing doesn&#39;t seem to have growth rings.&#39;
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s due to preservation issues,&quot; &quot;But it really looks like...&quot;
&quot;bone.&quot;
So over the next four years, she returned to that location repeatedly, and eventually collected 30 fragments, all from the same bone, many of which were extremely tiny.
&quot;It&#39;s actually not a lot. It can fit in a small zipper bag.&quot;
Then she tried to put the pieces together like a puzzle.
But this is very challenging.
&quot;It broke into so many tiny pieces,&quot; &quot;We tried to restore it with sand and putty, but it looked terrible.&quot;
&quot;In the end, we used a 3D surface scanner.&quot;
Whoa whoa! &quot;Very handsome, right?&quot;
In the end, I found that it was much easier to restore it virtually.
&quot;When it all comes together, it feels really magical.&quot;
How sure are you that you got it right, that is, exactly how it is?
Is it possible that you could spell it out another way and end up with...a little parrot or something?
&quot;Uh, no. We must have got it right.&quot;
She discovered that what she spelled out was a tibia, or calf bone, and that this tibia came from an artiodactyl mammal, such as a cow or a sheep.
But there&#39;s no way it&#39;s a cow or a sheep.
It&#39;s just too big.
&quot;The size of this thing is really huge. It&#39;s a huge animal.&quot;
So what kind of animal could it be?
Now she hit a wall, so she showed a piece of it to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and they got an idea.
&quot;We took a little saw and scraped a little bit on the edge of the piece,&quot; &quot;and there were some really amazing smells coming out of there.&quot;
It smells a bit like burnt skin.
It was a scent that Natalya recognized, having smelled it while cutting skulls in the gross anatomy lab: collagen.
Collagen gives our bones their strength.
Generally speaking, after so many years, it will naturally break down.
However, in this case, the North Pole acts like a natural freezer to preserve it.
A year or two later, Natalia went to a conference in Bristol, and she saw a colleague of hers, a guy named Mike Buckley, demonstrating a new technology that he called &quot;collagen fingerprinting.&quot; .
In fact, there are slight differences in the structure of collagen from different species, so if you have collagen information of an unknown bone, you can compare it with collagen information of known species, so who knows, maybe you can Matching information found.
So she sent Mike a piece of it, FedEx.
&quot;Of course, you have to keep an eye on the delivery progress. It&#39;s very important.&quot;
He then processed the sample and compared it with 37 known contemporary mammal species.
Found a match!
The final conclusion was that the 3.5 million-year-old bone discovered by Natalia in the high-latitude Arctic Circle came from...
A camel.
&quot;I was like, are you kidding me?&quot; &quot;If we&#39;re not mistaken, this is amazing.&quot;
So they tested a bunch of shards and got the same results on every shard.
However, judging by the size of the bone they found, that means the camel was 30 percent larger than modern camels.
So this camel is about 2.7 meters tall and weighs a ton.
(exclamation) That&#39;s right.
Natalia discovers a &quot;giant arctic camel&quot;.
Now when you hear the word &quot;camel,&quot; this is what comes to mind: the Bactrian camels of East and Central Asia.
But more likely, the image in your mind is more like this: a dromedary, a typical desert animal, often found in hot desert areas, such as the Middle East or the Sahara, with an oversized hump on its back, making it It stores water for long journeys in the desert, and has wide feet to help them traverse sand dunes.
So how did these guys get to the high-latitude Arctic Circle?
In fact, scientists have known for a long time, even before Natalia&#39;s discovery, that camels first originated in the Americas.
(Music: The American national anthem &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;) They originated here.
For 40 million of the 45 million years that camels have existed, you could only find them in North America. There were 20 different species in total, maybe more than that.
&quot;If we lined them up, would they look different?&quot;
&quot;Yes, their body sizes vary greatly.&quot;
&quot;Some have extremely long necks,&quot; &quot;So they function very much like giraffes.&quot;
Some also have long snouts, like those of crocodiles.
&quot;They were very primitive, and some of the earliest ones were probably very small,&quot; &quot;almost like a little rabbit.&quot;
What? A camel the size of a rabbit?
&quot;Some of the earliest ones, yes.&quot;
&quot;You might not even recognize those.&quot;
Oh my gosh, I really want a &quot;rabbit camel&quot; as a pet!
&quot;I know, this will be great, right?&quot;
Then about 3 million to 7 million years ago, one branch of camels migrated south to South America, where they evolved into llamas or alpacas, and another branch crossed the Bering land bridge and reached Asia and Africa.
Around the end of the last Ice Age, camels in North America became completely extinct.
Well, scientists already knew this, but it didn&#39;t fully explain how Natalia found camels so far north.
Here, from a temperature perspective, it is simply the antonym of Sahara.
To be honest, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher than today.
So it was kind of a northern forest, kind of like today&#39;s Yukon River Basin or Siberia.
However, they still have six months of winter, and all the ponds are frozen.
You get a blizzard.
You will experience 24 hours of continuous darkness.
In the end...what happened?
How could these Sahara superstars survive such frigid conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues think they have the answer.
And the answer is quite clever.
What if these characteristics of camels were not developed to adapt to an environment like the Sahara as we think, but evolved because they had to survive the harsh winter?
What if those wide feet are not meant to step over sand dunes, but like snow boots, to step across snowfields?
If we talk about those humps - this is huge news! Instead of storing water but fat, the humps are actually meant to help camels survive the six-month-long winter when food is scarce?
What if it was much later, after they crossed the land bridge, that they modified these winter characteristics to adapt them to the hot desert environment?
For example, those humps might be good for camels in hot areas, because when you have fat deposited in one place, you know, like a &quot;fat backpack,&quot; it means your body&#39;s insulation doesn&#39;t have to be all over the body.
So this makes it easier to dissipate heat.
It was this crazy idea that suddenly turned the seemingly typical desert characteristics of camels into evidence of their origins in the high latitude Arctic.
Actually I am not the first person to tell this story.
Others have spoken about it as a way to marvel at the wonders of biological evolution or as a glimpse into future climate change.
But I love this story so much for a different reason.
To me, this is a story about us, about how we perceive the world, and how that perception changes.
I am a historian by profession.
I discovered that many scientists are actually historians.
They make sense of the past.
They tell the history of the universe, the earth and its creatures.
As a historian, you need to have an idea in your mind about how the story unfolded.
&quot;We make up stories, and then we follow the thread,&quot; &quot;It&#39;s like camels in the desert, right?&quot;
&quot;What a great story! Camels are just perfect for the desert.&quot;
&quot;Apparently, camels have always lived there.&quot;
But at any time, you may find some small clues.
You might discover little things that force you to reshape everything you thought you knew.
Just like in this case, this scientist discovered this fragment, which she thought was wood. Because of this discovery, the scientific community came up with a new, counter-intuitive theory to explain why this strange, hairy-looking monster The creature grew into what it is now.
For me, this completely changed my view of camels.
It went from being a creature that existed only for this particular environment to a globetrotter that just happened to be in the Sahara Desert and could be anywhere at any time.
This is Azuli.
Hi Azuli! How are you?
Come, I brought you something to eat.
Azuli has just completed her special performance and came from New York&#39;s Radio City Music Hall.
This is no joke.
Whatever... Seriously, Azuli is here as a living example of how the world&#39;s stories can change quickly.
We must take the initiative to boldly make changes and reimagine.
Azuli, are you right?
Really, we are only a bone apart from a new perspective on the world.
Thank you all.
Today&#39;s computers are so amazing that we even overlook how bad they actually are.
Today I&#39;m going to talk to you about this problem and how we can use neuroscience to solve it.
First, I want to take you back to a cold night in Harlem in 2011, a night that has profound meaning for me.
I&#39;m sitting in a bar next to Columbia University, where I major in computer science and neuroscience, and I&#39;m having an interesting conversation with a classmate about the power of holography to one day replace computers.
Just as our conversation was reaching its climax, as expected, his phone rang.
He picked up his phone, lowered his head and started typing.
Then he would look up at me from time to time and say, &quot;Keep talking, I&#39;m listening.&quot;
But it was obvious that his eyes were not focused, and a wonderful moment passed so fleetingly.
Meanwhile, across the bar, I noticed another student holding his cell phone, this time surrounded by a group of people in front of the screen.
He was looking through photos on Instagram, and these kids were laughing.
Facing the same technology, they felt so happy, but I felt extremely frustrated. This strong contrast immediately caused me to think.
As I thought about it more deeply, it became clear to me that the problem here was not the electronic information, but simply the placement of the information that separated me from my friends but brought these kids together.
It&#39;s clear that they are being connected by something, just like our ancestors evolved their social cognition, like telling stories around a campfire.
In my opinion, this is exactly what tools should do.
They are supposed to extend our bodily functions.
I think computers today are doing the exact opposite.
Whether you&#39;re sending an email to your wife, composing a symphony, or simply comforting a friend, you&#39;re almost always doing it the same way.
You bend over the blocks, playing with buttons and menus, and more blocks appear.
I think this is the wrong approach, and I think we can start using a more natural machine.
The machines we use should bring our work back to real life.
We should use machines that use neuroscience principles to extend our senses, not limit them.
Now I happen to have such a machine here.
It&#39;s called Meta 2.
Let&#39;s try it.
Now I can see the audience, and I can see my hands.
On the count of 3, 2, 1, we will see a holographic image appear, a very real holographic image appear in front of me, in front of the glasses I am wearing now.
Of course this could be anything we&#39;re planning to buy or learn, and I can easily control its movement with my hands.
And I think Iron Man would be proud.
We&#39;ll come back later.
(Audience applauds) If you&#39;re like me, you&#39;re probably already thinking about what you can do with this technology. Let&#39;s look at some examples.
My mom is an architect, so naturally the first thing I imagined was to draw a three-dimensional building instead of these flat floor plans.
In fact she was now touching the blueprints to choose an interior decoration.
These were all captured by the GoPro in my glasses.
The next use case, which is very personal to me, is Professor Adam Gozerai&#39;s glass brain project, which I would like to thank UCSF for licensing.
As a neuroscience major, I&#39;m always amazed by the ability to learn and remember these complex brain structures with a real machine that allows me to touch and play with different brain structures.
What you&#39;re seeing now is called augmented reality, but to me, it&#39;s part of a much bigger story - the story of how we&#39;re starting to use digital devices to extend our bodies, rather than limit our bodily functions.
So--
In the next few years, humanity is going to go through a transformation, I think.
We will begin to overlay a whole layer of digital information on the real world.
Take a moment to imagine what this means to a storyteller, to a painter, to a brain surgeon, to an interior decorator, and maybe to all of us here today, after all. means nothing.
I think what we have to do as a group is really try and work hard to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, rather than gamifying our reality or merging reality and digital. Information mixed together.
That&#39;s what I&#39;m very interested in doing.
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.
In about five years -- and this won&#39;t be the smallest device -- in about five years, these will look like strips of glasses that sit in front of your eyes and project holographic images.
Just like we don&#39;t care much about the hardware parameters of different mobile phones - which mobile phone we buy depends on the operating system - as a neuroscientist, I always hope to build a brain-based iOS, if possible.
It is very, very important that we ensure that it runs properly, because the time with these things may not be shorter than the time we are exposed to the Windows graphical user interface.
I don&#39;t know about you, but living in Windows is a bit scary to me.
In order to isolate the single most intuitive interface to infinity, we used neuroscience to guide our design, rather than having a bunch of designers arguing in the design room.
The principle on which we evolved is called the &quot;neural pipeline of least resistance.&quot;
At every moment of change, we connect the brain iOS system to our brain, for the first time, using the language of our brain.
In other words, we are trying to create a computer with zero learning curve.
We&#39;re building a system that you&#39;ve always known how to use.
These were the first three design guidelines we used in this new form of user experience.
First, you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they require your brain to go through many twists and turns to decode them.
We go the opposite route of the “neural pipeline of least resistance.”
Meanwhile, in augmented reality, you could certainly put your holographic TED display here and your holographic mail on the other side of the table, and your spatial memory has evolved just enough to extract that information accurately. .
You could put a hologram of a Tesla in the middle of an online purchase here — or whatever my legal team tells me before I go on stage.
(Audience laughter) Well, your brain does know how to get back to reality.
The second interface guideline is what we call &quot;contact visibility.&quot;
What do babies do when they see something that interests them?
They will try to reach for it.
This is how natural machines work too.
The visual system actually gets a very basic boost from what we might call proprioception - the sense that parts of our body are in space.
By having direct contact with what we work with, we not only control it better, we understand it on a deeper level.
This is &quot;contact visibility&quot;.
But it’s not enough for us to experience things ourselves.
We are social primates.
This brings me to our third guide, &quot;The Holographic Bonfire&quot; from our first story:
Our mirror-neural subsystem shows that we can be better connected to each person and our work if we can see three-dimensional images of each person&#39;s face and hands.
So, if you look at the video behind me, you can see two Meta users working on the same holographic image, establishing eye contact, focusing on the thing and not being distracted by outside equipment. force.
Let’s try it again with the concepts of neuroscience.
Here we go again, with our favorite interface, Brain for iOS.
I&#39;m going to take a step forward now and go to the front and grab these glasses. Then put it here on the table.
I am in a moment with you right now, and we are connected.
My spatial memory is working and I can go over there and grab it and bring it back here and remind myself that I&#39;m an operating system.
Now that my proprioception is working, I can go over and burst these glass into a thousand pieces and touch the sensor that&#39;s scanning my hand right now.
But seeing this isn&#39;t enough, so soon, my co-founder Ryan will be making a 3D phone call to me - Ryan?
Hi Ryan, how are you doing?
Folks, I can see this person appearing in front of me in a three-dimensional projection.
And his images are very real.
(Audience applauds) Thank you.
My mirror-neural subsystem suggests this will replace the phone in the near future.
Ryan, how are you?
Ryan: I&#39;m fine. We can finally demonstrate it live.
(Audience applauds) Ryan, give everyone the holographic brain we saw in the short video as a little gift.
Folks, this is not only going to change the way we make phone calls, it&#39;s going to change the way we work together.
Thank you so much.
Thanks, Ryan.
Ryan: You&#39;re welcome.
(Audience applauds) Myron Gribetz: Well, folks, this is what I discovered in that bar in 2011: The future of computing is not locked inside these screens.
But here, in our bodies.
(Audience applauds) So if I can leave you with one thought today, it&#39;s that natural machines don&#39;t just exist in the imagination of the future, they are here, in 2016.
That&#39;s why hundreds of people at Meta - executives, executives, designers, engineers - before TED2017, we&#39;re going to throw away our external display device and replace it with a real, more natural machine. .
Thank you so much.
(Audience applauds) Thank you.
thank you all.
Chris Anderson: I have a question. There have been a lot of demonstrations of holography in the last year.
Sometimes there&#39;s a debate in the tech world about whether we&#39;re actually seeing real things on the screen?
That&#39;s a problem in this space, to the extent that technology is showing a broader perspective than what you can actually see with your glasses on.
Did we just see real effects?
Myron Gribetz: It&#39;s definitely a real effect.
Not only that, but we also used additional measurement techniques to shoot through real lenses with a GoPro to get the various different clips you see here.
We want to try to realize the experience of the world through what we see through our glasses, rather than just seeing part of it.
CA: Thank you so much for the presentation.
MG: Thank you very much.
I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant and promising cities in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a great Seattle family.
My mother is an artist and my father is a university professor. I am grateful for their upbringing, because I have the freedom to plan my life the way I see fit.
In fact, my choice was different from what my parents had in mind.
When I was 19, I dropped out of college—dropped out, or more accurately, got kicked out.
I embarked on the path to becoming a professional French horn player, which has been my lifelong dream.
I performed chamber music all over the United States and Europe, and I toured for several years with Charlie Byrd, a very good jazz guitarist.
In my twenties, I was excited to join the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a wonderful life!
And my parents never complained,
They supported me from beginning to end,
Even if that&#39;s not their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, &quot;Our son is going to take a &#39;rest&#39; for ten years.&quot;
And there’s an awkward conversation about my life that I want to share with you.
I was 27 years old at the time, and I came home from Barcelona, and it was Christmas, and I was visiting my parents, and I was helping my mother make dinner, and we were the only two people in the kitchen.
She was silent and said nothing.
I feel something is wrong.
I asked my mother: &quot;Mom, what are you thinking about?&quot;
&quot;Your dad and I are really worried about you,&quot; she said.
I was surprised: &quot;What? What do you have to worry about now?&quot;
She replied: &quot;I want you to answer my question honestly: Did you vote Republican?&quot;
The truth is, I have no interest in politics. I&#39;m just a French trumpet player.
But I kind of get it, they&#39;re aware of something, so they&#39;re a little confused.
That&#39;s when I became a big fan of capitalism, and let me tell you why.
Believe it or not, it has its roots in my ongoing research on poverty.
When I was a kid in Seattle, I remember that was my first exposure to real poverty.
My family was in the lower middle class, but that was certainly not true poverty.
Not at all.
The first time I saw the true face of poverty was in the early 1970s, when I was only six or seven years old.
Like many of us, this example is mundane.
It was a painting in National Geographic of a kid about my age from a country in East Africa. Flies were flying in his face and his belly was swollen.
I knew he wasn&#39;t going to make it, I knew it, and there was nothing I could do.
Some of you may remember a painting like that, not necessarily exactly the same, but a very similar painting.
It showed the Western world the unbearable poverty in other parts of the world.
That image lingered in my mind as I grew up, went to school, dropped out of school, and started a family of my own.
I really want to know, what happened to that child?
Or what about people like him in other parts of the world?
I started researching this question, and even though I was no longer in college, I was still looking for answers: What was happening to the poorest people in the world?
Is it getting worse or better? What happened?
I finally found the answer, and it changed my life. I want to share it with you.
In fact, most Americans feel that from their childhood, from the time they saw that scene to this day,
Poverty has become worse. If you asked Americans, &quot;Is world poverty getting worse or getting better?&quot; 70 percent would say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s.
However the fact is this.
This was the moment that changed my mind and gave me an epiphany.
The percentage of the world&#39;s population living on less than $1 a day, adjusted for inflation, is hungry by 80 percent since 1970.
The percentage of the world&#39;s poorest people has decreased by 80% since I was a child.
But I don&#39;t know this fact.
My friends, this is a miracle!
This is something we should celebrate.
This is the greatest achievement in the fight against poverty in human history, and it happens within our lifetime.
When I knew this fact, I thought, what makes poverty alleviation possible?
Because if you don&#39;t know why, it&#39;s just a blip.
We&#39;re going to replicate that success and lift the 200 million people who are still struggling in poverty out of their current situation, because that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been talking about since I was a kid: 2 billion of the poorest people, our brothers and sisters, out of the situation. of poverty.
I want to save the other two billion people, so I have to know why.
I&#39;m looking for answers,
It&#39;s not a political answer, because I don&#39;t care about political answers at all.
Now, I still don&#39;t care.
I crave the best answers from mainstream economists on the left, right and center.
under
I started to talk about the specific reasons.
From childhood to now, 2 billion people have been lifted out of poverty
There are five reasons. First: Globalization
Second: free trade
Third: property rights
Fourth: Rule of law
Fifth: Entrepreneurship
These are caused by the free market economic system that swept the world after 1970.
I&#39;m not naive.
I know that the free market economy is not perfect. I also know that the free market economy cannot meet all of our needs to build a better world.
But it&#39;s great.
And it transcends politics.
This is something I learned and had an epiphany about.
Capitalism is not just the accumulation of capital
What&#39;s great about it is: it&#39;s about ambition, and this is what a lot of people on this stage have said, ambition born of dreams, and it&#39;s rooted in the free market system.
We must let more people understand this.
Now, I want to talk about my second epiphany, which is related to the first one and I believe it will not only improve the development of the world, but also improve the development of our country.
To sum up the point just made about lifting people out of poverty, someone else said: “The free market has created the most wealth in history.
and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. &quot;
Whose famous quote?
Like Milton Friedman&#39;s or Ronald Reagan&#39;s.
wrong!
It&#39;s President Obama!
Why do I remember it so well?
Because he said it to me.
Unexpectedly.
I was like, &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;
More than that, I said, &quot;What an amazing opportunity.&quot;
Do you know what I was thinking at that time?
In May 2015, we held an event at Georgetown University about our topic.
That’s when I came up with solutions to the biggest problems facing America today. what is that?
It&#39;s about libertarians and conservatives coming together to discuss these ideas to help those who need our help the most.
Needless to say, everyone here knows that we are in a crisis, in the United States and in other politically divided countries around the world.
This problem is urgent.
This can&#39;t help but make people worried.
Last year, an article was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most influential and cutting-edge scientific magazines in the West.
That was an article from 2014 about the asymmetry of political motivations.
what is that? Psychologists describe this phenomenon as assuming that your mindset is based on love and the other person&#39;s mindset is based on hate.
This is common in world disputes.
Such as between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the author of this article found is that in the United States today, a large number of Republicans and Democrats are divided on political motivations.
Most of the people who are politically active in our country today think they are driven by love, while the rest are driven by hate.
think about it.
Most people always say, &quot;I&#39;m based on charity, I want to help people, and the other group of people, they&#39;re evil, they&#39;re trying to bring me down.&quot;
A society with such divisions cannot progress.
it&#39;s out of the question.
How do we solve this problem?
First, let&#39;s be honest: disagreements exist.
We cannot reduce our differences because that would be childish behavior.
There is quite a bit of in-depth research on this.
My friend Jonathan Haidt is a frequent TED speaker.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He studies the thoughts, values, and morals of different people and how they differ.
He demonstrates that conservatives and liberals have very different ideas about what they consider important.
For example, Jonathan Haidt shows that liberals care about poverty more than they care about economic freedom by 59%.
And conservatives are 28% more concerned about economic freedom than poverty.
Seems like irreconcilable differences, right?
It&#39;s impossible for us to get together? No!
Our strength lies precisely in our differences.
Remember what stops poverty:
It&#39;s the obsession and concern with poverty and the liberal economic order around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people, we want to help another 200 million people escape poverty.
There is no other way.
Um.
What do we do?
It&#39;s a subtle thing, isn&#39;t it?
We need innovative thinking.
Many innovative ideas exist on this stage.
Yes! The entrepreneurial spirit of those extraordinary societies.
We must invest overseas in a sustainable, responsible, and ethical manner.
But do you know what we really need?
We need to open up new worlds of flexible thinking,
We need less &quot;predictability&quot;,
Is it right?
Have you ever felt like your thoughts were starting to become predictable?
Start following the rules?
Do you feel like you always listen to people who agree with you?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk about economics in this country, the conservatives on one side always talk about taxes and rules and big government.
And on the other side are liberals, who talk about the economy and it&#39;s always about income inequality.
right? Those are indeed important, important to me and important to you.
But these are just distractions when those who are hungry need our help.
We should unite around the best ways to reduce poverty as much as we can, only if conservatives realize they need liberals&#39; worries about poverty, and liberals need conservatives&#39; obsession with free markets.
Only then will we succeed. Only if we choose this path will this diversity give birth to the great strength of the country in the future.
How do we achieve this? How to achieve it together?
I have some suggestions for action, both for you and for myself.
Rule of Action No. 1: Remember, it is not good enough to simply tolerate other people’s different opinions.
Far from enough.
We need to remember that we need people with whom we disagree, because there is a group of people who need help from all of us and they are still waiting.
What are you going to do? How to behave?
Where to start? Right from here!
All of us here, we are happy.
We have people who listen to us,
We are successful and we have leadership.
When people hear our unknown ideological ideas, maybe they will listen to us.
Maybe this is where success starts.
This is the first point. second.
Second point: I am asking you, and I am asking myself, to become a specific person with blurred boundaries, to be a vague, hard-to-define person.
If you are a conservative, be a conservative who speaks out about poverty and a warrior who insists on your moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If you&#39;re a liberal, be a liberal who often extols the beauty of free markets when we run them responsibly.
If we do that, two goals are within reach.
First: We start working on helping the next 2 billion people solve their problems as we have solved so many problems before and we will solve many more in the future. This is something we can do.
The second is that we might be able to overcome the terrible ideological war that has caused us so much suffering and turn it into a competition based on ideas of solidarity and mutual respect.
Maybe then, just maybe, we will discover that our so-called differences are not so irreconcilable.
Thanks!
When I was in college, I majored in government affairs, which meant I had to write a lot of papers.
When a typical student writes a paper, they might spread out the tasks like this.
So, you know it might be a little slow at first, but by the end of the week you&#39;ve written a lot, and then sometimes you&#39;ve written a little more, and by the end it&#39;s all worked out and things don&#39;t get messed up.
I want that too.
At least that&#39;s my plan.
I was ready to get started, and yet, actually, when it came time to write the paper, that&#39;s exactly what I did.
And it happens every time I write a paper.
Finally it came time to write a 90-page graduation thesis, a thesis that should have taken me a year to write.
I knew that for a paper like this, my usual approach wouldn&#39;t work.
The thesis is a big project.
So I planned it and decided to do it.
This is how a year&#39;s work is arranged.
Work less at first, then continue to work more for a few months, and finally go all out in high gear, just like small steps.
How hard can it be to climb stairs?
No big deal, right?
But then, something interesting happened.
Those first few months?
Coming and going, I basically did nothing.
So there was this great modification plan.
And then... the intervening months passed by like this, and I basically didn&#39;t write a few words, so it ended up like this.
Then it went from two months to one month to two weeks to two.
Then one day I suddenly realized that there were only three days left before the deadline, and I hadn&#39;t written a word yet, so I did the only thing I could do: I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, staying up all night for two full days. Rush workers are not supposed to pull two all-nighters in a row and race across campus at full speed, sneaking in in slow motion to get a paper in before the deadline.
I thought that was the end of it.
As a result, a week later I received a call from the school.
They asked, “Are you Tim Urban?”
I said, &quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;
They said, &quot;We need to talk to you about the paper.&quot;
I answered, &quot;Okay&quot;
The other person then said, &quot;This is the best paper we&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;
(Applause) That didn&#39;t happen.
This paper is very, very poorly written.
I just want to enjoy this moment when you all think, &quot;This guy is awesome!&quot;
No, that paper was terrible.
Anyway, I’m a blogger now.
I write a blog post for &quot;Broken Casserole and Asking the End.&quot;
A few years ago I decided to write an article about procrastination.
My procrastination behavior always confuses the non-procrastinators around me, so I wanted to explain to non-procrastinators what goes on in the minds of procrastinators and why we procrastinators behave the way we do.
My hypothesis is that the brains of procrastinators are different from the brains of non-procrastinators.
To prove this, I found an MRI lab that allowed me to scan my own brain and the brain of someone who was proven not to be a procrastinator, and then I could compare the two brains.
I brought them all today.
I hope everyone can carefully compare whether there is any difference between the two.
I know you&#39;re not a trained brain expert, and it might not seem obvious, but let&#39;s look at it, shall we?
This is the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now,
This is my brain.
There is a difference between the two.
There is a rational decision-maker in both brains, but there is also an instant gratification monkey in the procrastinator&#39;s brain.
What does this mean for procrastinators?
It means that everything was fine before this happened.
[Now is the perfect time to get started.] [No way!] So when the rational decision maker makes a rational decision and wants to do something productive, the monkey doesn&#39;t want to do it, so he takes the wheel. , and he said, &quot;Actually, let&#39;s read up on Wikipedia about the Nancy Kerrigan/Tony Yahadin scandal, because I just remembered it.
Then let&#39;s go to the refrigerator and look through it to see if there&#39;s anything new in the past 10 minutes.
After that, let&#39;s continue browsing on the video website, starting from the video of Richard Feynman talking about magnetism, and continuing to the interview with Justin Bieber&#39;s mother until the end of time.
“It all takes time, so we don’t have time in our schedule today to do it.
terribly sorry! &quot;
What&#39;s going on?
The Instant Gratification Monkey doesn&#39;t seem like the person you want behind the wheel.
He lives completely in the moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and only cares about two things: simplicity and happiness.
In the animal world, this is fine.
If you are a dog and you spend this life simply and happily, it is already a huge success!
To monkeys, humans are another animal.
You sleep well, you eat well, and you reproduce, which might have been fine in tribal times.
But, in case you haven&#39;t noticed, we don&#39;t live in tribal times right now.
We are in an advanced civilization, and monkeys have no idea what it is.
That&#39;s why we have this other guy in our head, the rational decision-maker, who gives us the ability to do things that other animals can&#39;t.
We can foresee the future.
We can look at the big picture.
We can plan for the long term.
And he wanted to take it all into account.
He wants us to do anything worth doing now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do simple pleasures, like eating, sleeping, or enjoying some well-earned leisure time.
This is why there is an overlap between instant gratification monkeys and rational decision makers.
Sometimes they agree.
But sometimes, it makes more sense to do things that are harder and less enjoyable, for the sake of the bigger picture.
At this time there will be a conflict between the two.
For the procrastinator, every conflict ends in a way that he spends a lot of time in the orange zone, which is the zone of simplicity and joy, but also meaninglessness.
I call this area the dark playground.
The dark playground is a place all procrastinators know well.
This is a place for leisure and entertainment activities when leisure is not supposed to be done.
The happiness you get in the dark playground is not actually happiness, because it is completely unearned. This will bring guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-hatred, which are the feelings of all procrastinators.
And the question is, in this situation, with the monkey at the wheel, how can the procrastinator be allowed to take himself to the blue zone, which is less comfortable but has a lot of important things to do.
In fact, the procrastinator has a guardian angel that always looks down on him and watches over him, and in those darkest moments it&#39;s called the Panic Monster.
The panic monster spends most of its time hibernating, but it suddenly wakes up when a deadline is close, when you&#39;re in danger of being embarrassed in public, when you&#39;re facing career disaster, or when there are other dire consequences.
And importantly, he is the only thing the monkey is afraid of.
The Panic Monster has become very important in my life recently because the people at TED contacted me six months ago and asked me to give a talk.
Of course, I agreed.
I have always dreamed of giving a TED talk.
(Applause) But amid all this excitement, rational decision-makers seemed to be thinking about something else.
He would say: &quot;Do we know what we just promised?
Do we have what it takes now to accomplish that task in the future?
We have to sit down and start working. &quot;
And the monkey said, &quot;I totally agree, but let&#39;s open Google Earth and push the camera 200 feet underground in India, and then spend two and a half hours scrolling up to the surface of the country, so we can get a better feel for India.&quot;
That&#39;s what I did that day.
When 6 months turned into 4 months, then 2 months, then 1 month, TED staff started releasing speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face staring back at me.
Guess who woke up at this time?
So the panic monster starts going crazy, and within seconds the whole system is in chaos.
And monkey, remember? He was afraid of the Panic Monster and he climbed into the tree!
So finally, the rational decision-maker finally took the wheel, and I could start preparing this speech.
Panic Monster sees all those rather stupid procrastination behaviors as someone like me who spends two weeks unable to start writing the opening paragraph of a paper and then miraculously stays up all night with incredible work enthusiasm. Wrote 8 pages.
This whole situation, plus those three roles, is the procrastinator&#39;s system.
Not pretty, but at least it&#39;s useful.
This is something I decided to blog about a few years ago.
After posting it, I was surprised by the response I received.
I get thousands of emails from people in different places around the world doing all kinds of different things.
There are nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and many, many PhD students.
The content is basically the same: &quot;I have this problem too.&quot;
But what struck me was the contrast between the light-hearted tone of the post and the heavy tone of the emails.
These people have a strong sense of frustration because procrastination affects their lives because the monkey controls their thoughts.
After thinking about it, my question is if the procrastinator&#39;s system works, what exactly is going on?
Why do these people have such a dark corner?
It turns out that there are two types of procrastination.
What I talked about today, the examples above all have deadlines.
When there is a deadline, the impact of procrastination is limited to a shorter deadline because the panic monster steps in.
But with the second type of procrastination it happens when there is no deadline.
For example, if you want to start your own business or engage in art work, there will be no deadline at first, because nothing will happen before you start working hard, and there will be no driving force to keep things going.
There are no deadlines for important things besides your career, such as visiting your family, or exercising to stay healthy, working on improving your romantic relationship, or leaving an unsatisfying relationship.
If procrastinators have only one mechanism for doing these difficult things, the panic monster, then there&#39;s a problem, because in these situations where there are no deadlines, the panic monster doesn&#39;t appear at all.
He has no need to wake up, so the consequences of delays are unlimited, they are simply postponed indefinitely.
And this kind of long-term procrastination is less obvious and less often talked about than the more interesting, short-term, deadline-based kind.
It usually affects us quietly and quietly.
It can be the source of a lot of chronic unhappiness and guilt.
I feel like that&#39;s why those people are sending emails, that&#39;s why they&#39;re in such a bad situation.
It’s not because they are rushing for a certain project,
Rather, this chronic procrastination makes them feel as if they are only bystanders at times in their own lives.
Their frustration isn&#39;t that they can&#39;t achieve their dreams; it&#39;s that they can&#39;t even begin to chase their dreams.
So after reading these emails, I kind of realized that I don&#39;t think there is such a thing as a person who doesn&#39;t procrastinate.
Yes, I think we all are procrastinators.
You may not be like us, a mess in every aspect, and maybe some people can handle deadlines just fine, but remember: the monkey&#39;s most despicable trick lies in the parts that don&#39;t have deadlines.
Now I want to show you one last thing.
I call it a life calendar.
Suppose a person can live to be 90 years old, and each week is a grid.
There really aren&#39;t many boxes, especially since we&#39;ve lived for so many years.
I think we all need to take some time and really look at this life calendar.
We need to really think about what we are really procrastinating about, because everyone is procrastinating about something.
We must always be aware of the instant gratification monkey.
This is something we all should do.
And since there aren&#39;t many grids, this work should probably start today.
Well, maybe not today, but...
You know.
Near future.
Thanks.
We&#39;re right there. Souls and bodies crowded together in a Texas church on the last night of our lives.
It&#39;s like our room now, except that it&#39;s full of creaking wooden benches and tattered red cloth strips. The organ is on my left, the choir is behind me, and there&#39;s a baptistery built in the back. on the wall.
Anyway, it&#39;s like this room.
The same strong sense of suspense, the same profound desire for redemption, the same sour sweat in the palms, and the same bunch of absent-minded people in the back row.
It was December 31, 1999. That night, as far as I knew, Christ returned to earth and the world was about to end.
I was 12 years old at the time, an age where I needed to be responsible.
I found it so unfair that Jesus would come back at this time, and I would be held accountable for everything I had done. But when I stopped complaining, I thought I&#39;d better get my house in order.
I go to church as much as I can.
I&#39;m afraid of the silence around me, just like people are afraid of noise, just to make sure again and again that God is not playing tricks on me and leaving me behind when I come back early.
But if he does come early, I also have a backup plan, which I read in the popular book &quot;The End of the World&quot;.
I saw in the text that if I was not taken away after the midnight carnival, I would have another chance.
I just need to not be called a heretic, defeat demons, overcome plagues, and defeat the Antichrist.
It&#39;s going to be pretty hard -- but I believe I can do it.
But the time for preparation has long since passed.
It&#39;s already 11:50 pm.
We had 10 minutes left, and the pastor asked us to get up from the pews and walk down to the altar because he wanted us to pray together as midnight approached.
So the congregation divided into several groups and arrived at the designated locations.
The choir was still on the small stage, and the church deacons and their wives—in fact, I prefer to call them &quot;Baptist bourgeoisie&quot;—sat down in the first row in front of the altar.
You know, in the United States, there are VIP seats even on Advent Night.
And just behind the Baptist bourgeoisie are the older generations - the young backs of these men and women were bent by the blazing sun in the cotton fields of East Texas, and their ravaged faces were burned into noble Brown, like the clay of East Texas, their beautiful fantasies and dreams about life and the world outside East Texas are sometimes more broken than their backs.
Yes - these men and women are my idols and stars.
They have waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval forebears longed for the end of the world, just as my grandmother longed for the Oprah Show, which airs on Channel 8 at four o&#39;clock every day.
As she walked to the altar, I snuck up behind her because I was so convinced that my grandmother was going to heaven.
I thought that if I had held her hand tightly during this prayer, I might have walked with her.
So I tightened my grip, closed my eyes, listened, and waited.
The prayers became louder.
The cry in answer to prayer was equally louder.
The organ plays, intertwined with the elegiac sounds.
The heat wave swept over me, and the sweat on my palms became even more sore.
My hands clenched tighter, I didn&#39;t want to be abandoned by God.
I closed my eyes tighter, I didn&#39;t want to see the essence being taken away and the dross being left behind.
Suddenly a voice echoed above his head: &quot;Amen.&quot;
it&#39;s over.
I look at the clock.
It&#39;s past midnight.
I look at the elder believers. Their savior has not come. They are too proud to show even a little bit of loss. They have believed too deeply and for too long. Now it is too late to doubt.
But I feel angry for them.
They were fooled, cajoled, and deceived, and yet I was deceived along with them.
I prayed the prayers they prayed, and I struggled to resist the desires of my heart.
Not once, but twice, I fell headlong into that cold baptismal font.
I believed it.
What should we do now?
I went home and turned on the TV, just in time for Peter Jennings to announce the new millennium, and the whole world was celebrating the new year.
I suddenly realized that no matter how I thought about it, it was strange that Jesus would come back to earth again and again just because the time zones in different places were different.
This made me feel even more uncomfortable. It was quite hurt, really.
But that night, I didn&#39;t stop believing.
I just believed another thing: that it is possible not to believe.
It&#39;s possible that the answers I know are wrong, and it&#39;s possible that the question itself is wrong.
Now, where the mountain of faith once stood, there is a spring flowing all the way to the foot of the mountain, a spring of doubt, destined to become a mighty river.
All the dramatic stories in my life can be traced back to that night in the church, when my savior did not come; the things I was extremely sure of, if not called &quot;lies&quot;, at least were not the truth.
Although most of you are approaching the new millennium in very different ways, I believe you are here because some of you have done the same thing that I did after the dawn of the new century, when my mother died and my father left home. What happened after I ran away, what happened after my savior didn’t come.
I stretched out my hands, searching hard for something to believe in.
When I went to Yale University at the age of 18, I searched and believed that all the way from small town Texas, I had a chance to escape all the hardships and hardships I had experienced, to escape the broken dreams and disabled body.
But when I returned to my hometown during the winter vacation, my head was pressed to the ground, my hands were tied tightly behind my back, and the robber&#39;s pistol was pressed against my head. I knew that even the best education could not save me.
When I interned at Lehman Brothers in 2008, I was also searching.
Full of hope - I called my family excitedly and said we would never be poor again.
But when I watched this financial temple turn into ruins before my eyes, I knew that even the best job could not save me.
When I went to Washington, D.C., as a young reporter, and I was searching, I heard a voice from Illinois: (referring to Obama&#39;s campaign speech) &quot;It&#39;s been so long,&quot; &quot;But in this election, America is going to have... change.&quot;
But when parliamentary work came to a complete standstill, when the country almost fell apart, and when so-called hope and change became a cruel joke, I knew that not even a new life in politics could save me.
I knelt down devoutly in front of the altar of the American Dream, praying to the great men of the era, praying for success, praying for money, and praying for power.
But every time the clock strikes midnight and I open my eyes, I see these myths all dead.
From this grave, I began to search again, not because I was brave, but because I knew that if I did not have faith, I would die.
So I went to another holy place to worship, Harvard Business School - this time, I knew I couldn&#39;t simply accept the salvation offered by the school.
No, I know I have more to do.
It all started in a dark corner of a crowded party, late one late night in a brutal early winter in Massachusetts, when three friends and I asked a question that young people with serious aspirations have long asked: &quot;Let&#39;s go on a road trip.&quot; how?&quot;
We didn&#39;t know where we were going or how, but we knew we had to start.
Because what we long for in life is, as Jack Kerouac wrote: &quot;To dive into the endless night and disappear into the distant sky.&quot; Go out and see what people are doing all over the country.
So even though there were objections saying that we were taking too big a risk and not gaining much, we set off anyway.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled 13,000 kilometers across the United States, through the dairy ranches of Montana, through the abandoned cities of Detroit, and through the swamps of New Orleans. We found some people there, worked for them, and they founded For small businesses, achieving goals is the bottom line.
Having studied in the &quot;West Point of Capitalism,&quot; we found this idea to be nothing short of revolutionary.
The idea spread and eventually grew into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America, which is the main reason I&#39;m here today.
It spreads because we find in this generation a strong desire to achieve goals and values in life.
It can spread because we have found countless entrepreneurs in every corner of the United States, who are creating jobs and changing the lives of others, and they still need a little help.
But to be honest, it can spread because I work hard to spread it. To spread this gospel,
There&#39;s nothing I won&#39;t do to convince more people that we can heal the wounds of this broken country, one small business at a time.
But it was this process of evangelism that led me to obtain a different gospel, which I am going to share with you today.
It started one night about a year ago, when we attended the Harvard Business School alumni dinner at the Museum of Natural Science in New York.
Beneath a full-scale model of a whale, I sit side by side with the giants of our time, who sing the praises of their companions and their deeds.
There was an air of pride in the room. The total assets under these people&#39;s names exceeded 500 billion US dollars.
We look down at all creation and feel that it is good.
But that&#39;s what happened. Two days later, I went to Harlem, New York. I sat in an urban farm, which was an abandoned parking lot, and listened to a man named Tony talk about some children. Everyone will go there.
All of them are below the poverty line.
Many people carry all their belongings in backpacks for fear of being stolen in shelters.
Some people come to Tony&#39;s farm, called &quot;Grown in Harlem,&quot; to get their only meal a day.
Tony told me that he started Grow in Harlem with his own pension. He had been a taxi driver for 20 years.
He said he didn&#39;t keep a penny for himself because although the project was considered a success, resources were still extremely scarce.
He said he would accept any help he could find.
And I was there to help him.
But when I left Tony, I felt a sting in my heart and tears moistened the corners of my eyes.
I feel the burden of enlightenment. One night I can be sitting in a room talking to hundreds of people worth half a trillion dollars about the wonderful world, and then two days later I&#39;m in another room, only 50 blocks away, with an unpaid person. Men are expected to provide their children with their only meal every day.
But it wasn&#39;t the glaring social inequality that brought tears to my eyes. It wasn&#39;t the hungry, homeless children. It wasn&#39;t the anger for the 1%, or the pity for the 99%.
No, I couldn&#39;t calm down because I finally realized that this country needed a radical change, and I was just tinkering with it.
I realized that my story represented a group of people who were expected to be able to fend for themselves, even if they were broke; that my organization represented all the basic, systematic help that never reached Harlem or Aba. The Hill Country and the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans; my screams represent voices that sound meaningless, unpolished, and out of place.
And this shame, this shame washed over me, just like the shame I felt sitting in front of the TV, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, over and over and over.
I was fooled, cajoled, beguiled,
But this time, the hypocritical savior was myself.
You know, I have come all the way from that altar, that night I thought the world was going to end, from a small town where all dialects are spoken, thinking that suffering is a gift from God to mankind, and treating it as a creed, when Be the eternal truth.
Yes, my journey was so long that I came all the way back to where I started.
Because we cannot simply generalize and say that there is no faith in this era. No, we believe something just as much as ever.
Some may believe the predictions of Brene Brown or Tony Robbins. We might believe the maxims of The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We may believe deeply in what we worship in TED&#39;s church, but we desperately want to believe, and we need faith.
We imitate the words and deeds of charismatic leaders who promise to solve all of humanity&#39;s problems.
We feel that suffering is a gift given to us by the &quot;God&quot; of capitalism, and we regard the development of science and technology as a creed and an eternal truth.
But we never realize the human cost we pay. We won&#39;t question a brick because we&#39;re afraid the whole building will collapse.
But if you feel uneasy about the unnatural things we take for granted, the time for questioning will surely come.
So the gospel I preach is not about breakthroughs, innovations, or sustainable development.
I don’t even have the gospel of faith to share with you.
All I have is the gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not ask you to stop believing, it asks you to believe something new: &quot;It is possible not to believe.&quot;
It&#39;s possible that the answers we know are wrong, and it&#39;s possible that the question itself is wrong.
Yes, the gospel of doubt can mean that our existence, on this stage, in this room, is all wrong.
Because it begs the question: &quot;Why?&quot;
With so much power in our hands, why are there still people in dire straits?
This questioning led me to make the decision that the organization I founded, MBAs Across America, would cease operations.
We&#39;ve laid off our staff, closed our doors, and opened this model up to anyone, as long as they feel they have the ability to do it, without our approval.
This kind of questioning forces me to take off the &quot;savior&quot; hat that others put on my head, because our life is too short and the probability is too low to wait for the second coming of Christ. The fact is that there are no miracles in this world.
And this questioning, it drives me, it gives me hope, when difficulties threaten to crush us, when the path of destiny seems to lead us astray, when our savior cannot heal the wound, it is not our blind faith, but It is our simple questioning that will shed a little light into the darkness of our lives and the world. Let us speak softly,
You can just scream, or simply say, very simply: &quot;There must be another way.&quot;
Thanks.
Food crisis.
Appear in the daily news.
what is that?
There are places in the world where food is scarce and there are places where food is abundant.
In some places, genetically modified foods have saved the world.
Maybe GMOs are a problem?
Too much genetically modified agricultural wastewater has created polluted oceans, toxic seawater, and poor nutrition.
The cycle continues like this.
I find that today’s discussion is so uninfluential.
How do we make this discussion understandable?
What about the apple food crisis?
I&#39;m sure every one of you has eaten an apple in the past week.
How long do you think it took for the apples to reach your hands?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months -- that&#39;s the average time it takes for apples sold in U.S. malls to go from harvest to sale.
I think it should be pretty much the same in Europe and everywhere in the world.
We pick the apples, keep them refrigerated, pump oxygen into the freezers - and there are actually documented cases of workers trying to go into this environment to retrieve an apple, and then dying because of being in a freezer in this environment. The air in the cold storage is toxic to humans.
Why don&#39;t any of you know about this?
Why didn&#39;t I know about this?
90% of the nutrients in apples - all the antioxidants in apples - are lost when we buy them.
It&#39;s just a little candy.
Why don&#39;t we know this information? How to improve this situation?
I think we are missing a platform.
I know the platform -- I know how to use a computer, I&#39;ve been around the Internet since I was very young.
I&#39;ve done a lot of really weird stuff -- on a platform like this.
But I also met other people and I was able to express myself.
What is your opinion on food?
If we had a platform, we might find it very helpful to ask &quot;What if?&quot;
I want to ask: What if climate was democratic?
This is a global climate distribution map.
The most productive agricultural areas are green, the least productive are red.
They keep changing, changing, and California farmers now become Mexican farmers.
China acquires Brazilian land to grow better food, and we are all slaves to the environment.
What if every country has its own climate suitable for production?
How would that change our lives?
How will that change the quality of our lives and nutrition?
The problem for previous generations was that we needed more food and at a cheaper price.
Welcome to World Farm.
We built a giant simulated farm.
These line trajectories -- are cars, planes, trains and automobiles.
It is a miracle that we can provide enough food to feed 7 billion people, when only a few people are involved in the food production process.
but if...
We build a digital farm?
Digital world farm.
What if you could take this apple, digitize it in some way, transport it through a particle in the air, and then reassemble it on the other side?
if?
Look at these quotes, you know, they encouraged me to do this.
Article 1: &quot;Japanese agriculture has no young people, no water, no land, and no future.&quot; This was the day I arrived in Minamisanriku Town, one stop further south of Fukushima, after the nuclear power plant accident.
The children went to Sendai and Tokyo, the land was contaminated by the nuclear power plant accident, and they imported 70% of their food.
But this is not a phenomenon unique to Japan.
Only 2% of the U.S. population is employed in agriculture-related jobs.
What answer does it give us that 2% of the population is engaged in agriculture?
If we look elsewhere in the world, 50% of Africa&#39;s population is under 18 years old.
80% of them do not want to become farmers.
Farming is too hard.
Life as a small farmer is too hard.
They choose to go to the city.
In India: Farmers&#39; families are unable to access the most basic farm equipment, and more farmers are committing suicide than in the past 10 years.
It’s so sad to talk about this.
Where are they going?
Go to the city.
There are no young people. Young people have all gone to the cities.
So what kind of platform should we build to encourage young people?
Please look at this new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago, I went to a home furnishing chain store to start looking for tools.
I&#39;ve made silly things where I made plants dance and connected them to my computer and then I destroyed them -- a lot.
I finally kept them alive.
I created one of the most intimate relationships in my life because I learned the language of plants the most.
I want them to grow bigger.
They say, “Kid, go for it!
This electronics studio that no one uses.
What can you do? &quot;
Together with our team members, we built a farm in the Media Lab, a place that used to be associated with electronic life rather than living things.
In this 60 square meter space, we made enough rations to feed about 300 people for a month - not too much.
There&#39;s a lot of interesting technology here.
The funniest thing?
Beautiful, white rhizomes, dark green plants are harvested once a month.
Is this a new restaurant?
Is this a new sales experience?
Is this a new type of store?
What I know for sure is this: For the first time, any plant can be uprooted in a media lab.
We bagged the salad; nothing wrong with it.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, a robotics expert, uproot the plant and think, &quot;Well, I know something about -- I can make this happen, and I want to give it a try.&quot;
Throughout the process we&#39;ll take the plants out and bring some back to the lab, because if you grew it yourself, you wouldn&#39;t throw it away; because it&#39;s precious to you.
I have this weird tongue right now because I don&#39;t want anyone to eat them before me and I want it to be delicious.
I eat lettuce every day. Can I tell that the pH of lettuce is less than 1?
I&#39;m now like, &quot;No, that&#39;s 6.1 -- no no you can&#39;t eat it today.&quot;
(Applause) This lettuce was very sweet that day.
That&#39;s because the lettuce feels a lot of pressure and produces a chemical reaction to protect itself: &quot;I don&#39;t want to die!&quot;
The plant’s want-to-die flavor tastes sweet.
Scientists are back to studying plant physiology.
I think everyone can try to participate.
We look forward to seeing what everyone creates, so we envisioned a lab that could be transported to other locations.
Create such an idea.
The front of this media experimental building is my laboratory, and each plant has 30 sensing points.
If you understand the genome or genetics, this is the phenotype, right?
Phenomena represented by phenotypic groups.
When you say, &quot;I like strawberries from Mexico,&quot; what you really like are strawberries grown in that climate.
You can code that climate -- how much carbon dioxide, how much oxygen to create a recipe -- and you can programmatically control the presentation of the plant, and the nutrient content, the size, shape, color and texture of the plant.
We need data, so we put in a lot of sensors to provide us with data.
You can think back to the plants in your home. You look at the plants in your home and you feel sad because you think, &quot;Why are you dead? Are you going to talk to me?&quot;
Farmers have the most beautiful eyes that can predict the future. When they are sixty or seventy years old,
They can tell you that the plant died because the soil was deficient in nitrogen, calcium deficient, or it needed a more humid air environment.
These beautiful eyes are not passed down.
These are the eyes of farmers.
We will continue to collect data information.
We combine these data points with individual plants.
These are the IP addresses of all the cauliflowers in my lab that day.
We have cauliflower that tracks IP addresses.
(Applause) If that&#39;s not weird enough, you can click here to see an archive of the plant.
This shows you the downloadable growth of that plant, not just what you imagined, but not just notifies you when it&#39;s ready to eat.
When will its nutrients meet my needs?
When does it taste what I expect?
Is there too much water?
Has it been in the sun for too long?
Will be prompted.
It can talk to me, it can communicate, we can have language conversations.
(Applause) I think that was the first plant Facebook user, right?
That&#39;s when the plants&#39; archives plants will start making friends.
I&#39;m serious -- plants will start to make friends with plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We will begin to understand complex things that now can only be guessed at.
They may not be friendly to us -- I don&#39;t know, maybe they will be friendly to us, depending on how we behave.
This is my current lab.
It&#39;s a little more systematic, and my background is designing hospital data centers, and I know how to create a controlled environment.
So -- in this environment, we experiment with all kinds of things.
This process, aeroponics, was developed by NASA for the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water they need to send into space.
What this program does is give the plants exactly what they want. water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots are not that complicated, and when you feed these, you can see amazing results.
Plants have two hearts.
Because it has two hearts, it shows rapid growth of 4-5 times.
This is a perfect world.
We&#39;ve gone through a long period of technological development looking for a different world, and we&#39;ll continue to do that, but we&#39;ll also have new tools, and that would be a perfect world.
We grow all kinds of things.
None of these tomatoes have been produced commercially for the past 150 years.
Did you know we have a rare, vintage seed bank?
Seed bank.
This is awesome.
They have living germplasm that you haven&#39;t eaten.
I&#39;m the only one in the room who&#39;s ever eaten this tomato.
The problem is, these are tomatoes in sauce. We don’t know how to cook them, so tomatoes in sauce don’t seem to taste good.
But we have grown all kinds of things that contain protein.
We&#39;ve grown humans -- maybe you can, but we can&#39;t.
We realized that the tool was too big and too expensive.
I started placing them around the world worth about $100,000.
It&#39;s not easy to find people with $100,000 at their disposal, so we wanted to make small tools.
This is actually a project of one of my students -- mechanical engineering undergraduate, Kamil
Camille and I, and my team, we spent the summer iterating on how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, how to make it accessible to others.
We then send these tools to schools for children in grades 7 to 11.
If you want to be humble, try teaching your children how to do it.
I went to this school and said, &quot;Set its humidity to 65%.&quot;
A kid in 7th grade asked, &quot;What humidity?&quot;
So I said, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s water in the air.&quot;
He said, &quot;There&#39;s no water in the air, you idiot.&quot;
So I said, “Well, don’t believe me.
In fact -- don&#39;t believe me, right?
Set it to 100.
He sets the humidity to 100. What happens?
Condensation begins, creating mist, and eventually water begins to drip.
Then he said, &quot;Oh, the humidity is rain.
Why didn&#39;t you tell me this before? &quot;
The interface we created looks like a game.
They have 3D environments that can be accessed from mobile phones and computers from anywhere in the world.
There are different parts in the program - physical adjustments, sensors.
They chose recipes that children in other parts of the world had already created.
They select and activate recipes and plant seeds.
As the seeds grow, children can make changes.
They said, &quot;Why do plants need carbon dioxide? Isn&#39;t carbon dioxide a bad thing?&quot;
It can make people suffocate. &quot;
Increase the supply of carbon dioxide and the plant dies.
Reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and plants live well.
Harvesting plants, you create new electronic recipes.
This is an iterative process of design, development and exploration.
They can download all the data for a new plant they develop, or a new electronic recipe. What does it do -- is it better or worse?
Imagine these are the core elements of processing.
We can learn a lot.
This was what we called a food computer, and it was placed in a school for three weeks.
This is three weeks of planting.
More importantly, for the first time, the kid thought he could be a farmer -- or that he wanted to be a farmer.
So we make these resources public.
Put it all online; go home and try to build your first food computer.
It&#39;s going to be hard -- I tell you this.
We&#39;re in the early stages, but the resources are there.
It&#39;s very important to me that these are easily accessible.
We will continue to do so.
These are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, city planners.
On one platform, do what they are good at.
The team becomes too big.
This is my new experimental equipment starting to work.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
That&#39;s why I chose it.
In this warehouse we are going to build a shelf like this.
You can see it now.
Take a look at this,
This also exists.
One grows green vegetables, and the other grows Ebola virus vaccines.
The great thing is, plants and this DARPA winning project are the reason why we are so successful in studying Ebola.
The plants are producing proteins that fight the Ebola virus.
So medicines and supplements, to lettuce growing.
But those two things look completely different, and that&#39;s my part of the field.
But many things are not as imagined.
We were still in the &quot;we&#39;re right&quot; stage where we were like, &quot;Here&#39;s my little black box--&quot; &quot;No, buy mine.&quot;
&quot;No, no, no -- my intellectual property is absolutely valuable.
Don&#39;t buy this, buy mine. &quot;
The fact is that we are only in the beginning stage, and society is also changing at this time.
While we want more, cheaper food, we now need better quality, environmentally friendly food.
But when you see McDonald&#39;s advertising the ingredients in Chicken McNuggets, the most mysterious food in human history -- McDonald&#39;s marketing plan is changing -- everything is changing.
Now look at the world today.
Personal food computers, food servers, food data centers, operate on public phenotypic groups.
It&#39;s like making the genome public, but we&#39;re putting together little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can knock over, turn on, plant.
How does this look?
Do you remember the world is connected by strings?
The bacon is starting to appear.
Instead of handing out food, we started sending messages about food.
This is not just my fantasy, this is work we are already doing.
Food computers, food servers, and soon food data centers connect people together to share information.
The future of food is not its mistake to fight for,
We all know what&#39;s wrong.
The future of food is about connecting the next generation of one billion farmers and empowering them with a Q&amp;A platform, “What if?”
Thanks.
Sometimes I feel very ashamed to be a European
Over a million people arrived in Europe last year needing our help and our response was frankly pathetic
There are so many contradictions here
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Cody, but since then more than two hundred children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international conventions that recognize that hosting refugees is a shared responsibility among all countries, yet we accept that tiny Lebanon takes in more Syrians than the whole of Europe.
We decry the existence of human smuggling yet we make it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe
We have a labor shortage and yet we prevent those who could meet our economic and demographic needs from entering Europe
We claim that our liberal values are contrary to those espoused by Islamic fundamentalists. Yet - we use repressive policies to detain child asylum seekers, separate children from their families, and forcibly confiscate refugee property.
What are we doing
How did the situation get to this point? We are responding to a humanitarian crisis in an inhumane way.
I don&#39;t believe it because people don&#39;t care. At least I don&#39;t want to believe it.
I think this is due to a lack of foresight on the part of our politicians to adapt to a changing and globalized world that was proposed fifty years ago.
The International Refugee System So what I want to do is take a step back and ask two very basic questions that we all have to understand.
First of all why the existing system doesn’t work
Secondly, how do we solve
The modern refugee system was developed after World War II by these people
Its original intention was to ensure that when a country collapsed, or worse, a regime became hostile to its people, those people had a place to go and live there in safety and dignity until they could return home.
This is exactly what we are seeing in Syria today
Through the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, an international conference signed by 147 governments, and an international organization, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), commitments are made to member states to allow entry into their territories for people fleeing conflict, conflict and persecution.
But now the system is collapsing
Refugees have the theoretical right to seek asylum
The reality is that our immigration policies block this path to safety
Refugees theoretically have the right to seek equal treatment or the option to return to their home country
But in practice they are stuck in an almost indefinite state of stagnation.
Theoretically, the refugee problem is the responsibility of all countries.
In practice, geographical location means that countries close to conflict are overloaded with receiving the vast majority of refugees.
The rules of the original refugee system were not the cause of its collapse
It&#39;s that we haven&#39;t used it enough as the world changes. That&#39;s what we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain to you how the system works today
How does the current refugee admission system work?
But this is not from a top-down macro perspective but from the perspective of individual refugees.
So imagine a Syrian woman
Let&#39;s call her Amira
Amira represents the many refugees I meet in the region
Amira, like about a quarter of the world&#39;s refugees, is a woman with a child. She cannot return home because her city, which you see now in Homs, once a beautiful and historic city, is now devastated.
So Amira can&#39;t go back
Amira also has no hope of resettling in a third country because that would be like winning the lottery, something only less than one percent of refugees in the world can win.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice
They have three basic options
The first one is that Amira can take her family to the refugee camp
She might get help in the refugee camp but the prospects for Amira and her family are very slim.
The camp is located in a desolate and barren area, usually a desert
At the Za&#39;atalina camp in Jordan you can hear the sound of shells coming across the Syrian border at night
Economic activity there is restricted
The quality of education is often low
And about 80% of refugees in refugee camps around the world have to stay there for at least five years.
This is where the tragedy lies, which may also explain why in reality only nine percent of Syrians choose this option
Or Amira can travel to a city area in a neighboring city such as Amman or Beirut
Seventy-five percent of Syrian refugees choose this option
But even there it was difficult
Refugees in cities often do not have the right to work
They often have no access to assistance
So when Amira and her family used up their basic savings, they had little left and were likely to face poverty.
There is a third option being chosen by an increasing number of Syrians
Amira can seek hope for her family by embarking on a dangerous journey to another country that could cost her life. This is what we see in Europe today.
Globally we are left with an almost impossible choice for refugees. Among these three options are refugee camps, cities, poverty and dangerous journeys.
For refugees this option is today’s global refugee regime
But I think this is a wrong choice
I think we can revisit this option
The reason we limit these options is because we think these are the only options available to refugees but they are not
Politicians have framed it as a matter of gains and losses. If refugees gain, citizens have to bear the loss.
We seem to agree with the assumption that refugees are an inevitable burden and cost to society
But this is not a stereotype refugees can contribute
So what I want to demonstrate is that we have ways to increase that option and still benefit everyone: including host countries and communities, our society, and the refugees themselves
I would like to propose four ways to transform our established thinking about refugees
What these four approaches have in common is that we have taken advantage of the opportunities of globalization, social mobility and markets to update our understanding of refugee issues.
The first thing I want to consider is the concept of creating environments. This comes from a very basic understanding that refugees are just like all other people; they are just in a certain environment.
My colleagues at the University of Oxford and I have begun a research project in Uganda examining the economic lives of refugees
We did not choose Uganda because it is a typical example of a receiving country
it is exactly an exception
Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda does is give refugees economic opportunities.
Give them the right to work and give them freedom of movement
The consequences are staggering, both for refugees and for host countries.
In Kampala, the capital of Uganda, we found that 21 percent of refugees opened their own businesses and employed others, and 40 percent of those employed were nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for citizens of the host country.
Even in refugee camps we found examples of dynamic, thriving entrepreneurial businesses
For example, in a refugee camp called Nakiwale we found Congolese refugees running a business trading digital music.
We found a Rwandan refugee business that allows young people to play computer games on recycled consoles and monitors
Refugees are constantly innovating despite extreme constraints. The person in front of you is a Congolese named Damon Kay.
He arrived at the refugee camp with little money but wanted to be a filmmaker
So with friends and colleagues he started a community radio station, he rented a video camera and he&#39;s now making movies
He has filmed two documentaries with and for our team and has built a successful career from very few resources.
It is precisely this kind of example that should dominate our response to refugees
Rather than assuming that refugees are inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid we need to provide them with opportunities to flourish as human beings
Yes, clothing, blankets, shelter, and food are all very important during the emergency phase, but we must also think long-term.
We need to provide connectivity, access to electricity, education, access to jobs, funding and business
All the access to the global economy that we take for granted can and should be made available to refugees
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones
Unfortunately not all host countries in the world have adopted Uganda’s policies
Most host economies are closed to refugees but we still have viable alternatives
Last April I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Corea, where we discussed an idea with the international community and the local government to bring jobs to Syrians while advancing Jordan&#39;s national development strategy.
The idea is to create an economic zone in which we can combine employment of refugees with employment of nationals of the host country Jordan
Just a 15-minute drive outside the Zaatari refugee camp, which houses 83,000 refugees, is an active economic zone known as the King Hussein Development Zone.
The government has invested more than $100 million to connect power grids and roads but it still lacks two things: labor and foreign investment.
So what if instead of being stuck in a refugee camp, refugees could work there and be able to support their families and develop their skills through vocational training before returning to Syria?
We recognize that doing so benefits Jordan as its national development strategy calls for upgrading manufacturing as a middle-income country
Doing so benefits refugees while also aiding Syria&#39;s post-war reconstruction by recognizing that we need to nurture refugees as the best resource for ultimately rebuilding Syria
We published this view in the journal Foreign Affairs
King Abdullah of Jordan also adopted the idea
It was announced two weeks ago at the London Syria Conference that the pilot project would begin this summer.
The third idea I want to show is the preference matching between countries and refugees in order to achieve this satisfying ending in this selfie photo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with a Syrian refugee
We rarely ask refugees what they want or where they want to go but I argue that it can be done while benefiting everyone
Economist Alvin Ross created the concept of a matching market, in which the order of preferences of both parties determines the final match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Eric Stateboy looked at how to apply this concept to the refugee problem. They asked refugees to rank their preferred countries but also allowed countries to rank the types of refugees they wanted to accept based on skills or language. The standard finally matches the two sortings
Of course you need to establish quotas in terms of diversity and vulnerability but this is a way to increase the likelihood of pairing
This matching concept has been used successfully, for example, to match students and universities to match kidney donors and patients. It also highlights the importance of algorithms in dating sites.
So why not apply it to give refugees better options?
The same applies to the national level where the biggest problem we face is convincing local communities to accept refugees.
Taking my country as an example, we often send engineers to remote areas and farmers to cities. It makes no sense at all.
So matching markets offer a potential way to match these preferences and reflect the needs and requirements of the people in the receiving countries as well as the refugees
My fourth idea is a humanitarian visa
Much of the tragedy and chaos we see in Europe is completely avoidable
This stems from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy: in order to seek asylum in Europe you have to make it to Europe on your own, taking a dangerous journey that I described earlier. But why are these journeys necessary?
In an era of low-cost airlines and consulates?
These were completely unnecessary journeys that led to the deaths of more than three thousand people at European borders and within Europe last year
We could avoid these deaths if refugees were able to travel directly to Europe and seek asylum. This is indeed possible through humanitarian visas, which allow people to pick up a visa at an embassy or consulate in a neighboring country and then pay their own way to Europe by cruise ship or plane.
It costs about a thousand euros to bring a stowaway from Turkey to the Greek Islands
It only costs 200 euros to fly from Bodrum, Turkey to Frankfurt, Germany with a low-cost airline
If we allow them to do this it will be extremely fruitful
This would save lives, eradicate the market for illegal immigrants and eliminate the chaos we see on the fringes of Europe in areas like the Greek Islands.
What&#39;s stopping us from implementing this is politics rather than rational solutions
and this is an idea that has been applied
Brazil was the first to adopt this policy. More than 2,000 Syrians were granted humanitarian visas to enter Brazil and were granted refugee status upon entry.
In that program every Syrian was granted refugee status and confirmed to be a genuine refugee
There is also a historical precedent
Between 1922 and 1942 these Nansen passports served as entry and exit documents allowing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to cross Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe
UNHCR Nansen wins Nobel Peace Prize for this viable response
So the four ideas I&#39;m showing you are all ways in which we can increase the options for Amira
Allowing refugees to have better options rather than just three basic, impossible options like I said before and still benefits everyone
Overall we need a fresh perspective to increase options for refugees while recognizing that they do not have to be a burden on society
It is not a fixed rule that refugees become a cost
Yes, refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they are also human beings with skills, talents and aspirations who have the ability to contribute to society - if we allow them to
Migration doesn&#39;t disappear in a new world
What we see in Europe will be there for many years
People will continue to move. People will still be displaced from their homes. We need to find a rational and realistic way to manage it - not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid. The old logic of humanitarian aid is not based on the logic of charity but on the opportunities that globalization, markets and mobility bring.
I hope everyone realizes this and I implore our government officials to rise to this challenge
Thank you everyone
As a child, I always fantasized about the ocean.
It is colorful and vibrant, with many animals that look like alien creatures living there.
I imagined the giant sharks at the top of the food chain and the turtles dancing gracefully among the coral reefs.
As a marine biologist turned photographer, I have spent much of my career seeking out places that haunted my childhood fantasies.
As you can see, I have been adventurous in the water since I was very young.
But the first time I actually dived into the water was when I was 10 years old.
I can still clearly remember paddling hard to reach a rusty cannon barrel lying on the coral reef.
Finally, I successfully reached the barrel. When I looked up, I found myself surrounded by fish. Fish of various colors, like a rainbow.
From that day on, I fell deeply in love with the ocean.
(Subtitle: Thomas Peschak) (Subtitle: Conservation Photographer) Over the past 40 years, I&#39;ve had the privilege of exploring some of the most incredible ocean landscapes on Earth, writing for National Geographic Magazine and the Save Our Oceans Foundation.
My subjects range from giant sharks to small enough to swim in the palm of your hand.
In the cold sea by the Great Bear Rainforest in Canada, I encountered a humpback whale feasting next to me. The fishy smell in its mouth was unforgettable.
In the Mozambique Channel, I saw the courtship ritual of green sea turtles.
Each of us affects the ocean and is affected by the ocean.
And the pure ocean I dreamed of when I was a child is becoming increasingly difficult to find.
Their range is shrinking and the threats they face are increasing.
We humans have always occupied a position at the top of the food chain on earth. I have witnessed these behaviors with my own eyes and recorded them with my camera.
For a long time, I thought that only shocking photos could wake up my audience.
Of course, this view also has advantages, that is, it brings me back to the original point.
I believe the best way to bring about change is to spread love.
I feel like I am a bridge between people and animals. As a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to uncover the mysteries of animals and ecosystems hidden in the depths of the ocean.
How can you love and protect something if you don&#39;t even know it exists?
And this is precisely the strength of our environmental photographers.
I have been to hundreds of different sea areas, but there are only a few sights that I will never forget.
The first time I was struck by such a scene was almost ten years ago, on the rugged and steep coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, countless sardines migrate northward, which we call the &quot;sardine tide.&quot;
Trust me, these fish have to do it.
Because there are hordes of hungry and agile hunters chasing behind.
For example, dolphins that hunt in groups separate some sardines from the school and gather them into balls.
Dolphins will drive these sardines closer to the sea surface and then rush into the fish to feast and enjoy this mobile feast.
Not far behind is the shark.
Most people would think that sharks and dolphins are natural enemies, but in the &quot;sardine tide&quot;, they coexist.
In fact, the shark eats more happily with the help of the dolphin.
Without the drive of dolphins, it is difficult for sardines to gather into balls. Sharks often pass through the middle of the school of fish, just like passing through donuts, and sometimes they can only drink a belly of water.
I had several close encounters with sharks during the Sardine Tide, and I knew the sharks didn&#39;t take me seriously.
But I kept getting bumped and tail-swept, just like the other guests at this raucous feast.
We sailed east from the African coastline, across the vast Indian Ocean, and arrived at the Maldives, an archipelago composed of coral reefs.
During the stormy southwest monsoon season, manta rays living in the archipelago waters will gather near a small island called Hanifaru in Baa Atoll.
Groups of small shrimps and crabs, most of which are smaller than our pupils, are the main food of manta rays.
When these plankton are dispersed, manta rays usually feed alone, rolling backwards in the water like puppies chasing their tails.
When more and more plankton gather, the manta rays begin to line up end to end, forming a long feeding formation. The delicious food missed by the manta ray at the head of the team will be swallowed up by the companions behind it.
As more and more plankton gather in the bay, the formations of manta rays also get closer and closer. This unique feeding method is what we call the &quot;whirlwind feeding method.&quot;
The manta rays are stacked on top of each other, rotating in a tight formation, forming a vortex, sucking in plankton, and sending them straight into the manta ray&#39;s huge mouth.
Diving among hundreds of manta rays is a sight I will never forget.
When I first went to take pictures in Hanifaru, the area had not yet been protected and the ecological environment was threatened by local development.
Working with NGOs such as the Manta Trust, my photos helped Hanifaru become a marine reserve.
Fishermen from nearby islands once killed many manta rays and used their skins to make traditional drums.
Today, they have become the staunchest protectors of the manta rays, which bring more than $8 million in revenue to the Maldives every year.
I&#39;ve always wanted to go back in time, to a time when most maps were blank, or marked &quot;Here is a dragon.&quot;
The most similar places I&#39;ve been to so far are some remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean.
It&#39;s far away from the fishing grounds and fishing boats, and diving there always makes me feel sad because it reminds me of what the ocean once looked like.
Few people have heard of India Cay, a tiny coral atoll located in the Mozambique Channel.
Its outer reefs form a protective barrier and the lagoon in the middle serves as a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, even during the day.
I guess they are more active at night and there are more of them.
I have never seen so many sharks in a coral lagoon before.
Recording and sharing moments like this - always reminds me why I chose this path in the first place.
Earlier this year, I traveled to the California peninsula to complete a contract shoot for National Geographic Magazine.
In the middle of the peninsula, on the side facing the Pacific Ocean, is the San Ignacio Lagoon, which is an important breeding ground for gray whales.
Over the past 100 years, this stretch of coastline has been a huge slaughterhouse, with more than 20,000 gray whales killed here, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Now, the descendants of these gray whales push their calves to the surface to play and even interact with us.
The species has made an astonishing recovery.
On the other side of the peninsula is Pulmo Point, a quiet little fishing village.
Decades of overfishing once brought the village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the government to list this area as a marine protected area.
What happened next was nothing short of miraculous.
In 2005, after just 10 years of protection, scientists discovered that local fish populations had recovered in record numbers.
Seeing is believing, come with me.
Take a deep breath and dive with me to the bottom of the sea to see what the largest, densest school of fish I have ever encountered looks like.
We all have the ability to create hope.
Through my photos, I want to send a message that it is not too late to save the ocean from now on.
I particularly want to focus on nature&#39;s resilience in the face of 7.3 billion humans.
I hope that in the future, it will become increasingly difficult for me to take photos like this, and instead I will take more photos that reflect the harmonious coexistence of people and the ocean.
I wish I could take photos like this every day.
To make it in our business, you have to be a hopeless optimist.
I always take pictures with the assumption that the next great photo that will make a difference is waiting for me, maybe behind the next coral reef, in the next lagoon, or maybe the next one.
When I moved to Harare in 1985 social justice issues were at the heart of Zimbabwe&#39;s national health policy
The new government immediately announced a socialist policy after emerging from the long war of independence: making health care services and primary education basically free projects
Large-scale rural health services are within two hours&#39; walk of 80% of the population. This is truly extraordinary progress.
In 1980, the year of Zimbabwe’s independence, 25% of children were routinely immunized
By 1990, just ten years later this proportion had risen to 80%
I am honored to be a part of this transformation, this revolution
The excitement and camaraderie are very real.
Working side by side with the remarkable people, scientists, doctors, and activists of Zimbabwe, I felt part of not just an African independence movement but a progressive global public health movement.
I&#39;ve also faced some daunting difficulties
In 1985, the year I arrived, the first case of AIDS was reported in Zimbabwe.
I cared for several AIDS patients in the early 1980s while I was doing my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but... we had no idea what we were going to encounter in Africa.
When I first got there, the infection rate was about 2%
This ratio increased rapidly. By the time I left Harare 17 years later, one in four adults was infected.
By the mid-1990s I was telling hundreds of young, energetic people that they had tested positive for HIV.
I watched my colleagues and friends die, my students and hospital patients died.
Faced with this situation, my colleagues and I opened a clinic
We demonstrate how to use condoms
We promote in schools, education and workplaces
We conduct research and we provide advice to partners of people living with HIV on how to protect themselves.
We worked very hard to do all this and I believe I did my best at that time
I provided the best possible treatment, at least under the circumstances.
But I didn&#39;t make constructive changes
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan once frankly admitted that it was his personal mistakes that led to the Rwanda genocide.
In 1994, he was the head of the United Nations peacekeeping department
At the 10th anniversary of the Holocaust, he recalled that at the time I believed I had done all I could, but after the Holocaust I realized there was much more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and seek support.
The AIDS outbreak has caught the medical community off guard. The World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people are dying from the disease today. Many, like me, feel remorse and regret for not stopping it earlier.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe I didn’t realize I was an advocate or a politician
I thought I went there because of my medical knowledge but because of my clinical and infectious disease research
I have always felt that my job was to care for patients through research to better understand the demographic characteristics of infection in hopes of slowing the spread of the virus.
I realized that marginalized groups in society contract and die from AIDS at surprisingly high rates
In places like sugar plantations, which resemble feudal fiefdoms more than modern enterprises, 60% of pregnant women test positive for HIV
My job is to show people that being infected is not about moral failings but about patriarchal consciousness, forced migrant labor and colonialism.
White people are mostly safe.
As medical professionals we are sadly powerless: imploring people to change their personal behavior to use condoms and reduce the number of partners they have
Infection rates are still climbing. As our most effective weapon against the virus becomes available in the West, treatment is unaffordable for the public sector across Africa.
I am not bold enough to say that unequal access to life-saving medicines or problems in the underlying economic and political systems are the driving forces behind such high infection rates across such large swaths of the population.
I excused my silence by reminding myself that I was only a visitor to this country, a warning that I might be deported and that I would be unable to do my job, care for my patients, and do desperately needed research.
So I wasn&#39;t very vocal about the government&#39;s early AIDS policies.
I express my concerns loudly enough
Many doctors and health care workers may feel that I have done nothing wrong
Our commitment to our patients is as sacrosanct as the Hippocratic Oath and its different versions, the doctor-patient relationship.
I do my best for each of my patients
But I know that the infectious diseases that accompany the divisions in our society reflect not only biological phenomena, but more importantly, phenomena of marginalization, intolerance, racial discrimination, sexism, and class discrimination.
This is true for AIDS
This is true for the recent Ebola
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmar, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, call structural violence: Structural, because the inequalities embedded in the political and economic organization of our social environment are often invisible to the privileged and regime classes; violence , because its effects such as early death, suffering, disease, are violent
We can do very little for our patients if we are not aware of these social injustices
Sounding the alarm is the first step in steering public health care in the right direction. It’s how we find support, break through together, and create real change.
So now, I am not keeping silent
I speak out about many things even if it makes the listener uncomfortable even if it makes me uncomfortable
A lot of it is about segregation and organized racism, things that should not happen in this country and should not exist in the practice of medicine or in public health care.
But they do exist and we pay the price of shortening our lives
This is why alarm bells are ringing in the United States about the impact of racism on health care. The ongoing, organized, interpersonal violence against people of color is tied to our tragic history of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of racial discrimination, and 60 years of racial discrimination. Imperfect equality and raising alarm bells about this is a focus of my work as New York City’s health commissioner.
In New York City, premature mortality, defined as death before age 65, is 50 percent higher for blacks than for whites
In 2012, black women faced 10 times the risk of childbirth-related death compared to white women
Despite the tremendous progress we have made in reducing infant mortality, black infants still die at nearly three times the rate of white infants in the first year of life.
New York City is not unique
These statistics are similar across the United States
A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are approximately 15 million missing black men nationwide.
The author points out that at least one out of every six black men between the ages of 25 and 54 disappears from daily life, is imprisoned, or dies prematurely.
It’s deeply unfair that young black people face disproportionate violence on a daily basis. This is reflected in recent protests with “Black Lives Matter” signs.
But we need to remember the current state of affairs and outcomes in general medical care, and the persistent and disproportionately high rates of disease, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, diseases that slowly and quietly consume lives and take more black lives prematurely.
As the Black Lives Matter movement unfolds, I feel frustrated and irritated that the medical community is hesitant to even use the word &quot;racist&quot; in its research and work.
Every time I say it, you probably already feel it
Medical students wear white robes and die in protest against bioweapons But the medical community has largely stood aside in the face of the impact of continued racial discrimination on disease status and mortality
I&#39;m concerned that the trend toward personalized and precise medicine, looking at biological and genetic targets to better design treatments, may inadvertently distract us from looking at the big picture, which is how everyday people live, grow, work, and love. Places matter and influence group health. For many of us, ill health
In our daily lives, as health care workers, in clinics and in research, we are witnesses to great injustices: homeless people, unable to follow medical advice because they have more pressing priorities; young transgender people, Planning suicide, because our society is too heartless; Single mother, being forced to feel responsible for her child&#39;s ill health.
As health care workers, our role is not only to treat our patients but also to sound the alarm and advocate for change.
Whether justified or not, our social positions give our voices credibility and we shouldn&#39;t waste it.
I regret not being able to speak out in Zimbabwe. I have made a commitment to myself that as New York City’s health care commissioner I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and build support for health care equality.
I&#39;m going to speak out against racism, and I hope you&#39;ll join me and I&#39;ll join you when you speak out against sexism, or any kind of inequality.
It’s time for us to rise up and collectively speak out against structural inequality
We don’t need to have all the answers to advocate for change
All we need is courage
The health of our patients and our own health all depend on this
Okay, I&#39;d like to show you guys a show of hands, how many of you have blocked a friend on Facebook because they made inappropriate comments about politics, religion, children&#39;s rights, or food?
How many of you have at least one person you don&#39;t want to see because you just don&#39;t want to talk to them?
You know, in the past, to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow Henry Higgins&#39; advice in My Fair Lady: just talk about the weather and your health.
But in recent years, with climate change and the anti-vaccination movement - this strategy is no longer effective.
So it&#39;s not normal that we live in a world where every conversation has the potential to turn into an argument, where politicians can&#39;t talk to each other, and where there are passionate arguments for and against even trivial things.
The Pew Research Center conducted a survey of 10,000 American adults and found that the degree to which we are now more extreme and the degree to which we take a clear stand is higher than at any time in history.
We&#39;re less inclined to compromise, which means we&#39;re not listening to each other.
The decisions we make, from where to live to who to marry to who to be friends with, are all based solely on the beliefs we already have.
Again, this shows that we are not listening to each other.
Conversation requires a balance between telling and listening, and somehow we lose that balance.
Technological advances are partly to blame.
For example, smartphones are in your hands right now, or they are right next to you and are easily accessible.
According to Pew research, about one-third of American teens send more than a hundred text messages a day.
And a lot of people, almost all of them, are more likely to text their friends than talk face to face.
There was a great article in The Atlantic magazine,
The author is high school teacher Paul Barnwell.
He gave his students a communication task,
The hope is to teach them how to give a speech on a topic without the aid of notes.
Then he said, &quot;I started to realize...&quot;
“I started to realize that communication skills are probably the most overlooked and not taught skill that we have the most.
Children spend hours a day interacting with creatives and other peers through screens, but rarely have the opportunity to develop their interpersonal skills. &quot;
It sounds funny, but we have to ask ourselves: What skill is more important in the 21st century than maintaining a coherent, confident conversation? &quot;
Now, my career is talking to people. Nobel Prize winner, truck driver, billionaire, kindergarten teacher, governor, plumber.
I talk to people I like and I talk to people I don&#39;t like.
I talk to people who I deeply disagree with on a personal level.
But I still have great communication with them.
So I want to spend the next 10 minutes teaching you how to talk, and how to listen.
Many of you have heard countless tips, such as looking the other person in the eye, thinking of interesting topics to discuss in advance, looking, nodding, and smiling to show you&#39;re paying attention, repeating what you just heard, or summarizing.
I want you to forget all this,
All in vain.
There is no need to learn how to show that you are paying attention, if you really are paying attention.
I actually use the same skills as a professional interviewer in my daily life.
Okay, I&#39;m going to teach you how to interview people, which will actually help you learn how to become better communicators.
Learn to start a conversation without wasting time, without getting bored, and, most importantly, without offending anyone.
We all had great conversations.
We&#39;ve all been there. We know what that feels like.
The kind of conversation that makes you feel very enjoyable and inspired after it ends, or makes you feel that you have established a real connection with others, or makes you completely understood by others.
There’s no reason why most of your human interactions can’t be like that.
I have 10 basic rules. I&#39;ll explain it to you piece by piece, but seriously, if you pick one and master it, you&#39;ll already be on your way to having more enjoyable conversations.
Rule 1: Don’t be half-hearted.
I’m not talking about simply putting down your phone, tablet, car keys, or whatever else is in your hand.
I mean, be in the moment.
Get into that situation.
Don&#39;t dwell on your previous arguments with your boss.
Don&#39;t think about what you&#39;re going to have for dinner.
If you want to leave the conversation, leave the conversation. But don&#39;t be in Cao&#39;s camp and your heart is in Han.
Article 2: Don’t be a teacher.
If you want to express your opinion without leaving any opportunity for response, debate, rebuttal or elaboration, blog about it.
There&#39;s a good reason why I don&#39;t allow &quot;expert preaching&quot; in my talks: because it&#39;s boring.
If the other person is a conservative, they must hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If the other party is a liberal, he will hate the big banks, the oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
Totally predictable.
You definitely don&#39;t want that.
You need to go into every interaction assuming you can learn something.
The famous therapist M. Scott Pike said that true listening requires putting yourself aside.
Sometimes, that means putting your personal opinions aside.
He said that feeling this kind of acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and sensitive, and therefore more and more likely to open up his inner world and present it to the listener.
Again, assume you need to learn something new.
Bill Nye said: “Every person you are going to meet has something you don’t know.”
Let me rephrase it: Everyone is an expert in something.
Tip #3: Use open-ended questions.
Regarding this, please refer to the reporter’s interview question format.
Start the question with &quot;who&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;where&quot;, &quot;why&quot; or &quot;how&quot;.
If you ask a complex question you will get a simple answer.
If I ask you, &quot;Were you afraid?&quot;
You will respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, &quot;fear,&quot; and the answer will be &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot;
&quot;Were you angry at the time?&quot; &quot;Yes, I was very angry at the time.&quot;
Let the other person describe it. The other person is the one who understands the situation.
Try asking the person: &quot;What does that look like?&quot;
&quot;how are you feeling?&quot;
Because in this way, the other person may need to stop and think about it, and you will get a more interesting answer.
Point 4: Let nature take its course.
That is, ideas will naturally flow into your mind, and you need to express them.
We often hear the guest in the interview talk for a few minutes, and then the host comes back to ask a question, which seems to come from nowhere or has already been answered.
This shows that the host may not have been listening two minutes ago, because he thought of this very clever question, so he was thinking about asking this question.
We will do the same.
As we were sitting and talking with someone, we suddenly remembered that chance encounter with Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
Then we stopped listening.
Stories and ideas will always come to you,
But even if you can&#39;t stop them, don&#39;t let them linger in your mind too much.
Point 5: If you don’t know, just say you don’t know.
People on radio, especially on National Public Radio, know full well that what they say is going to be broadcast. So they are more careful about where they claim expertise and what they say.
Learn to do this. Be careful what you say and do.
Talking should be responsible behavior.
Article 6: Don’t compare your experiences with others.
If the other person talks about losing a family member, don&#39;t jump right into talking about your loss.
If the person is talking about troubles at work, don&#39;t tell them how much you hate your job.
This is different, it can never be the same.
Every experience is unique.
And, more importantly, it&#39;s not about you.
You don&#39;t need to prove how capable you are or how much pain you endured right now.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was, and he replied: &quot;I don&#39;t know. Anyone who brags about their IQ is a loser.&quot;
Conversation is not about selling yourself.
Rule 7: Try not to repeat yourself.
It&#39;s aggressive and boring. But it is easy for us to do so.
Especially in conversations at work, or with kids. We want to make a point, so we keep saying it in different ways.
do not do that.
Article 8: Stop talking nonsense.
To put it bluntly, no one cares about the years, names, dates, and all the other details you are trying to remember in your mind.
Others don&#39;t care. They focus on you.
The other person cares about who you are and what they have in common with you.
So forget about the details. Leave them alone.
Article 9: This is not the last article, but the most important one.
Listen carefully.
I can&#39;t tell you how many important people have said that listening is probably the most important, number one skill you can improve.
Buddha said - and I paraphrase, &quot;If you don&#39;t stop talking, you won&#39;t learn anything.&quot;
Calvin Coolidge once said: “No one was ever fired for listening to too much.”
Why don’t we listen to each other?
First, we prefer to say.
I am in control as I speak.
I don’t have to listen to anything that doesn’t interest me.
I am the focus.
I can strengthen my sense of identity.
But there&#39;s another reason: we get disrupted.
The average person speaks about 225 words per minute, but we can listen to nearly 500 words per minute.
So our brains are occupied with these other 275 words.
I know it takes a lot of energy to really pay attention to what someone else is saying. But if you don&#39;t, you&#39;re not having a conversation.
You are just two people in the same place shouting unrelated things to each other.
You must listen to each other.
Stephen Covey writes brilliantly about this.
&quot;Most of us don&#39;t listen to understand,&quot; he said.
We listen in order to respond. &quot;
The last one, No. 10: Be concise and to the point.
&quot;A good conversation is like a miniskirt that&#39;s just right; short enough to be engaging, yet long enough to contain the subject - my sister&#39;s metaphor.&quot; All of this boils down to the same concept, which is: taking an interest in other people.
I grew up with a famous grandpa, and I had a lot of guests in my house.
Visitors would come and talk to my grandparents, and after those people left, my mother would come up to us and say, &quot;Do you know who that is?
She was the first runner-up to Miss America.
He is the mayor of Sacramento.
She won the Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer. &quot;
I grew up with the acquiescence that everyone has hidden wonderful things.
Seriously, I think it all makes me a better presenter.
I try to talk as little as possible, but keep my mind open, and always be prepared to be surprised, and I am never disappointed.
You can do the same.
Get out there, talk to people, listen to people, and most importantly, prepare to be surprised.
Thanks.
Hello everyone
my name is matthew williams and i am a champion
I&#39;ve won medals in three different sports and at the Canada National Games. I&#39;ve played basketball at an international level and I&#39;m very proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I work with top coaches and counselors five days a week on basketball and speed skating to stay in top form.
By the way, these are all because of the Special Olympics
Has this changed your view of me and my achievements?
The world doesn&#39;t treat everyone like me as a champion
Not so long ago, people like me were frowned upon
Since the Special Olympics in 1968, this phenomenon has been greatly improved, but in reality it is still often seen that people with intellectual disabilities are often turned a blind eye compared to ordinary people.
People call me &quot;stupid&quot; in front of me, thinking that I don&#39;t care
They call me &quot;idiot&quot; and calling me slow is a completely derogatory usage.
They had no idea how much it hurt me and my friends.
I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m here just to get pity.
I&#39;m here because this problem still exists: There are still problems with the way many people view people with intellectual disabilities or, many more people simply don&#39;t acknowledge their existence.
You all know that the World Games are held this year, right?
I&#39;m one of 6,500 mentally challenged athletes from 165 countries competing in Los Angeles
More than 62,000 people watched the opening ceremony, which was broadcast live on TSN and ESPN
But do you know this?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
I&#39;m here today just to make the bold statement that we should be treated as equals
Special Olympics changes the self-perception of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of audiences
If you&#39;re not familiar with Special Olympics, let me explain. It&#39;s for people with intellectual disabilities.
It is separate from the Paralympics and the Olympics
We have high-quality, year-round sports programs for athletes with intellectual disabilities that can change our lives and our perceptions.
The Special Olympics has changed my life and the lives of many people. It has also changed the way the world views people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability
I played hockey until I was 12 years old
The older I get, the more difficult it becomes to keep up with others. I feel angry and frustrated.
For a while, I didn’t play any sports and didn’t have many friends. I felt abandoned and ignored.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were isolated from society and not made public.
No one feels they can participate in sports let alone become a valuable member of society
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of normal exercise on the health of children with intellectual disabilities.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers have concluded through rigorous scientific research that the reason for the decline in health of children with intellectual disabilities is simply a lack of opportunities for exercise.
Many people question whether people with intellectual disabilities can benefit from sports or athletic competition.
But it&#39;s because of Dr. Hayden, and Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Sharif, who insist on the benefits of exercise and who have proven it more than 4.5 million times by Special Olympics athletes.
Before I joined Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, had no confidence, and didn’t have many friends.
But when I got there, I found that everyone was friendly and helpful. They didn’t discriminate against me and let me be myself.
Now, I&#39;m a basketball player and a speed skater competing at the provincial and national levels and this year I competed in the Summer Special Olympics in Los Angeles where I represented the first Canadian basketball team. world competition
I&#39;m one of the 4.5 million athletes in the world and I&#39;ve heard many similar stories.
Becoming a Special Olympics athlete helps us regain our confidence and dignity
The games also highlight important health needs
Research shows that men with intellectual disabilities live, on average, 13 years less than men without intellectual disabilities, and women with intellectual disabilities live 20 years less than women without intellectual disabilities.
Special Olympics keeps us healthy and actively participates in sports
Our coaches also teach us about nutrition and health
Special Olympics also provides free health screenings to athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctors or receiving health care attention.
Members of my Canadian team joined me against the Nigerian basketball team at the 2015 Summer Special Olympics
The day before the game, members of the Nigerian basketball team participated in the health system physical examination of the sports meeting. 7 of the 10 players received free hearing aids and could hear more clearly for the first time in their lives.
The changes brought to them are amazing
They are more excited, happy and confident because their coach can finally communicate with them in words
They are very excited because they can hear the sound of the basketball, the sound of the whistle and the cheers of the fans standing nearby, sounds that we take for granted.
Special Olympics doesn’t just change athletes’ sports
It also changes athletes&#39; lives
This year, research shows that nearly half of adults in the United States know no one with an intellectual disability. 44% of Americans who have no contact with someone with an intellectual disability are significantly less tolerant and have less positive attitudes.
Then the word with the word &quot;stupid&quot; proves that people with intellectual disabilities are still turned a blind eye and feel isolated from the world.
People use this word either casually or as a curse.
was used on Twitter more than 9 million times last year, which deeply hurts me and the 4.5 million fellow athletes around the world.
People don&#39;t think it&#39;s a curse word but it is.
My fellow athlete and global messenger Franklin Stephens wrote to a political commentator who once used the word &quot;silly&quot; as a slur: &quot;Come to the Special Olympics one day.
See if you still feel the same way when you leave. &quot;
This year, people lined up for hours to watch the final night of the weightlifting competition at the 2015 Special Olympics Summer Games.
People stood up when my teammate Jackie Barrett came on the court. He was known as the Newfoundland Moose. He deadlifted 665 pounds and squatted 611 pounds, setting multiple new records for Special Olympics.
Jackie is the Newfoundland record holder among weightlifters not just in the Special Olympics, but in all weightlifting.
Jackie is now a big star in Los Angeles. ESPN also tweeted about him breaking the weightlifting record in real time and was shocked by his performance.
50 years ago, few could have imagined that someone with intellectual disabilities could do this.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony and cheer for athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We are congratulated and cheered instead of hidden away
Special Olympics teaches athletes to be more confident and proud of themselves
Special Olympics also teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion.
Now, in my sports career, I have dreams and achievements, good training, respect, and a healthier life. And I am also working hard to move forward in my career as a personal trainer.
I am no longer being hidden or bullied. I am here at TED doing a TED Talk
With Special Olympics, the world is a different place but there is still a long way to go
So next time you see someone with intellectual disabilities I hope you see their potential
Next time someone uses the word &quot;stupid&quot; around you, I want you to tell them how hurtful that word is.
I hope you&#39;ll want to see a Special Olympics
Let me share with you one last thought
Nelson Mandela said “Sport has the power to change the world.”
Special Olympics is changing the world. Changing four and a half million athletes, giving us a place and making us confident. Meet friends and experience being a champion without being discriminated against.
thank you all!
You may have never heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone, or Arua, Nigeria.
But I think they are two of the best places in the world.
At the hospital there, a community of nurses, surgeons and scientists has been quietly fighting one of humanity&#39;s deadliest threats - the Lassa virus - for years.
Lassa virus is very similar to Ebola virus.
It can cause severe fever and is often fatal.
But these are the people who risk their lives every day to protect every member of their community and, at the same time, all of us.
The best thing I learned from them is that when I first visited them many years ago, during those challenging days of fighting on the front lines, this is how they started every morning - singing.
They gather together to show off their pleasure.
They show a spirit.
Years passed, and when we would visit each other year after year, I would get together with them and sing, and we would record it, and we loved doing it, because it reminded us that we are more than just We need to explore scientific truth together, and there is a bond of humanity that closely connects us.
And as you can imagine, when things change around you, this connection becomes extremely important, even indispensable.
In March 2014, a huge change occurred. Ebola outbreak breaks out in Guinea.
This is the first outbreak in West Africa, occurring on the border of Sierra Leone and Libya.
The situation was horrific and every one of us was in shock.
In fact, we even suspected that the Lhasa and Ebola epidemics were more widespread than we thought, and we worried that one day it would spread to Kenema.
So my team immediately went out there and joined Dr. Humar Khan and his team, and we set up diagnostic equipment to do some sensitive molecular testing, and when Ebola crossed the border to Sierra Leone, we It can be detected.
We had already set up equipment of this scale for the Lassa virus, we knew how to deal with it, and the team was incredible.
We just need to give them the equipment and space to study Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital&#39;s delivery room, and our team performed those critical molecular tests and confirmed Sierra Leone&#39;s first Ebola case.
This is actually quite remarkable.
They can diagnose the disease immediately, treat patients safely, and begin contact tracing to follow the spread of the disease.
It could have prevented something.
But when that day came, the outbreak had been brewing for months.
With hundreds of cases discovered, it dwarfed all previous outbreaks.
And the virus did not enter Sierra Leone from that single case. It was a huge shock wave.
We have to work closely with the international community, the Ministry of Health, and the local community in Kenema to respond to these cases. The next week, 31 patients came, then 92, then 147 — all coming to Kenema, because it was one of the few places in Sierra Leone that could handle the epidemic.
We worked day and night, trying our best, hoping to help every patient, hoping to get everyone&#39;s attention, but we also did another simple thing.
To detect Ebola, we took samples from patients&#39; blood, and of course we could just throw them away.
But actually, the other thing we can do is add chemicals to the sample to inactivate it, seal it in a box, and ship it across the ocean. And that&#39;s exactly what we do.
We sent the samples to Boston, where my team works,
We also worked in shifts day and night, so we quickly sorted out 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This is a blueprint -- the genome of a virus is a blueprint.
We humans have it too.
It details everything that makes up our bodies and tells us so much.
The results of these efforts are simple yet powerful.
We can take these 99 different virus mutations, observe and compare them, and we can clearly see that compared to the three genomes released by Guinea, we can find that the disease began to spread in Guinea several months ago. , once it breaks into the crowd, it will be quickly transmitted through person-to-person contact.
This information is actually crucial, especially when you&#39;re trying to figure out how to stop the spread of the virus. But the most important thing is contact tracing.
We can also see that as the virus spreads from person to person, it is constantly mutating.
Every mutation is extremely important because all the diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments we use are basically based on that specific genome sequence, which is the root cause of the spread of the epidemic.
Therefore, health experts around the world must respond quickly, improve research methods, and adjust everything they do.
But judging from the position I was in at that time, the method of scientific research is that after I get the data, I may have to stay in the laboratory for several months to study, analyze the data carefully and carefully, write a paper and submit it, and then iterate. Modify, and finally the paper is made public, and then the data can be made public.
This was the current state of scientific research at that time.
Well, that approach certainly didn’t work at that particular time, right?
Some of our friends are working on the front lines of fighting the disease. Obviously, what we need most is external help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did, as soon as the genetic sequencing results came out of the machine, we published the data online.
We open it up to the world and say, &quot;Help us!&quot;
Then help came one after another.
Before we knew it, a large number of people from all over the world contacted us, and they were surprised to see that the data was published online.
Some of the best virus trackers in the world were suddenly part of our team!
We work together in this virtual way. We share information, call each other frequently, and keep in touch. We hope to track the spread of the virus every second and find ways to contain it.
In fact, there are many ways for us to form such a group.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic breaks out around the world, is constantly getting information, participating and investing.
Everyone wants to contribute something.
It&#39;s amazing the power of all the people in the world, and the Internet connecting us.
Can you imagine? We are no longer afraid to talk to others, and all of us are saying, “Let’s get to work.
Let&#39;s work together, we can do it! &quot;
But the problem is that the data that all of us use, the data that we search on Google, is far from meeting the needs of our work.
When this happens, we miss a lot of opportunities.
So at the beginning of the outbreak in Kenema, we had 106 clinical records of patients, and again, we made those available to the public.
In our own laboratory, if you give us those 106 records, we can ask the computer to predict the next Ebola patient, and the accuracy is close to 100%.
We also made an application to publish these predictions so that workers in the health field around the world can obtain this information.
But 106 reports are not enough to make this approach effective.
So we&#39;re waiting for more clinical reports before we can release that software,
And those reports never came.
We&#39;re still waiting, we&#39;re still fixing the software, we&#39;re sitting in the lab instead of collaborating with everyone.
This is really... we cannot accept it at all.
Right? You, all of you, cannot accept this.
Now is the time when life hangs on a thread.
But the fact is, a lot of people have died, a lot of people working in the medical field, including my beloved colleagues, five of them: Mbaru Fonny, Alex Mubi, Dr. Humal Khan. , Alice Kwoma, and Muhammad Fuller.
These are just five of the thousands of health care workers who have died in Kenema and elsewhere while the world waits and we keep our heads down, working independently and without communication. of.
Ebola, like every other threat to humanity, is fueled by mistrust, fragmentation and isolation between people.
When we build barriers and fight against each other, the virus becomes even more arrogant.
But Ebola is unlike other threats, because this time, we are a family.
We are all on the same page.
If one person gets Ebola, we might be next.
So we live in this world, with common weaknesses, common strengths, common fears, common hopes, and I sincerely hope that we can work together with joy.
One of my graduate students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the word &quot;Kenema,&quot; the name of the city and the hospital where we were working in Sierra Leone, means &quot;Kenema&quot; in the local Mende language. As transparent and clear as a river, and accessible to all eyes.”
This has a very profound meaning for us, and we didn&#39;t realize it, but we always felt that in order to honor Kenema, all the people in the place where we fought, we had to be open and collaborative, we had to share information, we had to work together. Make progress together.
We must do this.
Everyone should ask this of themselves and others - when disaster strikes, we should all open our hearts to each other and fight this battle together.
Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, and it will not be the last. There are many other microorganisms lurking around us in the world, such as Lassa virus and other organisms.
The next time a disaster occurs, it may be in a city with a population of one million, and it may break out there.
The virus may spread through the air.
The virus may even be spread intentionally.
I know it&#39;s scary, and I understand that, but I also know that this experience has taught us that we have enough technology and capabilities to win this battle, not just this battle, but all viruses. The road is one foot high.
But we can only do that if we work together, and we do it with joy.
So for Dr. Khan, and all the people who have sacrificed their lives on the front lines of fighting the disease, who will always fight alongside us, let us always fight with them.
Our world should not be defined by the destruction caused by a virus. We must let the light of unity and cooperation of billions of hearts spread across the earth.
thank you all.
