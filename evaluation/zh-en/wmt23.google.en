4.1 Overview
The characters included in this document are encoded in single-byte, double-byte or four-byte encodings.
The single-byte part includes all 128 characters from 0x00 to 0x7F of GB/T 11383-1989.
4.3 Double-byte part
The double-byte part includes all graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, CJK unified Chinese characters in GB/T 13000, and some graphic characters.
The characters in the double-byte part are in accordance with the provisions in Appendix A.
The graphics, code positions and functions of ideographic descriptors shall comply with the provisions of Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 is a unified code for Chinese characters used in China, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam and other countries and regions.
Chinese characters with unique abstract glyphs are assigned separate code positions; Chinese characters with different sources but the same abstract glyphs are assigned shared code positions.
The encoded Chinese characters are called CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea.
4.4 Four-byte part
The four-byte part includes the 66 CJK unified Chinese characters in GB/T 13000 (9FA6-9FEF, excluding the 8 characters 9FB4~9FBB) in addition to the above-mentioned double-byte characters, CJK unified Chinese character extension A, CJK unified Chinese character extension BC, CJK unified Chinese character extension C, CJK unified Chinese character extension DC, CJK unified Chinese character extension D, CJK unified Chinese character extension F and the characters of minority languages that have been encoded in GB/T 13000.
The characters in the four-byte part are as specified in Appendix C.
5 Overall structure
In the text, numbers preceded by 0x are in hexadecimal, and numbers not preceded by 0x are in decimal.
All codes in the appendix are expressed in hexadecimal, and other numbers are expressed in decimal.
The single-byte part adopts the encoding structure of GB/T 11383-1989, using code points 0x00~0x7F.
The double-word part uses two 8-bit binary bit strings to represent a character, with the first byte code position from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the last byte code positions are 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE respectively.
The four-byte part uses 0x30-0x39 which is not used in GB/T 11383-1989 as the suffix to expand the double-byte encoding. The encoding range is 0x81308130-0xFE39FE39.
The encoding range of the first byte of a four-byte character is 0x81 to 0xFE; the encoding range of the second byte is 0x30 to 0x39; the encoding range of the third byte is 0x81 to 0xFE; the encoding range of the fourth byte is 0x30 to 0x39. That is: 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; Oo2douolag0c “0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30 to 0xFE39FE39.

This manual page is an extract from the complete documentation for the GNU C compiler and is limited to explaining the meaning of the options.
Unless someone volunteers to maintain them, EURo files and Info files are authoritative documents.
If you find a discrepancy between the manual page and the software, check the Info
If we find that the contents of this manual page are out of date and cause significant confusion and complaints, we will stop publishing it. There is no alternative, such as updating the Info files at the same time as the man pages, because other work on maintaining Gnu cc does not leave us time to do this. The GNU Project considers man pages to be outdated artifacts that should be used elsewhere.
For complete and up-to-date documentation, see the Info file `gee&#39; or the Using and Porting GNU CC (for version 2.0) (ft&amp;/HAIZE#H GNU CC 2.0) manual. Both are derived from the Texinfo source file gee.texinfo.
DESCRIPTION The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The source file suffix identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix controls the default settings:
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c file, and sets the c-style link.
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C++ file and sets the linker to C++.
The source file&#39;s suffix indicates the language and subsequent operations:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
. CXX C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i preprocessed c file; compile, assemble
.ii preprocessed c++ file; compile, assemble
.s assembly language source program; assembly
Assembly language source program; preprocessing, assembly
.h preprocessor file; usually not on the command line. Other files with the same suffix are passed to the linker. Usually include:
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E option is used (or compilation errors prevent the complete process), linking is always the last step.
During the linking phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognized file names (including specified .o H standard files and .a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order given in the command line.
Options must be given separately: de &#39; is completely different from `-d -r &#39;.
Most `-=E: and `-W&#39; options have two opposite forms: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only formats that are not the default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly specifies the language of the following input file as language (instead of the default choice taken from the end of the file name).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x&#39; option is encountered. The optional language
Disables any explicit language specification, so that subsequent files are processed according to the filename suffix RE AS E ` -x &#39; option).
If you want to run only some of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking), you can use the `-x&#39; option (or the name of the file) to tell geo where to start, and the `~-c&#39;, `-s&#39;, or `-E&#39; options to tell geo where to end. Note that some option combinations (e.g., `-x cpp-output -E&#39;) {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC prefixes source file names with `.o&#39; followed by `.ec&#39;. You can choose a different name with the -o option. GCC ignores any unrecognized input following the -ec option.
The target file.
Stop after compiling, without assembling the file.
Use pipes instead of temporary files between different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from pipes. The GNU assembler does not have this problem. C &quot;dialects&quot; that the assembler can accept: Supports C programs that conform to the ANSI standard.
This turns off certain GNU Cc feature keywords that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, as well as popular and rarely used ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, and the use of the above functions.
Function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo();&#39;, are treated in C style -- that is, without specifying the number or types of parameters. (C++ only)
Normally, such a function foo in C++ means that the parameter is null.
The section listings here have been truncated to try to support some aspects of legacy C compilers.
See the NU c manual for details, we have removed the details so that people will not HERI when the content is out of date.
Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the `-traditional&#39; option has the added effect of allowing assignments to this.
This has the same effect as the `-Ethis-is-variable&#39; option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
In particular, this applies to the preprocessor as mentioned above, but does not include the other effects of the `-traditional&#39; option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers Enable the use of `$&#39; characters in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers&#39; option to explicitly disable the use of the `$&#39; character.
(GNU C++ allows `$&#39; by default on some target systems, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv Enable implicit conversion of ant types to enumeration types (MEF c++).
Normally GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.
-fexternal--templates Generate smaller code for template declarations (C++ only) by generating only one copy of each template function where it is defined.
To use this option successfully, you must mark all files that use the template with `#pragma implementatio&#39; (definition) or `#Pragma interface&#39; (declaration).
When a program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates &#39;, template instantiations are all external types. You must make the required instantiations appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved with a typedef, which references each instance as needed.
In contrast, when compiled with the default option ` -fno-exteznal-templates &#39;, all template instantiations are explicitly made built-in.
All member functions (except constructors and the mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of their class.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal vtable.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in these cases, the call is made directly.
-fcond-mismatch Allow the second and third arguments of conditional expressions to have types that do not match.
The value of such an expression is Void. -fthis--is-variable allows assignment to this (C++ only).
Incorporating user-defined free storage management into C++ makes assignable `this&#39; obsolete.
Therefore, by default, assigning a value to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can enable this behavior with the `-fthis-is-variable&#39; option.
-funsigned-char Define char as an unsigned type, just like unsigned char.
Each machine has its own default char type. It can be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned char when relying on the signedness of the data.
But many programs have been written to use only plain char, and expect it to be signed (or unsigned, depending on the machine the program is written for).
This option, and its inverse, make such programs work with the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be explicitly declared as either signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one or the other.
If no `signed&#39; or `unsigned&#39; modifier is explicitly stated, these options are used to define signed or unsigned bitfields.
By default, bit fields are signed, since the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed. However, if the `-traditional&#39; option is specified, bit fields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings Store string constants in the writable data segment and treat them no differently.
This is for compatibility with old programs that thought changing string constants was a very bad idea. The `-traditional&#39; option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The impact of COVID-19 on the drug market
The impact could be similar to the 2008 economic crisis
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
The disease has overwhelmed health services in many countries, and restrictions imposed by governments have caused severe disruptions in the global economy.
The impact of the epidemic on drug markets is unclear and difficult to predict, but it is likely to be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to make drugs as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and basic chemicals.
Traffickers, unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions, may have to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and supply may change and the ability of governments to respond may be hampered.
The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but there are still some lessons to be learned from previous crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began looking for cheaper synthetic substances and usage patterns shifted to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments cut drug-related budgets.
If governments respond to the current recession in the same way, interventions to prevent drug use and related risk behaviours, and drug treatment services, are likely to be hit hard.
Furthermore, interdiction operations and international cooperation may be given lower priority, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
The direct impact on drug trafficking in countries where large quantities of drugs are smuggled on commercial flights is expected to be greatest.
Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or concealed in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. With restrictions on air passenger transport imposed almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs could be completely disrupted.
While international postal supply chains have also been disrupted, trafficking using the dark web and cargo mailings is likely to increase.
In the long term, economic recession and related lockdown measures could disrupt drug markets.
Due to rising unemployment and lack of opportunity, poor and vulnerable populations will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug use disorders and turn to illegal drug-related activities - whether production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation, offering their services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to expand their ranks.
As governments’ capacity to respond decreases, these shifts are likely to take root quickly and become the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
Population growth patterns partially explain market expansion
Drug abuse has been increasing around the world, both in terms of overall figures and as a percentage of the world&#39;s population.
In 2009, there were an estimated 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018, there were an estimated 269 million drug users, accounting for 5.3% of this population.
Over the past two decades, drug abuse has increased much faster in developing countries than in developed countries.
This partly reflects differences in overall population growth over the period, 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also reflects faster growth in the younger population in developing countries.
Teenagers and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group grew by 16% in developing countries, while it fell by 10% in developed countries.
1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets
In both developed and developing countries, drug abuse is more common in urban areas than in rural areas.
The overall increase in drug abuse is partly due to the massive migration of people from rural to urban areas - more than half of the world&#39;s population now lives in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, particularly in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.
Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but it is the poorest people who bear the greatest burden of disease. Worldwide, drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are particularly strongly associated with wealthier parts of the world.
Likewise, within countries, the prevalence of drug abuse is higher among wealthier segments of society.
But the rate of transition to drug use disorders is higher among people of lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a few countries suggest a link between harmful drug use patterns and health conditions and low income.
These patterns appear to be less common in wealthier social classes.
Economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate risks for the most vulnerable groups, including people who use drugs.
For example, changes in labor markets, such as rising unemployment, have been associated with increases in drug use in the past, and the pandemic has forced tens of millions of people out of work worldwide.
COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of the drug market The COVID-19 pandemic may cause more farmers to increase or engage in illegal crop cultivation, either because the control capacity of national authorities is reduced or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illegal activities due to the economic crisis.
Trafficking at sea may have increased as a result of reduced air and land traffic as a result of COVID-19-related restrictions, as the risk of interception at sea is low and there are more smuggled people than by air or land.
There have been recent reports of cocaine shipments being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of substances not under international control is stable, but new and potentially harmful opioids are increasing and drug markets are becoming increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs has also increased rapidly.
Around 500 new active substances enter the domestic markets of the Member States every year.
Currently, most of these are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.
While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
In 2014, opioid-type new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2% of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.
Many of the opioid new psychoactive substances are analogs of fentanyl, which have demonstrated efficacy and harm and have caused overdose deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used as an adulterator in heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, and in the manufacture of counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
There is some evidence that NPS doping is also taking place in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with NPS that produce stimulant effects.
2. Use of new psychoactive substances may become entrenched among vulnerable groups
There has almost never been a large market for a single type of NPS.
But evidence from Europe suggests synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported on the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with the majority identifying synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals forces drug manufacturers to innovate Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors in the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and &quot;ecstasy&quot; are already under international control.
Drug traffickers and manufacturers are constantly searching for substitutes—not only less-regulated substances but also chemicals designed specifically to circumvent regulations, so-called “designer precursors.”
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug makers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this is already happening: in March 2020, reported shortages of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia prompted an increase in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly
Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate markets in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appear to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The amount of opiates seized by Russian federal authorities fell by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use dropped significantly.
But the market for stimulants seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and a-pyrrolidinophenvalerophenone, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities have reported a recent sharp rise in the number of clandestine laboratories manufacturing a variety of illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years to 152 laboratories in 2018.
Methamphetamine markets grow in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, alongside Captagon and Tramadol.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users stating that cannabis was more difficult to obtain than Captagon or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities have uncovered several methamphetamine laboratories and the Board has expressed concern about the large importation of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors in methamphetamine laboratories.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture appears to have begun in 2014.
Since then, methamphetamine seizures have been rising steadily.
But seizures in the first half of 2019 totaled 1,657 kilograms - a sharp jump from the previous year.
Large seizures of methamphetamine believed to have originated in Afghanistan have been made in other countries, also suggesting that production in that country is rising rapidly.
Policy changes and changing trends
Most jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical cannabis use have seen an increase in cannabis use
Canada, Uruguay and 11 jurisdictions in the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized the non-medical use of cannabis.
In Colorado and Washington, two of the first states to pass legislation in the United States, non-medical marijuana use among adults has increased, particularly in the past month and daily or almost daily, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that cannabis use has increased in Uruguay since 2011, with use almost doubling in the last month.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is regular and frequent cannabis use.
Short-term data from Canada also suggest that use increased as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019.
However, 40% of cannabis users in 2019 still obtained some products from illegal sources.
Is legalization behind the plunge in global cannabis herb seizures?
Global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years in 2018, driven by a drop in seizures in North America, which have fallen 84 per cent over the past decade.
In contrast, seizures in the rest of the world almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect The effectiveness of regulation of new psychoactive substances in China remains difficult to assess.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for NPS show different prevalence rates of NPS use.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased following the adoption of domestic legislation.
Vulnerable groups face harms from legal and illegal drug markets Medicinal opioids for pain management and palliative care are available mainly in high-income countries Pain medications are unevenly distributed across regions.
In 2018, more than 90% of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for approximately 12% of the world&#39;s population.
Low- and middle-income countries are estimated to be home to 88% of the world’s population but consume less than 10% of pharmaceutical opioids.
Barriers to accessing pharmaceutical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing a drug use disorder. In 2018, an estimated 35.6 million people had a drug use disorder.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization can increase the risk of substance use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. This is supported by studies in high-income countries, where an individual’s adverse socioeconomic trajectory—not just their situation at a single point in time—is associated with risk of substance use disorders.
Drug use disorders can also reinforce socioeconomic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thus contributing to a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes can also be linked to stigmatizing attitudes and outcomes within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexually diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or face problems accessing treatment services.
The broader societal impact of harmful drug use has increased over the past decade, as measured by the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) metric, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death.
Between 2007 and 2018, the number of global disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17%.
The increase in DALYs associated with liver cancer, caused by untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, was particularly high — 40 percent.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to identify all causal relationships between psychoactive substance use and violence.
Limited data from around the world suggest that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicides.
But alcohol appears to play a bigger role than drugs in violent incidents.
While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this association can be partially attributed to a variety of mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The links between drug trafficking and violence are multifaceted.
Large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out without violence if stable criminal structures already exist.
In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depend less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of illegal markets, the death or imprisonment of high-profile criminals, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
Latest Trends
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, opioids are the most harmful
An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.
By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the hazards associated with opioids have been overlooked due to the small number of users.
Such substances were responsible for 66 per cent of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, and 50 per cent of the 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death believed to be attributable to drug use.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, it’s tramadol that’s fueling the opioid crisis; in North America, it’s fentanyl. The two regions share little in common in terms of their economies, demographics or general patterns of drug use, but both are struggling to combat an opioid crisis fueled by substances that are easily available and cheap to produce.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a 20-year increase in opioid overdose deaths.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results, albeit at a lower level.
Fentanyl overdose deaths are partly due to the unpredictable effects of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.
The market for non-medical tramadol has grown significantly in West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa.
In the region, an increasing number of patients with tramadol use disorders are receiving treatment.
In 2017, the amount of tramadol seized globally increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating tramadol, global seizures fell to 32 tons.
Contributing to the crises in both places is the simplicity of manufacturing and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogs or their precursors.
Exacerbating the crises in both places is the availability of these substances on both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making their detection and prevention more difficult.
Stimulant use is increasing
The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are seeing increasing use in their major markets.
An estimated 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as the drug is popular in North America and Western Europe.
In the same year, approximately 27 million people used amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine-type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to most available indicators, methamphetamine use has been increasing in both regions over the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes as substitutes for each other so that use of one drug increases while use of the other decreases, and sometimes both increasing and decreasing simultaneously to meet demand in the same market.
COVID-19 puts injecting drug users at increased risk
It is estimated that in 2018, there were approximately 11.3 million people who injected drugs, and approximately 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people who inject drugs are infected with HIV and 5.5 million are infected with hepatitis C.
In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died from drug abuse, half of whom died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, while hepatitis C among injecting drug users remains mostly untreated.
5 Opioid shortages caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injecting or inject more frequently, more harmful patterns of use may emerge.

EU summit debates refugee policy, EU officials: reception process full of bottlenecks - China News Service
EU summit argues over refugee policy, EU officials: bottlenecks exist at every step of the reception process
[Global Times special correspondent in Belgium Niu Ruifei] According to a report by AFP on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration to make it easier to expel illegal immigrants.
The EU&#39;s move is reportedly a response to Europe&#39;s growing concern about illegal immigration, with the core problem for the EU today being that very few illegal immigrants are ultimately deported.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to &quot;immediately mobilise substantial EU funds&quot; to strengthen external borders, including with infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and member states are arguing over issues such as payment for the fence.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs.
But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU could share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along its external borders, it would free up national budgets and speed up construction.
According to the European Euractiv website, EU officials admitted that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process. Limited reception capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states cannot prevent refugees from submitting &quot;countless&quot; asylum applications in EU countries. The EU&#39;s refugee reception system is in a near &quot;permanent crisis.&quot;
According to the European Commission, the EU&#39;s Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half from the previous year.
Meanwhile, the European Union recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
Against this backdrop, the summit also reached an agreement on a “principle” that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants based on a court ruling in another member state.
In addition, the report said that EU leaders also agreed to &quot;increase the use of the concept of safe countries&quot;, which will pave the way for the EU to develop a common list.

The United States escalates the &quot;chip war&quot; and hits the global semiconductor industry hard - China News Network
Recently, the U.S. &quot;chip war&quot; against China has shown signs of escalating - first, under pressure from the United States, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; later, foreign media reported that the U.S. government was considering cutting off all ties between U.S. suppliers and Huawei and prohibiting U.S. suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order to restrict U.S. investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries... Shortly after the beginning of 2023, the United States has been using vicious tricks to curb the development of China&#39;s semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped its efforts to crack down on China&#39;s &quot;chip&quot; development. On the one hand, it has precisely suppressed China&#39;s semiconductor production and supply chain, while on the other hand, it has built a &quot;de-Sinicized&quot; semiconductor industry chain alliance, attempting to completely &quot;leave&quot; China behind in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is wooing South Korea to establish a &quot;technological alliance&quot;, or establishing a chip &quot;Quad&quot; with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, China, or using the &quot;Quadrilateral Security Dialogue&quot; and &quot;Indo-Pacific Economic Framework&quot; mechanisms to establish a &quot;small circle&quot; of the semiconductor industry chain, the United States is introducing politicized, factionalized and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, attempting to build a closed production and supply chain cycle dominated by the United States, thereby making up for its shortcomings in the chip manufacturing field and maintaining its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the United States&#39; high-profile &quot;chip strategy&quot; against China is also &quot;hurting the enemy a thousand and hurting itself eight hundred.&quot;
Recently, Lam Research, a well-known American chip manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that due to the latest round of chip manufacturing equipment export ban to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
ASML Holding, a global lithography machine giant in the Netherlands, recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.
US media analyzed that after the US government implemented brutal suppression on China&#39;s chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies were severely affected, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.
The so-called suppression of China&#39;s advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has actually dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has long formed a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain.
According to professional estimates, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross borders of various countries more than 70 times and the entire process takes up to 100 days.
Although the U.S. semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially advanced process technology, and is heavily dependent on East Asia.
Even if the United States tries its best to guide the production and supply chain of advanced chips to shift to a &quot;small circle&quot; regional development dominated by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of global semiconductor-related industries will be difficult to change.
The United States’ forceful “reshaping” and “de-Sinicization” of the semiconductor industry chain has dealt a heavy blow to the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the world&#39;s future industries, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, including the Innovation and Competition Act, the American Competitiveness Act of 2022, and the Chips and Science Act, using its technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership; it has used both rewards and punishments on its allies, luring and forcing chip manufacturers such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to set up factories in the United States, and striving to ensure the United States&#39; global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created trouble for the development of China&#39;s chip industry and related industries, and reaped real benefits.
But in the long run, the United States&#39; hysterical suppression will force China&#39;s chip industry to make continuous breakthroughs and cause it to lose the huge Chinese market. This will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of American technology companies and damage the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension financial products are on sale and can be held for as short as 360 days - China News Service
The first batch of personal pension financial products went on sale
7 products from institutions can be selected, and the shortest holding period is only 360 days
The personal pension financial product is finally launched.
On February 10, China Financial Management Network released the first list of personal pension wealth management products, and seven personal pension wealth management products from ICBC Wealth Management, ABC Wealth Management and China Post Wealth Management were officially launched.
At this point, the &quot;shelf&quot; of personal pension accounts finally has four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds.
According to reports, the first batch of personal pension wealth management products are all public net value open-end products, including 5 newly issued products and 2 existing products. Except for one product which is a mixed product, the other 6 products are all fixed income products.
Beijing Youth Daily reporters saw that four of the five newly launched products were from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which were fixed-income products. The shortest holding periods were 365 days, 540 days, 720 days and 1,080 days, respectively. The corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) were 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, and 5.25% - 5.75%, respectively.
The remaining new product is &quot;Youyin Wealth Tianyi Hongjin Shortest Holding 1095 Days No. 1&quot;, which is also a fixed income product. It started fundraising on February 10 and ended on February 19. The risk level is level two.
Of the two existing products, one is the ABC Wealth Management &quot;ABC Tongxin Lingdong&quot; 360-day technological innovation RMB wealth management product, which is a mixed investment product with a risk level of three.
Another existing product is &quot;Youyin Wealth Tianyi Hongjin Shortest Holding 365 Days No. 1&quot;, a fixed income type. It started fundraising on December 30 last year, officially started operation on January 4 this year, and the cumulative net value on February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the &quot;Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pension Funds&quot;, the financial products that personal pension account funds can invest in include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, public funds, etc.
The launch of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marks that personal pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through their personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the &quot;Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies&quot;.
The Measures stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension products such as personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension public fund products through their personal pension accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice to clarify that the individual pension system will be launched and implemented in 36 pilot cities and regions including Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Xiongan New Area in Hebei Province, and Jincheng City in Shanxi Province.
As of the end of 2022, the number of people participating in individual pension plans was 19.54 million, the number of payers was 6.13 million, and the total payment amount was 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, banks participating in the pilot program only listed three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension public funds.
Now that personal pension financial products are available, how should investors choose?
Experts from the R&amp;D department of Bank of Communications&#39; wealth management products said that compared with other personal pension products, pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products in the pilot phase have three characteristics.
First, stability. The risk management mechanism is more sound, the investment strategies and concepts are more stable, and independent custody by a third party other than the parent bank is implemented.
Second, long-term nature. During the pilot phase, the term of pension wealth management products is 5 years or more. For the personal pension wealth management products to be issued in the next step, the minimum holding period is 1 year in principle, and holding for more than 3 years is encouraged.
Third, it is affordable. The threshold for purchasing products is low, and the starting purchase point is generally 1 yuan, and some are as low as 0.01 yuan. The rates of product custody fees, management fees, etc. are more favorable.
Professionals point out that investors should make choices based on product features and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of longer term, higher interest rate and high security, and are suitable for people with weak risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection, and are more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks but can accept stable returns; personal pension wealth management products and public fund products do not guarantee principal or returns, and have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are higher, and are suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and higher risk tolerance.

The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust - China News Network
Another large gym goes bankrupt?
Recently, the issue of rights protection of members of Zhongjian Fitness, a well-known fitness institution, has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that the store they were in was not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the institution’s bankruptcy caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of the public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the organization came forward to respond and promised to work hard to protect the legal rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm was calmed down.
Some stores of some fitness institutions have encountered operational problems and have been temporarily closed. Consumers could have remained calm and waited for the problems to be resolved. Why are many members&#39; first reaction &quot;something bad is happening&quot;?
Behind the fitness club members’ rights protection storm is the deep-seated problem of the industry’s trust crisis.
Traditional gyms in China generally adopt a prepaid payment model, and “making money without users coming” is the underlying logic of their development.
Obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and continuously opening new stores seems to be a repeatable cycle, but in reality it is living beyond one&#39;s means and cannot form a stable profit model.
Negative information in the industry, such as gyms running away, has frequently been reported, causing a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the perspective of market prospects, gyms are certainly a good business with &quot;money prospects&quot;.
Although the fitness industry has experienced ups and downs, it has always attracted attention from capital.
Multiple data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption and other fields is constantly rising, and the market continues to recover.
Specifically in the fitness market, as residents&#39; living standards steadily improve and the concept of healthy living becomes deeply rooted in people&#39;s hearts, the fitness industry has great potential for development.
The better the situation becomes, the more the industry needs to pay attention to development quality.
However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumption recovery. Just after emerging from the crisis, they sound the clarion call for expansion and invest all the financing funds into building new stores.
It is undeniable that due to the impact of the epidemic in recent years, many institutions have withdrawn and the industry has been reshuffled. It may be a new opportunity for capable companies to selectively increase their acquisition efforts and re-position their positions at this time.
However, if the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on a long-term and steady path, the industry must change its traditional model and business strategy.
Only by taking steady steps and rebuilding consumers&#39; trust and sense of security can we truly win the market and the future.
Compared with building new stores to seize market share, what the fitness industry needs now is to calm down and optimize services and use high-quality development to retain users.
First of all, we need to retain users through service.
Gyms belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to the &quot;user orientation&quot;, focus closely on user needs, and focus their operations on improving service quality.
Secondly, we must rely on digital transformation to improve user experience.
For example, the currently popular Internet gym model allows users to pay per visit and choose the venue themselves.
At the same time, physical data and sports data can be effectively utilized to meet social needs and achieve a complete service closed loop from online to offline.
Without personal training sales pitches and huge annual membership fees, users’ concerns about fitness organizations “running away” are reduced, and their sense of trust is enhanced.
In addition, we must actively explore diversified business formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has shifted from single services to scenario consumption. Fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption. Peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment required for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.

Buy at a higher price and get the difference back!
&quot;Price difference compensation&quot; reappears in Nanjing property market - China News Service
Yangtze Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangtze Evening News/Ziniu News reporter discovered in an interview on the 10th that the &quot;price guarantee agreement&quot; that had not been seen for more than a decade has returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A real estate project located in Jiangbei New District claimed &quot;price difference compensation&quot;. Before the delivery of the house, the discounts on other houses were greater than the previous discounts, and the developer was willing to exchange houses for buyers and refund the price difference.
There are many conditions in the &quot;price guarantee agreement&quot;
The property, located in Jiangbei New District, is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. Mr. Sun, a house hunter, told reporters that he found a &quot;statement&quot; when he was visiting the property last weekend.
The picture he sent to the reporter showed that the developer of the real estate project promised that for anyone who purchased a house between February 1 and February 28, from the date both parties signed the sales contract to the delivery of the corresponding house, if the discount on other houses in the project was greater than the discount on the previous purchase (limited to other unsold commercial housing of the same apartment type, same building, same unit, and same property type as the commercial housing), the developer could exchange houses for the buyers and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun said that the property consultant told him that this was actually a &quot;price guarantee agreement&quot; whose purpose was to allow buyers to make their purchase with confidence without having to worry about developers reducing prices for promotions. &quot;Now I&#39;m worried that the price will drop after I buy it. I don&#39;t have time to make a scene at the sales office, but it would be really frustrating if I don&#39;t make a scene.&quot;
There are also many home buyers who believe that although the &quot;price guarantee agreement&quot; is to give home buyers a &quot;peace of mind&quot;, the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a house for basic needs in Jiangbei, said that the guaranteed houses must first be of the same type, in the same building, and in the same unit. There are very few houses that buyers can compare prices with, so the &quot;threshold&quot; is quite high.
Some home buyers also believe that due to information asymmetry, additional concessions may be given during sales, making it difficult for buyers to &quot;protect their rights.&quot;
Whether it can retain home buyers remains to be seen
The reporter inquired on Nanjing Online Real Estate and learned that the real estate project had sold 252 units in two buildings in November last year. The unit areas ranged from 105 square meters, 114 square meters, to 129 square meters, and the average price of fully furnished units was 39,843 yuan per square meter.
However, more than two months later, online real estate showed that the total number of unsold units in the project is 157, accounting for 62.3%. Among them, Building 8 has a total of 128 units, with 113 unsold units, and Building 7 has 44 of the 124 units unsold. The total number of units sold in the project is only 33, accounting for only 13%.
According to market insiders, the &quot;price guarantee agreement&quot; also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate project on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched a &quot;Price Guarantee Plan&quot; to attract home buyers. The specific content was &quot;The company solemnly promises that if the project&#39;s discount is expanded within one year, the company will refund the resulting difference to the old owners.&quot;
Subsequently, in April 2011, nine real estate projects in Nanjing also offered some housing units and promised to &quot;compensate for the price difference.&quot;
&quot;The property market is picking up, and it needs a shot of &#39;heart booster&#39; at this time.
&quot;Mr. Shen, a senior operator in the Nanjing real estate industry, said that the &quot;price guarantee agreement&quot; is also one of the marketing methods of real estate companies.
He believes that developers now need confidence more than home buyers, and the introduction of the &quot;price guarantee agreement&quot; is actually to encourage them.
As for whether home buyers can be retained, he said that this depends on the influence of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, and it remains to be seen at present.
Taiwan&#39;s economy starts the year poorly as multiple data show decline - Chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11 (Reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) The export trade volume has been &quot;black for five consecutive months&quot;, the manufacturing purchasing managers&#39; index (PMI) has tightened for seven consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has returned to the &quot;3-digit&quot; level... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
Experts believe that Taiwan&#39;s economic performance at the beginning of the year was poor and the pressure on growth was considerable.
According to the Taiwan authorities&#39; financial affairs department, Taiwan&#39;s exports in January this year were US$31.51 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 21.2%, marking the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
The export value of 11 major export categories all declined compared with the same period last year.
Plastics, rubber and their products, and optical equipment experienced the largest declines, down 37.6% and 35.7% year-on-year respectively.
Exports of electronic components fell 20.1% year-on-year, the biggest drop in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits fell 18.3% year-on-year, the biggest drop in 14 years.
Cai Meina, director of the department&#39;s statistics department, said this shows that the effect of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry has spread and the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that Taiwan&#39;s imports and exports both fell in January, with the trade surplus amounting to only US$2.34 billion, the lowest level in the past three years.
The Taiwan authorities&#39; financial affairs department believes that the global terminal demand has decreased, and the industry&#39;s inventory adjustment has suppressed manufacturers&#39; willingness to purchase materials. The export slump is unlikely to improve in the short term, and Taiwan&#39;s export decline in the first quarter of this year may be higher than expected.
According to the Taiwan Institute for Economic Research, Taiwan&#39;s manufacturing purchasing managers&#39; index (PMI) was 40.4% in January this year after seasonal adjustment, a further drop of 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and has been tightening for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, PMI uses 50% as the boom-bust line. An index greater than 50% represents economic expansion, and vice versa.
Among the five components of Taiwan&#39;s PMI in January, new orders, production and labor employment tightened, supplier delivery time decreased, and inventory tightened.
All six major industries reported a contraction in the PMI, and the industries were ranked in order of contraction speed as follows: power and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optics industry (35.2%), chemicals and biotechnology and medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation industry (42.6%) and food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the Taiwan authorities&#39; Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics announced that Taiwan&#39;s CPI year-on-year growth rate was 3.04% in January this year, breaking through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared 28.25%, hitting a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special commissioner of Taiwan&#39;s Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, admitted that the increase in vegetable prices was indeed beyond expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year. Inflationary pressure still exists and is still at a high point.
Looking ahead to Taiwan&#39;s economy this year, experts are pessimistic based on reports from local media including the United Daily News and Yahoo Finance.
Wu Daren, professor of economics at Taiwan&#39;s National Central University, analyzed that the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies and increase the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the reduction in orders has led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and family economy, which in turn has impacted consumer spending power.
Chiu Ta-sheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economics, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not been resolved this year and demand continues to shrink. He estimates that Taiwan&#39;s export recession will continue into the first half of the year.
Since Taiwan&#39;s economy is supported by exports, the full-year economic growth performance will be worse than last year due to the sluggish exports.
&quot;An important engine for global recovery&quot; - China News Service
&quot;In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has demonstrated strong resilience.
Recent market expectations show that the international community is generally optimistic about China&#39;s future development.
&quot;Julio Rios, a well-known Spanish expert on China issues and honorary consultant of China Policy Observer, said in an interview with our reporter a few days ago that China&#39;s epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Rios said that faced with various unexpected shocks, China responded calmly with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China is unswervingly expanding its opening up, the endogenous driving force of economic development continues to strengthen, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises develop in a coordinated manner.
Every year, China&#39;s two national sessions are held, and deputies and delegates discuss major national development plans and hot issues concerning people&#39;s livelihood, widely building consensus, rallying people&#39;s hearts and wisdom, and adding strength to China&#39;s development.
“Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term rapid development and has now entered a stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to Chinese wisdom and solutions, and expects China&#39;s development to bring new opportunities to the world.
Rios said that China is currently making every effort to promote scientific and technological innovation and inject new impetus into economic and social development. &quot;Capital investment, talent training, and policy incentives will keep China full of vitality in the new five-year plan.&quot;
In Rios&#39; view, economic system reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has leveraged the strengths of both its market economy and its socialist system to take proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, we will increase financial support for the real economy, support the development of private, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing, adhere to innovative development, promote employment, improve the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meet the people&#39;s multi-level and diversified consumption needs... China will fully, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development concept, focus on promoting high-quality development, and build a new development pattern, which will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
“Economic stabilization and recovery after the epidemic is the common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China&#39;s economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
Rios said that he hopes that the Belt and Road cooperation will continue to play its important role in improving the infrastructure level of various countries and strengthening connectivity in various fields, and continue to release greater momentum.

Save half the cost or more?
Henan Province standardizes and integrates prices of oral implant medical services
CCTV News: Dental implants are an ideal choice for many patients with missing teeth, but the price of tens of thousands of yuan per implant has always been a prohibitive price for many patients.
Since the beginning of this year, with the accelerated implementation of centralized procurement of dental implants, various regions have also put price reduction of dental implants on the agenda.
Starting from February 10, the full-process price control target for a single conventional dental implant medical service in Henan Province is 4,300 yuan, and the full-process cost of a single conventional implant is no more than 97% of the control target.
Dental implants refer to a method of restoring missing teeth that uses a lower structure implanted in bone tissue to support and retain the upper dental restoration.
The reporter learned from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University that, taking a single conventional implant as an example, the price from implantation to final restoration is about 16,000 to 17,000 yuan.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy was introduced, the doctor told me that a case like mine would cost around 8,000 yuan, less than 10,000 yuan, so I can basically save half of that.
On the basis of the current items, Henan Province has also integrated and determined 15 oral implant medical service price items such as &quot;implant insertion fee (single)&quot;, and unified the prices and medical insurance payment categories of provincial public medical institutions, and canceled or adjusted 20 medical service price items such as dental implant implantation.
Li Yunjie, director of the Medical Price and Tendering and Procurement Department of the Zhengzhou Medical Insurance Bureau: There are four main beneficiaries. One is medical insurance, which will see less spending; the pressure on hospitals will be reduced, and the number of patients will increase appropriately; suppliers will gain a market; and we patients are the ones who benefit the most, as the cost of implanting a tooth may be halved or even more.

“New variables” emerge in China’s e-commerce industry. How can we achieve “content is king” when selling products?
-China News Service
China News Service, February 11, titled: &quot;New variables&quot; emerge in China&#39;s e-commerce industry, how to achieve &quot;content is king&quot; in selling products?
Xia Bin, China News Service reporter
“We entered the e-commerce market relatively late, but we realized from the beginning that content is very important if we want to stand out from thousands of stores.
Fangfang, a post-90s girl from Guangdong, now runs a nourishing food store on Douyin e-commerce, making an offline store with more than 30 years of history flourish online.
Imitating the tone of old Hong Kong movies and accompanied by classic Cantonese songs, open the Douyin account of @芳芳壹食, and the exquisite videos will be refreshing.
At the Douyin e-commerce &quot;Looking for Companions and Sharing High-quality Content&quot; event held recently, Fangfang spoke as a representative of high-quality creators and introduced her daily creative experiences and insights.
She said at the event: &quot;The carefully polished video has attracted a lot of attention from netizens. Many people are interested in my family&#39;s ingredients and want to cook delicious food together, so the sales have opened up all of a sudden.
”
Fangfang has made more people fall in love with the &quot;taste of old Guangzhou&quot; through her soup-making videos. She has sold up to 300,000 pieces of nutritious ingredients in one live broadcast, saving her family&#39;s old store which was on the verge of bankruptcy.
&quot;No content, no e-commerce.&quot; With the continuous development of short videos and live streaming e-commerce, people&#39;s requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early stages of live streaming e-commerce, live streaming rooms often used low prices and discounts to attract users, and price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, there have been phenomenal big Vs such as Liu Genghong and Oriental Selection, as well as many unknown experts and businesses that have emerged in vertical segments. They have improved their long-term operating efficiency by continuously creating high-quality content that is in line with their brand tone.
Gao Yaxuan, head of operations for celebrity authors on Douyin e-commerce, said that in the past year, 6.27 million creators monetized their content through Douyin e-commerce, with their content creation volume increasing by 252% and total transaction volume more than doubling.
“Behind these figures, we can feel a thriving and vibrant author ecosystem.
Gao Yaxuan said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the &quot;E-commerce Industry Content Ecological Health Index (ECHI) Report&quot;, which analyzed the importance of the &quot;new variable&quot; in the current e-commerce industry - high-quality content from a data dimension, and used the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.
According to the e-commerce industry content ecological health index ranking in the above report, Douyin E-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com ranked in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (professionally produced content) and UGC (user-generated content) are high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the consumption and promotion scenarios will be, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation will be, and the stronger the commercial value will be. The proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption that is gradually integrated and distributed in the public and private spheres will also be higher.
At the scene, Yu Guoming, professor of the School of Journalism and Communication of Beijing Normal University and chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Professional Committee, analyzed and interpreted the report.
He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from the &quot;consumer accessibility&quot; stage to the &quot;consumer quality&quot; stage, and high-quality, professional and differentiated content is the &quot;hard currency&quot; of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and driving force for the new stage of e-commerce development. PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, KOL (key opinion leaders), etc. has begun to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.
One is to promote the overall improvement of the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecosystem from the perspective of improving the content structure, create positive content creation and management standards, and achieve a healthy system index and dynamic balance in the e-commerce industry&#39;s content ecosystem.
The other is to look at the external ecology and achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.
&quot;In the future, the e-commerce industry will need more support from data and artificial intelligence to form predictions on the stability of future development. In addition, it will provide merchants with a more standardized and healthy growth space, realize the value synergy of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and jointly create a healthy content ecosystem.

&quot;At the opening ceremony of the seminar for new members and alternate members of the Central Committee and major provincial and ministerial leaders on studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws governing modernization, and systematically expounded on a series of major relationships that need to be properly handled in practice, providing us with a scientific methodology for vigorously promoting Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization, and is related to all aspects of party governance, state governance, military governance, internal affairs, diplomacy, and national defense. We must not only make good systematic plans, but also be brave in reform and innovation to continuously achieve overall advancement.
To carry out top-level design, we need to have a deep insight into the general trend of world development, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, and deeply explore the laws of economic and social development, so that the formulated plans and policy systems reflect the times, grasp the laws, and be creative, and achieve a combination of long-term and short-term goals, a connection between the top and the bottom, and coordinated content.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory undertaking. There are still many unknown areas. We need to boldly explore in practice and promote the development of the cause through reform and innovation. We must never stick to the old ways or sit back and wait for opportunities.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party and a country.
To advance Chinese-style modernization, we must enhance the foresight of our strategy, foresee and lead the future with a scientific strategy; we must enhance the overall nature of our strategy, focus on solving major issues that are related to the success or failure of the cause of the Party and the country, and that have a far-reaching impact on the entire body; we must enhance the stability of our strategy, and once a strategy is formed, we must adhere to it for a long time, carry it through to the end, and ensure its success.
We must scientifically grasp the dialectical unity between strategy and tactic, organically combine the principle of strategy with the flexibility of tactic, be flexible, adaptable, and make decisions on the spot, and seize the strategic initiative by adapting to local conditions, acting in accordance with the situation, and taking advantage of the trend.
The Chinese nation is a nation that upholds the truth and innovates.
To handle the relationship between upholding the truth and innovation well, we must not only safeguard the origin, source, root and soul of Chinese-style modernization, unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements, and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, and ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization, but also place innovation in a prominent position in the overall national development, adapt to the requirements of the development of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively recognize, respond to and seek change, vigorously promote reform and innovation, constantly create new development momentum and new advantages, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important foundation for fairness, and fairness is a powerful guarantee for efficiency.
In advancing Chinese-style modernization, we must not only create higher efficiency than capitalism, but also more effectively maintain social equity, and better achieve the balance, promotion and unity of efficiency and equity.
We must handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness well, continuously realize development for the people, development relying on the people, and the fruits of development shared by the people, so that the fruits of modernization can benefit all the people more and more equitably.
To advance China&#39;s modernization, we need to handle the relationship between vitality and order well, so that society is both full of vitality and stable and orderly.
We must coordinate the two major issues of development and security, implement the overall national security concept, improve the national security system, enhance the ability to safeguard national security, and firmly safeguard the security of the state regime, system, ideology and key areas.
We should not only give more consideration to security factors in the course of development, enhance national security strength through development, and use development achievements to consolidate the foundation of national security, but also be good at creating a safe environment conducive to economic and social development, constantly stimulate development vitality, and achieve a virtuous interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
To advance China&#39;s modernization, we must not only adhere to our own path, but also broaden our global vision, persist in opening up to the outside world, and constantly expand the breadth and depth of China&#39;s modernization.
We must adhere to independence, self-reliance and self-strengthening, base the development of the country and nation on our own strength, and keep the destiny of our country&#39;s development and progress firmly in our own hands.
We must continue to expand high-level opening-up, deeply participate in global industrial division of labor and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space of China&#39;s modernization, share development opportunities and create a better future in mutual benefit and win-win results.
Only by following the right path can you go far.
Let us, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core and the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, grasp the laws, act steadfastly, give full play to our enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity, correctly handle a series of major relationships, work hard on the new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way, and constantly open up new horizons for Chinese-style modernization.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) The Biden administration blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of being involved in the spy balloon program on Friday (February 10).
The U.S. Commerce Department said the five Chinese companies and one research institute are helping modernize the Chinese military, particularly aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Blacklisted companies have difficulty accessing U.S. technology exports.
The list is called the &quot;entity list,&quot; and companies on it will not be able to purchase technology or goods from American suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group Corporation&#39;s 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Prior to this, the White House said it was considering taking broader measures to &quot;expose and address&quot; China&#39;s larger surveillance activities that threaten US national security.
The balloon incident caused further tensions between China and the United States, and US Secretary of State Blinken canceled his visit to China.
The United States shot down the balloon on February 4. The Chinese government lodged a solemn representation to the U.S. Embassy in China, criticizing the United States for seriously impacting and damaging the efforts and progress of both sides to stabilize Sino-U.S. relations.
Based on the existing wreckage evidence and information from the Chinese military&#39;s procurement platform, the U.S. government concluded that the balloon&#39;s manufacturer &quot;has a direct relationship with the Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army&quot; and is a supplier approved by the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position on the accidental incident in which a Chinese unmanned airship mistakenly entered U.S. airspace due to force majeure.
She added that the relevant resolution of the US Congress was pure political manipulation and hype, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
China expresses strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this.
&quot;Today&#39;s action demonstrates our concerted efforts to identify and disrupt China&#39;s use of spy balloons that violate the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries,&quot; said Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement.
”
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said he was unaware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet commented on the information.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) Several days have passed since the earthquake struck parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is becoming increasingly slim. However, the family of five rescued on Saturday made the search and rescue workers feel extremely relieved.
According to the Associated Press, the family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in the hard-hit town of Noorday in Gaziantep province.
Rescuers first pulled the mother and daughter out of the rubble, and then found the father, but he insisted on saving his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, cheers broke out among the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued in severe cold weather conditions.
&quot;What day is today?
&quot;- The teenager who was trapped under the rubble for 129 hours asked the rescuers who rescued him after being brought back to the ground.

The miraculous successful rescue case brought a ray of hope to the search and rescue work, which had already been hopeless. However, at the same time, the death toll continued to rise.
According to official statistics, Monday&#39;s earthquake has killed more than 20,000 people in Türkiye, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be more than 3,500.
Although experts say people trapped in the rubble can survive for more than a week, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly slim.
Rescuers are still using thermal imaging cameras to search for signs of life beneath the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of rescue efforts began to shift to helping survivors in urgent need of help.
UN official: The region&#39;s disaster is &#39;unprecedented in a century&#39;
Martin Griffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said at a press conference in Turkey that the earthquake was &quot;the worst disaster in a century&quot; to hit the region.
He also praised Türkiye&#39;s post-disaster response as &quot;extraordinary.&quot;
He also told Reuters he hoped to deliver aid to areas controlled by both the Syrian government and opposition, but said that was &quot;still unclear&quot;.
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in relief aid to earthquake-stricken people in Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced $25 million in disaster relief for Türkiye and Syria.

Google AI chatbot &quot;answered the wrong question&quot; and the parent company&#39;s stock price evaporated by $100 billion
(Comprehensive 11th)
Google&#39;s newly launched artificial intelligence chatbot Bard got off to a bad start after &quot;answering questions incorrectly&quot; in a promotional video, causing the share price of Google&#39;s parent company Alphabet to plummet 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark and evaporating $110 billion (about RM476.5 billion) in market value. As of the close of Friday, it was trading at $94.57.
The market is concerned that Alphabet is lagging behind its rival Microsoft.
According to Reuters, Google earlier released a promotional video of the AI chatbot Bard on social media. In the video, someone asked Bard: &quot;What new discoveries can I tell my 9-year-old child about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)?
In his response, Bard mentioned that the telescope had taken the first picture of a planet outside our solar system.
However, according to NASA, the first photo of an exoplanet was taken in 2004 by the European Southern Observatory&#39;s Very Large Telescope.
Reuters even reported it with the title &quot;Alphabet shares plummet after Bard&#39;s wrong answer.&quot;
On the other hand, Google noted that Bard&#39;s response &quot;highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process&quot; and that it would combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard&#39;s response &quot;meets high standards for quality, safety, and factual information.&quot;

The Tourism Board recently announced that it plans to allocate S$110 million from this budget over the next two years to launch more business and leisure activities to attract return tourists.
In order to make health and wellness one of Singapore’s tourism highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board launched a call for expressions of interest on November 23, 2022, to develop a health and wellness attraction on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, executive director of sports and wellness tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have put physical health at the top of their considerations.
Developing a health and wellness attraction in Marina South, which is home to Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore&#39;s tourism and economy, encouraging tourists to spend more and stay longer in Singapore.
Singapore Tourism Board Director General Tan Jianlong said that in the next few years, health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore&#39;s tourism products.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the public&#39;s awareness of and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourism Board has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists over the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held its first Health and Wellness Festival, providing the public with more than 130 health activities and experiences of various types.
Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences to tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children&#39;s Museum, Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, Sentosa Central Beach Market, the new &quot;Explore New Frontiers&quot; exhibition hall at the ArtScience Museum and the new open-air theatre at the Night Safari, the Tourism Board will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Wildlife World&#39;s Bird Park, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will formulate relevant industry standards for the sustainable development of the conference, exhibition and incentive tourism industry by 2023, and focus on improving the two major issues of waste disposal and carbon emissions to further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore&#39;s tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
Data shows that as of December 18, 2022, Changi Airport&#39;s passenger traffic has recovered strongly, receiving as many as 150,000 passengers per day and about 1 million passengers per week, equivalent to about 75% of the pre-pandemic level. The number of aviation industry employees on the job has also recovered to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million passengers, equivalent to 42% of the pre-epidemic level, and 170,000 flights taking off and landing, which is 53% of the pre-epidemic level.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also driven the recovery of industries such as accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping.
The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Koh Shudan, assistant director of the International Division of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that a survey conducted by a Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore&#39;s safety index ranked among the top three in the world, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is so popular among Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3.6 million Chinese people traveled to Singapore for vacation every year.
As China relaxes its border policies, the number of Chinese tourists is expected to recover to 30% to 60% of 2019 this year.
Ke Shudan pointed out that in the future, the Tourism Bureau will closely monitor further signals released by China regarding outbound travel policies to respond to changes in tourists&#39; demand.
In addition to strengthening its partnership with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in Chinese outbound travel.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that as long as the global economy does not experience a significant recession that affects public income and there are no new large-scale and deadly epidemic outbreaks, the tourism industry will recover faster than expected.
Kim Jong-un and his daughter interacted intimately, while his wife was left out
(Comprehensive News on the 11th) North Korea held a military parade to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Army&#39;s Day on the evening of the 8th. Leader Kim Jong-un&#39;s daughter Kim Ju-ae not only attended, but also stood on the rostrum with her father.
North Korea&#39;s official media released a video on the 9th. Kim Joo-ae snuggled up to her father, looked at him tenderly several times, and whispered to him. She gently held her father&#39;s cheeks with both hands and even touched his chest. The interaction between father and daughter was broadcast across the country.
However, First Lady Ri Sol-ju could only step aside.
According to reports from South Korea&#39;s &quot;North Korea News&quot; and other media, in the official photo of Kim Jong-un and Ri Sol-ju attending a dinner on the 7th with their daughter Kim Ju-ae, Kim Ju-ae not only sat in the C position between her parents, which was rare, but she also went on the podium with Kim Jong-un at the 75th anniversary parade of the Army&#39;s Day the next evening.
North Korea’s official media, Korea Central Television, later released footage of the military parade, revealing more scenes of the loving father and daughter.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the podium. The smiles on their faces never faded. They also whispered in each other&#39;s ears. Kim Joo-ae once held her father&#39;s cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
Other official media footage also showed that while Kim Joo-ae and Kim Jong-un were sitting on a sofa chair indoors, she kept touching her father&#39;s face with her hands; while she was walking arm in arm with her father, she touched Kim Jong-un&#39;s chest with her hand.
First Lady Ri Sol-ju could only walk behind or sit aside throughout the entire process, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Joo-ae made her first public appearance during the test launch of the Hwasong-17 missile on November 18 last year, her exposure rate has been increasing over the past three months, and this is her fifth appearance in formal occasions.
North Korean state media referred to Kim Ju-ae using highly honorific titles such as &quot;dearest son&quot; and &quot;honored son&quot;. It also broadcast a clip of Kim Ju-ae repeatedly shouting that she would &quot;support the Paektu bloodline to the death&quot; while overlooking the military parade from the stands.
These signs have led the outside world to wonder whether Kim Ju-ae has already been designated as the successor to the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that &quot;this is a signal that Kim Jong-un is pushing his middle school-age daughter to the position of successor.&quot; However, there are also views that such a judgment is still premature, and that as Kim Jong-un already has a son, various possibilities remain.
Chongyang Q&amp;A | How to view the US January non-farm payrolls data that exceeded expectations and future trends - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
Q: I would like to ask Zhongyang Investment, what do you think about the US January non-farm payroll data that exceeded expectations and future trends?
A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released non-farm employment data for January 2023, with 517,000 new non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years; the hourly wage growth rate was 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, a slight slowdown.
From a total perspective, the data are disturbed by many one-off and technical factors, such as faculty and staff returning to work after a strike, revisions to the survey and statistical scope, and updates to seasonal adjustment factors. There may be subsequent revisions (refer to the January 2022 non-farm payrolls, which were revised down from 504,000 to 364,000), and non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data shows.
From a structural perspective, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; new employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care has rebounded significantly, and data shows that the labor gap in the service industry still exists.
Combined with the also-far-than-expected service industry PMI, the rebound in job vacancies and labor shortage data, and the strong consumer credit data, we judge that the U.S. service industry has experienced a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the supply and demand tightness in the U.S. job market will be difficult to improve without a recession.
Currently, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the U.S. labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 year olds has approached its pre-epidemic high.
In addition, due to the excess savings and strong consumer credit of US residents, strong consumer demand will cause the impact of tightening policies on the job market to lag further.
The continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the underlying tone of the U.S. economy in 2023.
In addition, as the interest rate hike is about to end and inflation expectations continue to fluctuate, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Before the release of this data, the U.S. stock, bond and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Fed&#39;s path of interest rate hikes.
As inflation data continues to improve, the Federal Reserve has shortened the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining a fragile balance in market inflation expectations. However, the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed&#39;s hawkish statements, and not only expects an early halt to rate hikes, but also expects two rate cuts by the end of the year.
With the supply and demand in the labor market tight and the impact of tightening policies unclear, we believe that the Fed&#39;s guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. Adjustments to extreme market expectations and trading congestion may cause some damage to the market.
Despite this, the stubborn wage growth rate cannot change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-item leading indicators, the US CPI data has shifted to a rapid decline since October. The stubborn wage growth rate will only provide a bottom line for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.
Shanshan founder Zheng Yonggang passed away due to sudden heart disease. He once led the transformation of China&#39;s first clothing stock - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
Economic Observer reporter Zheng Yuexin reported on February 11 that the WeChat official account of the certified entity, Suning Holdings Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Suning Holdings&quot;), published an obituary that Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Suning Enterprise and chairman of Suning Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to ineffective treatment of sudden heart disease.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of a state-owned cotton spinning mill. With his transfer, in 1989 Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd.
In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Conference of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd Annual Conference of China&#39;s Future Stars, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the 1990s, the market share of the Shanshan brand in China&#39;s suit market was as high as 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan Holdings Group (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China&#39;s apparel industry.
Just when the clothing business was booming, Shanshan Group began to transform because Zheng Yonggang realized that &quot;once the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and it is unlikely that Shanshan suits will always be the leader and become the national clothing of the Chinese people for a long time.&quot;
In 1999, Shanshan began to study corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, &quot;We came to Shanghai to find out what kind of transformation we should do. We found many experts and scholars and held a series of Zhuge Liang meetings and seminars.
Finally, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is the future of big health.&quot;
After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute, which was supporting Anshan Iron and Steel, was working on the National 863 Project and did not have enough research funds. So Shanshan and the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the National 863 Project &quot;Intermediate Phase Carbon Microspheres&quot; project, engage in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and realize the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.
In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. achieved large-scale production of mesophase carbon microspheres and began domestic substitution, replacing Japan as the main supplier of mesophase carbon microspheres in China.
This is China&#39;s first lithium-ion battery negative electrode material production company, realizing the localization of lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials.
With the rapid popularization of lithium battery applications, Shanshan’s lithium battery business began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into Shanshan’s main business. The proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year until 2013, when Shanshan’s lithium battery material business revenue exceeded that of the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chem&#39;s polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer company Shanjin Optoelectronics. This field has a relatively high technical content. Shanshan&#39;s main competitors are all Fortune 500 companies, such as South Korea&#39;s Samsung, Japan&#39;s Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management: &quot;The success rate of Chinese private enterprises acquiring some international high-tech companies is relatively low. Why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone would think, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to take care of it, right? This is a common behavior.&quot; However, Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day when Shanshan&#39;s acquisition was successfully completed, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanjin Optoelectronics and announced publicly that Shanshan, as Shanjin&#39;s major shareholder, decided to implement &quot;one company, two systems&quot;. In addition to Zheng Yonggang serving as chairman, Shanshan&#39;s people would not be sent to Shanjin, and the authorized operation method would be adopted. The original distribution system, corporate culture, and various management models would remain unchanged.
ICC Xinrong Information released the 2022 negative electrode data showing that Shanshan negative electrode shipments exceeded 200,000 tons in 2022, a year-on-year increase of 100%, with a market share of 16%, and artificial graphite negative electrode material shipments ranked first again.
In the polarizer business, statistics from Yano Research show that the company&#39;s Sugin Optoelectronics&#39; global market share reached 29% in 2022, and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Suning Holdings Group&#39;s revenue was 15.841 billion yuan and its net profit was 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, Suning Holdings Group&#39;s share price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Shanshan Holdings Group stated on an interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company&#39;s effective graphitization capacity will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphitization capacity of the Meishan project is still increasing.
Wind shows that Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Suning Holdings Group.
Tianyancha shows that Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1% of the total shares of Suning Holdings Group Co., Ltd.
The general manager of Shanshan Holdings is Li Zhihua, born in 1968. He has served as chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Materials Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co., Ltd.
On February 10, Suning Holdings Group stated on the investor interaction platform that there is no family relationship between the company&#39;s senior management and the company&#39;s actual controller.
&quot;Fund E-account&quot; is here: CSRC authorizes the development of all funds under the name of investors to realize the collection and query - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
Economic Observer reporter Chen Shan: The complicated channels for purchasing funds make it difficult to collect account information?
Always forgetting about the “secret fund”?
These problems of the Christian Democrats will soon be resolved.
On February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the &quot;Fund E-Account&quot; APP was launched on various mobile application stores and started public trial operation.
According to reports, &quot;Fund E Account&quot; provides individual investors with a &quot;one-stop&quot; query service for public fund accounts and share information, aiming to solve industry service pain points such as small and medium-sized investors forgetting their accounts and cumbersome queries.
According to Wind data, as of the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund managers in China, with a total fund size of approximately 26 trillion yuan; there were 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.
The account systems of various share registration institutions are independent of each other, and there is a lack of a unified inquiry channel in the industry.
Industry insiders said that at the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in my country, which means that half of the people in the country had invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to check purchase status through different sales agencies, but through the &quot;Fund E Account&quot;, they can check the purchase status of all sales channels, and the status of fund holdings is clear at a glance.
What is the “Fund E Account” APP?
According to relevant documents, the &quot;Fund E-Account&quot; APP is a mobile phone portal application for the public fund industry developed and constructed by China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It can provide investors with a one-stop query on the over-the-counter share holdings of public fund products across the market.
Investors can use &quot;Fund E Account&quot; to conveniently and quickly understand their holdings of over-the-counter shares of public fund products under various fund managers purchased through various sales channels across the market, thereby comprehensively improving query efficiency.
Specifically, the information that investors can query through &quot;Fund E Account&quot; includes: fund account information opened with public fund managers in the entire market, trading account information opened with public fund sales institutions, and over-the-counter share holdings of products including publicly offered securities investment funds and collective asset management plans established and managed by securities companies with the number of investors not being limited to 200.
Liu Yiqian, business manager of Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Center, told the Economic Observer reporter that investors can use the &quot;Fund E Account&quot; App to obtain one-stop information on all their over-the-counter public fund holdings, helping them to retrieve &quot;forgotten assets&quot;. More importantly, it enables customers to collect full account information on comprehensive fund investment conditions, helping customers to grasp their own investment situation more timely, accurately and completely, so as to better optimize their fund portfolio allocation and better plan their own financial arrangements.
How to register and use?
The reporter noticed that at present, the &quot;Fund E Account&quot; APP has been available on mobile application stores such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, and vivo, but the APP is still in the public trial operation stage. Registration requires filling in an invitation code, and investors can contact the fund manager of the fund they hold to obtain it.
A customer service representative of a medium-to-large public offering fund in Shanghai provided a 6-digit invitation code to the Economic Observer reporter and told the reporter, &quot;During the trial operation phase of the APP, China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager. We will provide them to investors who call to obtain them.
After the trial run is over, the invitation code will no longer be required when user registration is allowed.
”
The reporter registered an account and completed the query according to the download and usage instructions of the &quot;Fund E Account&quot; published on the official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The whole process took only a few minutes and was mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund query.
After passing the real-name authentication step, click the &quot;Asset&quot; fund binding button, and all the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms will be presented in the binding option list (accounts can be bound). After completing the binding, you can intuitively see the total assets of the invested funds and start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the &quot;Fund E Account&quot; only provides inquiry services for investors and cannot be used for subscription, redemption, and trading.
The data date displayed in &quot;Fund E Account&quot; is generally three trading days before the date the user makes an inquiry (T day).
For example, if you open the &quot;Fund E Account&quot; on February 10, the total assets, fund shares, and fund net value displayed on the asset page correspond to the date three trading days before that date, which is February 7.

The United States, Japan and the Philippines reach a defense consensus to fight against the CCP
Asia – On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and held talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP&#39;s invasion of the South China Sea and the East China Sea. The leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement after the meeting, saying that they would conduct substantive defense exchanges and oppose the CCP&#39;s hegemonic policies by signing a trilateral defense agreement with the United States.
According to Japanese media, Kishida Fumio hopes that this meeting will help Japan and the Philippines establish policies to deal with the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos Jr. visited China in early January this year and obtained a deal worth $20 billion.
But after that, China-Philippines relations not only did not improve, but deteriorated instead.
Earlier this month, the Philippines and the United States signed an agreement to open more bases to the US military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
The newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan and is also the closest location to China.
If a crisis arises in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and even the Philippines have now formed an axis with the United States to build an &quot;arc against the CCP&quot; in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan conveyed Song Tao&#39;s words during his visit to China: Under the 1992 Consensus, we welcome the Green Camp to visit the mainland
During his visit to China, Taiwan&#39;s Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan met with China&#39;s Taiwan Affairs Office Director Song Tao and CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee member Wang Huning.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the National Policy Foundation, an official organization of the Kuomintang, was interviewed by Taiwan’s Central News Agency last night and gave a positive evaluation of what Song Tao said to Xia Liyan, saying that as long as they agree with the &quot;1992 Consensus&quot; and oppose Taiwan independence, China welcomes green camp members to visit the mainland.
The Kuomintang considered it to be a new thing.
The news on the day Xia Liyan met Song Tao earlier did not mention this statement.
Taiwan&#39;s ruling Democratic Progressive Party has clarified for several days that it refuses to accept the &quot;1992 Consensus.&quot;
According to the Central News Agency today, Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan led a delegation to visit the mainland. While in Beijing, he met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Yin Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
Xia Liyan met with Song Tao and discussed that the political foundation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the &quot;1992 Consensus&quot; and opposition to Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior consultant of the Kuomintang&#39;s National Policy Foundation, stated at the meeting that the Kuomintang&#39;s &quot;1992 Consensus&quot; is the original &quot;1992 Consensus.&quot;
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this was a different experience from the previous meetings he participated in.
In the recent video conference with mainland academic circles and this conference, I did not hear any Taiwan-related scholars talk about military reunification and the &quot;Anti-Secession Law&quot;. Instead, we talked about resuming exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait is dangerous and the Chinese mainland hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the other side is still willing to do a good job with the Taiwanese people, which means they do not want cross-strait relations to be damaged.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally instructed Song Tao, &quot;You must implement the demands they (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen) put forward.&quot; If a comprehensive solution cannot be achieved, each case must be handled accordingly.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang members mentioned in person during their visit to the mainland the daily harassment of Taiwan by Chinese military aircraft and warships, the agricultural and fishery problems in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, or whether the Central News Agency reporters asked such questions during the interview.
French trade unions once again mobilize to protest against government pension reform plan
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions once again launched a national mobilization against the government&#39;s pension reform bill, calling on the people to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in the social movement against the government&#39;s draft pension system reform.
How many people respond to the call for a rally may affect the union group&#39;s next course of action.
This is the fourth time in a month that France&#39;s eight major trade union groups have jointly launched a national mobilization, and it is also the first time that the protest has scheduled a rally on Saturday.
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people and they do not have to choose between participating in demonstrations or striking by withholding wages, trade union groups hope that today&#39;s rally will attract more people.
The unions of bus, subway and public railway companies did not call for a strike today. The bus system should be able to operate normally and citizens can take the bus to the rally site. At the same time, in areas where schools have started their winter vacation, people can start their vacation normally.
Trade union groups hope that more than one million people will attend the rally today, while police expect participation nationwide to be between 600,000 and 800,000, with 90,000 to 120,000 likely to gather in the Paris metropolitan area.
Since the protests against the government&#39;s pension reform plan began, although polls show that most French people do not support the measure to postpone the statutory retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets to participate in the march has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on January 31st attracted between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people across the country.
By Tuesday (February 7), the number of demonstrators had shrunk to between 757,000 and two million people nationwide.
The pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially the opposition group led by the radical left, submitted numerous amendment proposals, so that the review process was very slow.
The debate between the government and the opposition has become increasingly fierce and sharp.
A member of the radical left-wing France Inbow party recently posted a picture on social media of himself standing on a balloon with the labor minister&#39;s portrait printed on it, sparking protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly eventually announced a 15-day ban on the MP from participating in parliamentary activities as punishment for this behavior.
Although the reform plan has triggered the largest social unrest in France in more than 20 years, the government has so far made slight adjustments to the draft but has not made any major concessions.
The unions are preparing to launch another action next Thursday, the 16th, and they also plan to organize demonstrations on March 7th when the reform draft is submitted to the Senate for discussion.
China encourages raising fertility rate, urging colleges to raise sperm donation quality standards
The Yunnan Human Sperm Bank in China issued a notice on the 9th, soliciting sperm donations from those with college degree or above or from students at school. A subsidy of RMB 4,500 will be awarded for successful donations of 8 to 12 times.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message became a hot topic on Weibo that day, and triggered follow-up initiatives in many provinces and cities including Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
According to a report by the Liberty Times, China encourages college students to donate sperm.
Among the universities across the country, Beijing has the highest threshold for sperm donation. In addition to academic qualifications, it also requires height above 170 cm, regular facial features, no obvious hair loss, and myopia not exceeding 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Human Sperm Bank pointed out that sperm donors can get a full set of men&#39;s physical examinations worth 1,000 yuan, &quot;especially semen and chromosome testing, which most people have never done and is of great significance for understanding their own fertility status.&quot;
The requirements for sperm donors include being over 165 cm tall, having a college degree or above or being a student, and not having color blindness, color weakness, hepatitis B or other genetic or infectious diseases.
The report quoted China Tianmu News as saying that the Shaanxi Human Sperm Bank printed a promotional poster with the words &quot;Paid sperm donation, infinite glory&quot;, calling on young people to respond to sperm donation and encouraging netizens to forward related information to &quot;spread love.&quot;
The price in Shaanxi Province is higher than that in Yunnan. Qualified candidates can receive RMB 300 in cash each time, and those who complete a certain number of sperm donations can receive a subsidy of RMB 5,000.
The highest known price is in Beijing, where the maximum subsidy is 5,150 yuan.
East Germany&#39;s last communist chancellor dies today
The successor to the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that “Hans Modrow left us last night at the age of 95.
As a result, our party has lost an important leader.
”
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, came down, Modrow had said he would help turn East Germany into a democracy.
At the time, communist leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
After coming to power in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev called for changes in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results resulted in him no longer being prime minister.
Despite Modelo&#39;s reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay political change and unification, which was to take place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reshape, rather than abolish, the secret police.
In 1993, Modelo was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but he was not jailed.
There are claims the charges are politically motivated.
Modrow went on to serve in the German Parliament from 1990 to 1994 and as a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modro saw himself as a reformer and wanted to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old East Germany to return but said its achievements should be recognised.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader in a youth fire brigade, and near the end of the conflict became a member of the Nazi militia, the Volkssturm, which conscripted men aged 16 to 60 to fight in the final struggle of the war.
At 17, Modrow was captured by Soviet troops and taken as a prisoner of war to the Soviet Union, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a committed Communist.
He returned in 1949, the year East Germany was founded, found work as a mechanic and went on to study social sciences and economics, earning a doctorate.
Modrow was a functionary of the Free German Youth Movement, to which nearly all young people in East Germany belonged, and rose through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) from 1973 to 1989 to become chairman of the party in the Dresden region.
He also served in East Germany&#39;s parliament for more than 30 years.
In 1990 Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state post.
Iran marks revolution anniversary as hackers support protests, hacks president&#39;s TV address
The Islamic Republic held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised address by President Ebrahim Raisi.
The president&#39;s live televised speech was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute, and the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers named &quot;Edalat Ali&quot; (Justice Ali) appeared on the screen.
A voice was also heard shouting &quot;Death to the Islamic Republic&quot;.
Hackers disrupted state television coverage as Iran marked the anniversary of its revolution, Reuters reported today.
As Iran officially marks the 44th anniversary of the revolution, Raisi&#39;s hardline government faces its boldest challenge yet from young protesters who are demanding their resignation, but Raisi still called on &quot;deceived youth&quot; to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran&#39;s supreme leader.
Nationwide protests are still sweeping Iran after 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the country&#39;s morality police in September.
Iranian security forces have launched a deadly crackdown on the protests, one of the most powerful challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since a 1979 revolution toppled a 2,500-year-old monarchy.
Iranian authorities on Friday released jailed dissident Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha on hunger strike as part of an amnesty marking the anniversary of the revolution.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a general amnesty that included some prisoners arrested in recent anti-government protests.
Human rights group HRANA reported that as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
Reports said 70 government security personnel were also killed.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have called for a vote at Saturday&#39;s rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On Friday night, the anniversary of Iran&#39;s revolution, state media showed fireworks as part of government-sponsored celebrations as people chanted &quot;Allahu Akbar!
(God is greatest!)”.
However, many people at the rally could also be heard shouting “Death to the dictator!
” and “Death to the Islamic Republic” in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage from official rallies in states across the country.
In Tehran, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military hardware were displayed as part of official celebrations.
President Lacey&#39;s speeches were frequently interrupted by chants of &quot;Death to America&quot; - a signature slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted &quot;Death to Israel&quot;.
Reuters said Adelkhah, who has been in jail since 2019, was one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in deteriorating relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on national security charges.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she was back in jail.
Adelkhah denied the allegations.
Mesami&#39;s release came a week after supporters warned he was at risk of death due to his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against mandatory headscarf.
The French Foreign Ministry responded to Adelkhah&#39;s release on Friday by calling for her freedom to be restored, &quot;including being allowed to return to France if she wishes.&quot;

Will the balloon incident open America&#39;s eyes further?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
The Wall Street Journal reported today that after the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials said the balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China and will build more political support for stronger protections of U.S. technology.
The United States said the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communications.
That&#39;s according to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official who now works at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
&quot;This undoubtedly adds fuel to the fire and supports the views of those who are hawkish on China.&quot;
“We will also be considering broader actions to expose and respond to China’s larger surveillance activities that pose a threat to our national security and to our allies and partners,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday.
U.S. officials said they have informed governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident and that international coordination is critical to responding to the Chinese threat.
In addition to the Biden administration’s actions, the new House Select Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party could also pressure the U.S. to take tougher steps to slow China’s development, said Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
She said members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn could force the White House to adopt tougher policies.
The Wall Street Journal said that many people who advocate stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also developing a foreign investment review program to examine whether U.S. overseas investments pose potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to roll out the plan more quickly.
Turkey-Syria earthquake relief efforts continue day and night
Since the strong earthquake struck Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working day and night in the ruins of thousands of destroyed buildings to rescue survivors buried under the rubble.
In freezing temperatures, they frequently called for silence as they strained to hear any sounds of life from the crumbling pile of concrete.
Two more women have been rescued after surviving in the earthquake rubble for days, Reuters reported today.
However, the death toll from the earthquake climbed to 24,150.
The death toll in Türkiye is 20,665, and in Syria it is over 3,500.
Monday&#39;s 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which continued with several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh-deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan&#39;s 2011 earthquake and tsunami and approaching the 31,000 deaths from a 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similarly powerful earthquake in northwestern Türkiye in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Rescuers pulled two women from the rubble of a collapsed building in Turkey after they were trapped for 122 hours following the region&#39;s deadliest earthquake in 20 years, authorities said on Saturday.
Another injured man was identified as Masallah Cicek, 55, who was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In freezing temperatures, rescuers frequently called for silence as they strained to hear any sounds of life emerging from the crumbling pile of concrete.
In Turkey&#39;s Samandag district, rescuers crouched under a slab of concrete, whispering &quot;Inshallah&quot; - &quot;God bless&quot; - as they carefully reached into the rubble and rescued a 10-day-old newborn.
His eyes widened as baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a thermal blanket and carried to the field hospital.
Video images showed emergency workers also taking away his mother, who was dazed and pale but conscious on a stretcher.
Turkey&#39;s Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been pulled from the rubble in the past 24 hours, with 31,000 rescue workers deployed in the affected areas.
He said about 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people left homeless by the quake were crammed into makeshift shelters.
With many people lacking food in freezing winter conditions, questions are growing about the two countries&#39; leaders&#39; response to the disaster.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad traveled to a hospital in Aleppo with his wife Asma, reportedly his first visit to the affected area since the earthquake, according to Syrian state media.
Earlier, the World Food Program said it was running out of stocks in rebel-held northwest Syria as the state of war complicated relief efforts.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Türkiye&#39;s Adıyaman province, where he acknowledged that the government&#39;s response had not been as fast as expected.
Opponents have seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who is up for re-election in a May 14 vote that could be delayed because of the disaster.
Reuters said anger over delays in delivering aid and launching rescue efforts could affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the toughest challenge to Erdogan&#39;s two decades in power.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called a &quot;negative campaign for political gain.&quot;
Türkiye&#39;s main opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu criticized the government&#39;s response.
The criticism stated, “The earthquake was big, but what was worse than the earthquake was the lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence.

Hanoi (VNA) - Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD) on the morning of February 11 during their visit to Brunei Darussalam.
The University of Brunei Darussalam is Brunei&#39;s largest centre for higher education and scientific research and is ranked third in the region&#39;s university rankings.
The University of Brunei Darussalam is one of the symbols of cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei in education and training.
The University of Brunei officially established a cooperative relationship with FPT University of Vietnam in July 2013, with the main area of cooperation being English training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, German, Japanese and Korean, the University of Brunei Darussalam has also included Vietnamese in its teaching curriculum.
During their visit to the University of Brunei, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife exchanged views with students of the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is pleased that more and more foreigners like to learn Vietnamese, which in turn makes a positive contribution to promoting the image of Vietnamese culture and customs around the world.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh expressed his belief and hope that the Vietnamese language teaching team at the University of Brunei will become increasingly stronger; that the students in the Vietnamese language classes will become more and more interested in Vietnamese, study hard, be able to speak fluent Vietnamese as soon as possible, and become messengers of friendly cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
Taking this opportunity, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also communicated via video with Vietnamese students who are studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Da Nang City to learn about their learning situation, especially during the epidemic.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh believes that the partnership between FPT University of Vietnam and the University of Brunei Darussalam, especially the FPT-UBD Global Center, is a vivid symbol of the educational cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
At the same time, I hope that the students of the center will make greater progress in their studies and make positive contributions to the friendly and cooperative relations between Vietnam and Vietnam.
During discussions with the Minister of Education of Brunei and the leaders of the University of Brunei Darussalam, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly appreciated the achievements made in educational cooperation between the two countries, including the cooperation between FPT University and the University of Brunei Darussalam, and the University of Brunei Darussalam&#39;s initiative to include Vietnamese in its teaching curriculum.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh hopes that the University of Brunei Darussalam will continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the scale of Vietnamese language classes.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also highly appreciated the positive results achieved by the cooperation between the two countries on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding on Education Cooperation signed in April 2014. He suggested that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Programme and the Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly appreciated the establishment of the first branch of the University of Brunei Darussalam in Southeast Asia in Vietnam; believed that the university will grow stronger in the region and the world; and further expand its cooperation with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
Taking this opportunity, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife planted a memorial tree on the campus of Brunei University and left a message in the memorial book.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh wished that the University of Brunei Darussalam would continue to move forward, make greater contributions to Brunei&#39;s education, and develop deeper and broader cooperation with various Vietnamese educational and training institutions.

What exactly was the &#39;object&#39; shot down over Alaska?
Confusing and full of speculation
The U.S. military once again used its most advanced stealth jet fighter, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska on Friday afternoon (February 10).
The downing took place ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time the US military has shot down a flying object in less than a week.
A spy balloon from China was shot down near the coast of South Carolina last Saturday after drifting in U.S. airspace for several days.
The Pentagon said the second object shot down first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday evening and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet). It was about the size of a small car and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also believes that there is no indication that the object is maneuverable.
John Kirby, the White House National Security Council&#39;s strategic communications coordinator, said Friday that while the exact appearance of the high-flying object was unclear, it &quot;poses a legitimate threat to the safety of civilian aircraft.&quot;
Kobe said the object was different from the spy balloon found in the United States and did not have a &quot;payload&quot; hanging on it.
&quot;Calling it an &#39;object&#39; is the best description we can give at this point,&quot; Bryant said.
President Biden listened to the Pentagon&#39;s advice before ordering the object to be shot down, and he made the decision &quot;out of an abundance of caution,&quot; Bryant added.
The official U.S. description of this object can be roughly summarized as: it is about the size of a car, has no joystick, no suspension device, and flies at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But the information still cannot answer basic questions, such as what exactly the object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is carrying out.
Currently, many analyses and speculations on the Internet believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It may be that it came from China, just like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon floating over Latin America, and they are performing some kind of mission in different locations.
Some people also associate this &quot;object&quot; in Alaska with &quot;unidentified flying objects&quot; (UFOs).
The Newsweek report quoted former U.S. Congressman Peter Meijer as saying on Twitter on Friday, &quot;Hopefully this &#39;UFO&#39; is also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO.&quot;
“The irony of conflating an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is amazing, but it’s not worth sparking an interstellar conflict,” Major said.
Major sent the tweet shortly after Bryant confirmed the object had been shot down in Alaska.
Newsweek said Major was not the only one who suspected the object was a UFO.
Republican Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee criticized the government&#39;s cover-up last month and called on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on &quot;unidentified flying objects.&quot;
Amazon&#39;s customer service is unbelievable.
I guess few people have seen this, but I still want to say a few words about it.
When we purchased this piece of clothing, it was a zipper hoodie, but the one they gave me in the end was actually a short-sleeved shirt.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service. At that time, they confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I asked for an exchange, and the customer service said they would sort it out. Then I immediately saw that the product name changed to short-sleeved, and the link I bought was removed from the shelves.
Then the customer service informed me that I could either keep the goods and be compensated a certain amount of money, or return them.
Is this how Amazon handles it?
It is really unbelievable. It is not my fault that the wrong clothes were sent. As a consumer, I demanded the goods that I deserved and did not make any exaggerated requests. However, Amazon changed its name and said that there was no stock.
This is my first long review, and I hope it won&#39;t be my last.
The sleeves are incomprehensible
It is said to be made of cowhide, and it is indeed quite hard, but if you look closely, you can see a lot of tiny cracks in some parts, and it is hard to tell whether it is real leather. Also, the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible. Usually the sleeves of a jacket are longer than the hem, but usually only by 1-2 cm. This dress is 5 cm long. When the arm hangs naturally, it should be at the base of the palm, but the sleeves of this dress cover the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, and returning them is also easy.
But I don’t know when the money will be returned?
The clothes were well made, but because they were a little small, I had to return them. However, more than a week has passed since I returned them, and I still haven&#39;t received a refund?
Moreover, the buyer has to contact Quanfeng Express, which has a low reputation for integrity. This is the worst shopping experience since I bought something from Amazon!
But the store is still good, and actively cooperated and urged the courier to refund the money in time. However, the work done by Quanfeng Express is quite infuriating. It dragged on for about half a month before refunding the money. This kind of partner will drag Amazon down, with poor work efficiency and no service awareness!
More suitable for young people
99 seconds to kill.
The workmanship, color and feel of the wool pants are all good, they are soft, of moderate thickness, and have no kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the style is slim and more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist 2 feet 5, stretched maximum size 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg, the waist is a bit tight when worn.
There seems to be no elastic band at the waist, so it is quite difficult to make the waist looser.
In addition, it is uncomfortable to wear next to the skin.
Very good, the color is not very bright
The price has increased by more than 200 yuan just after I bought it. What is going on?
The first time I cooperated with Amazon, I was not at home when the goods were delivered. Later, I took the initiative to arrange two delivery times with the courier, but the courier still did not deliver the goods. Later, I directly returned the goods to me. This damn courier has no integrity at all. I strongly suggest that you do not use Tiantianlan Express again.
This time, a T-shirt was also returned to me, and the price increased by more than 100 yuan when I auctioned it again.
Amazon&#39;s own sales should not have such products
I bought the product when it was on sale, the price was not low, and judging by the reviews it is a very good product.
When I actually received the product, I was stunned. There were large areas of wear and tear on the surface of the product, and there were wear and tear in many other places. It was either a defective product or an old product. I will post pictures later.
I applied for a return, and the manufacturer&#39;s staff saw the pictures and said it was due to transportation. Isn&#39;t that nonsense?
How is it possible for the inside of the product to be worn out?
There are only two possibilities, either it is a defective or old product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the product. However, based on my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I think such products should not appear in Amazon&#39;s own-operated products. When customers choose Amazon&#39;s own-operated products, it is a trust. Customer wins, we win. The customer&#39;s victory is the manufacturer&#39;s victory. I hope we can work together to improve. Thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year and I have two E2s. I don&#39;t know how to deal with this?
I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two groups on the right side of the receiver often showed red E2. It should be a problem with the transmitter module. This is inconsistent with what Amazon said on the website that the transmitter module can work continuously for 7 years. I can&#39;t find after-sales service on the Amazon website. I don&#39;t know what to do now?
Okay?
The first purchase was a bad one.
It doesn&#39;t feel like new.
The label on the box was torn and the label on the fuselage was also broken.
And it&#39;s always a white screen.
It&#39;s fine after changing it.
The replacement was quite quick, it was a little blurry at night and the viewing angle was not very wide, but it was enough for ordinary home use.
The downside is that I don’t have a card, I bought one myself, and I’ve bought a phone from Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the package to prevent it from being opened, but there was none this time. When you buy the phone, there is also a sticker-like stamp that can be pasted on the warranty card, but there was none this time.
I don’t know if the items are no longer available because they are cheaper. I’m very confused.
Waiting for supplier&#39;s response
There was no marking on the packaging. I called the supplier directly and they said it was authentic if it had no marking. If in doubt I could mail the leftovers to Johnson &amp; Johnson for inspection. They also left their license plate number and phone number and promised to send me a text message to enter my information into the warranty card on the Johnson &amp; Johnson official website. I haven&#39;t received any text message yet?
Received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon&#39;s own products are still very reliable.
The oil changer said the oil was clear and it was indeed good oil.
Because it is the second time I buy it.
So I feel very relieved.
The delivery was fast, the packaging was impeccable, and the engine noise was significantly reduced after using this oil.
The price/performance ratio is good, and it is difficult to find synthetic motor oil under 200 yuan.

Amazon Japan has caused serious damage to buyers&#39; interests due to customer service issues (8c caterpillars are shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
He admitted his mistake but kept shirking responsibility, always emphasizing that the goods belonged to a third party and that he could not restrict the third party.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
The size options on the page when I purchased it were 7c, 8, and 9c. I thought it was a trap at the time, so I called Japan Asian Games’ Chinese customer service and was told clearly that 8 meant 8c. However, when the product arrived in China, I discovered that it was only 8cm. I think this was a deliberate trap set to scam Chinese people (according to Amazon’s after-sales service). Now when I check the page, this option is no longer there.
Chinese customer service: We are sorry for the loss. We have two options for you:
1. You return the product and the buyer is responsible for all shipping costs.
2. If you do not return the product, we will compensate you 1,000 yen.
(Let me do the math. The shoes cost more than 4,000 yen, which is 200 RMB. If I choose 1, I don’t have the shoes, so my loss is 200 RMB.
Option 2, I had shoes, and they finally compensated me 2,000 yen, so the final loss was 150 RMB. Customer service: We have recorded it, we will deal with it seriously. I received an email the next day saying that I do not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service, and that was it.
When I pointed out that the purchase page showed confusing options like 7c, 8, and 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me explain that the commonly used Japanese codes would not have a c, like 140, but have you ever looked at other caterpillar pages?
There are mixed US and Japanese codes.
Besides, why do you put 8cm between 7c and 9c? It is obviously the smallest size, so what&#39;s the point of putting it there?
Chinese customer service: We provide services in Chinese, but we didn’t know you wanted to ship the goods back to China, so we will not compensate you for your shipping costs.
I don&#39;t understand this logic. I am Japanese and I still need Chinese customer service. Chinese people living in Japan don&#39;t need Chinese customer service. Tourists going to Japan don&#39;t have the time to make international long-distance calls. So the question is, who needs to call Amazon&#39;s overseas shopping Chinese phone number? It&#39;s just people like me who shop in Japan.
Doesn’t Amazon’s Chinese customer service make things more convenient for those of us who shop overseas?
Not very satisfied with this purchase
This is the second time I have bought Pampers diapers from Amazon. I bought a box when my baby was 2 months old. I chose diapers with paper imported from Europe. I was quite satisfied with the first purchase experience. My baby only used one diaper all night, and it really lasted for 12 hours without changing the diaper.
But this time I bought L-size diapers, and there were 2 packs of separately packaged diapers in one box. After opening them, I felt that the paper was looser, which was significantly different from the imported Pampers. After using them on my baby, it was okay, with no signs of leakage or rashes.
But when it came to the second pack of diapers, red rashes immediately appeared on the inside of my baby&#39;s thighs after I started using them, and they haven&#39;t gone away yet.
I suspect the two packs in one box are of different quality.
I probably won’t buy it again in the future!
Hope to pay attention to the transportation protection of the package
This is the worst packaging and shipping I have seen in all my online shopping. There are no protective measures at all, no cushioning foam, no wrapping cushioning material, etc., nothing at all.
It&#39;s just a deformed box.
Moreover, the soft plastic box inside was packed and the card box was pressed open and deformed.
I hope it is authentic and of guaranteed quality. I won’t dare to buy things from Amazon anymore.
I would rather it be half as expensive as it is in China so it has more security.
As for the product packaging problem, I saw comments about it in 2016, and now, 19 years later, it is still the same.
This shows that Amazon does not attach importance to service feedback at all, which is far behind domestic companies such as JD.com and Tmall.
Nice, but a little regretful
I really like the color of the whole cup, orange-red. Although I have a boy, I still think that orange-red and yellow are very eye-catching.
It&#39;s smaller than I thought, but it&#39;s acceptable since I&#39;m going to take it out.
I took it home and tried it last night. After pushing open the bottle cap, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the straw is positioned vertically, my son always has to hold the bulge on the cap with his mouth to drink water. I wonder if this area can be improved.
It seems that it makes sense for other brands of sippy cups to have the straws tilted. When it comes to children’s things, safety and comfort are really what matters.
Lightweight and large capacity
I like that it is lightweight and has a large opening, but the two separate compartments are a bit redundant for me, and I don&#39;t know what to put in them.
After buying it, I found out that there was another similar one from another brand on Amazon for less than two hundred yuan.
Fake, very fake
Amazon sells fake goods, I am also convinced.
The customer service said that I couldn’t return the product because I had used it. How could I know it was a fake if I hadn’t used it?
I feel sad because of trust. After all, it is a facial wipe. You should buy it in a physical store. It will surely be more expensive.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn’t read the comments. I have already submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let’s protect our rights together.
broken?
Fake?
Tragedy anyway.
When I used the second piece, I chose the one with fine pores, but there was a strange smell as soon as I opened it. I thought it was normal because I had never used this one. But when I put it on my face, I couldn’t stand it. It had a very pungent smell, which was indescribable. It made me cough immediately, and my eyes hurt and I was crying. I took it off immediately to wash my face.
I didn&#39;t believe it, so I bought another pill of the same kind. It doesn&#39;t have such a strong smell, and I&#39;m applying it now.
Looking back, it smells a bit like the smell of cheap perm lotion in a hair salon.
It’s really hard to imagine. Do we have to stay away from Amazon’s own skin care products from now on?
A profiteer.
When I made the purchase, the event page said that if I spent over 99 yuan, I would get a free copy of &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot;. When I received the product, there was no such gift. I called customer service and they asked me to show them a screenshot of the event. The question is, who would save a screenshot of the web page after buying something? You have done an event yourself, but you still need customers to provide it to you. Buyers, please be careful next time and keep the evidence.
Feeling after use
This is my first time buying something on Amazon, and I have several feelings about it. Let me first talk about my experience after using the product. First, it is indeed painless, and there is no irritating smell. Overall, it is very good. Just wait for about 8 minutes and wipe it off. There will just be a small amount of sweat hair residue on it, which you can&#39;t see unless you look closely. So overall it is good. As for the future, I have only used it once and need to continue to observe. I will know with continued use.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
Second, I placed the order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days, or half a month, and the service attitude of the Amazon deliveryman was also very good.
Third, don’t believe in Amazon’s Black Friday. I placed an order on Friday and waited for two days and the price was nearly 12 yuan cheaper, which means I paid more than 170 yuan (including shipping and so on). It feels like the price is raised because of an event.
The customer service said there were price fluctuations. I&#39;ve been paying attention to the price for more than 10 days and it&#39;s been like this, with not much fluctuation.
Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese label, comes with particles, I will definitely repurchase!
The paste contains particles, and the refreshing feeling is just right. My teeth feel smooth after use. It is much better than a second-hand one I bought on a certain website. They say it is imported, but many things don&#39;t have Chinese labels. I don&#39;t know where they are wholesaled from.
From now on, I will never buy anything I find on Amazon again.
Give me a suggestion, why sometimes I can’t post orders on the Amazon app? I hope they can improve the application and do better and better!
Excellence has been getting worse over the years, and there is no service quality at all!
Garbage Excellence does not take into account customer needs when placing an order with a special delivery time of 19:00-22:00.
Because there is an elderly person at home who is unable to stay in bed after surgery, it is only convenient to receive the mail at night.
As a result, they delivered it directly to my door at 12 noon without any prior phone notification.
If the delivery time is whatever your couriers want, why bother setting a time for customers to choose?
If your own logistics cannot guarantee service, then you should just stop doing e-commerce!
An old man with three wounds on his body was asked to get out of bed, open the door to receive a parcel and pay with change!
There is a contact number on the order form!
From the beginning to the end, no one called to give an explanation!
Joyo.com&#39;s so-called complaint customer service is just a bunch of outsiders pretending to be there, dealing with your complaint perfunctorily and then giving you a so-called reply.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I’ve encountered similar issues like incorrect delivery time before and I tolerated it, but this time I can’t tolerate it, it’s too much!
When the pre-ordered new book arrived, the front and back covers were reversed. This was such an obvious quality issue, yet they just blindly sent the book to the customer?
No one will contact you if you leave a bad review.
Excellence has been getting worse over the years, and there is no service quality at all!
Won&#39;t spend a dime on excellence again.
The picture quality is really unacceptable
As a book with a title like &quot;Ancient Atlas&quot;, the selection, layout and printing of pictures are really unacceptable. Some pictures are even mosaics and are so blurry that they are unrecognizable.
Even though this book is not a professional atlas, even with its small-format illustrations, it should be worthy of the magnificent medieval documentary materials left by our ancestors in the catalog!
(Besides, many pictures can be obtained as clear original files from relevant industry resources). What is the difference between using such pictures to piece together a book and not using pictures at all?
I feel sorry for this kind of academic spirit.
I will not comment on the text, as experts have their own opinions.
Overall 2 stars.
I read this book when I was in my second year of high school. I just read it for fun because I was bored. I felt that I would not be addicted to such a book. After all, the online novels on Qidian.com have not been very attractive to me.
And then... I fell into the pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is relatively light-hearted and enjoyable. In the first part when Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even the intrigues between guilds were not heavy at all because they were often portrayed by Ye Shen.
As for the part about the competition, I wrote about the changing times and the alternation of the old and the new, and a little bit of sadness (maybe I&#39;m just too sentimental).
Reading the whole book took me a lot of study time in my second year of high school, but I just couldn&#39;t stop.
Full-time&#39;s description of characters and emotional lines is amazing. Some characters are only mentioned occasionally, but they also leave a deep impression on people. For example, the characters that are described in more detail, such as Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng, all have a large number of fans, and the characters that are not at the center of the writing, such as Jiang Botao, Chu Yunxiu, etc., are also very likable. In such a cool e-sports article, one cannot find a single extremely annoying character. This is the success of Full-time in character description.
As for the love story, Full-time Works does not have the problem of 30 million beauties in the harem who are either beautiful or gay, as is criticized in other online novels. All the people in the novel have one thing in common: they all like the game of Honor, and most of them want a fair victory.
There are small calculations but no big conspiracy, everyone looks so innocent and cute.
This may also be why there are no annoying characters in Full-time.
The full-time IP is huge, thanks to this.
Putting aside the cultural phenomenon of online literature, Full-time Work is still a good book.
To some extent, he can really provide people with some passion and a little bit of emotion.
I will be working on animation full-time in April this year.
In fact, I have wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but I never made up my mind to buy it because my wallet was never thick enough. Then when I wanted to buy it, I found that there were rampant fakes on tb. In fact, Full-time has recently released another version, and I quite like the cover picture, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I took a look on Amazon and bought the whole set at once.
Next, let me briefly talk about the situation of the goods.
●The fourth book does not have a plastic cover, but the book is new.
●The seventeenth book was in plastic cover but was opened. The texture of the book was strange and it didn’t feel as hard as the others.
●The 23rd book is in the same situation as the 17th book, but it is also harder than the 17th book, but very old.
●The publishers of some of the books are different. It seems that the 23rd and 17th books are from the same publisher, but different from the others.
●Overall, I am quite satisfied. The box of 24 books is quite big and I am quite satisfied.
Lonely little lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as &quot;The Missing Piece&quot;, but it turned out to have a lot of words!
I read this book to the children three times before I finished reading it. It was about a little lion who could shoot a gun and a little lion who loved to eat jelly candies.
When I saw the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urban people find it difficult to accept the arrangement of being eaten by animals.
In the end, this little lion who had succeeded in human society lost himself. He was no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human.
In the end, there was only the back of the little lion, and no one knew where he had gone.
Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the impression of a grown-up child, and when she is reminded of it inadvertently one day, it may touch or inspire her.
Very cost-effective portfolio
1. I didn’t know TASCHEN before, but recently I bought a lot of their books because they are so strong, both in terms of the subject matter and the production itself.
This work has been published in three versions. The largest version is the same as the complete works of Michelangelo, which is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest and comes with two volumes of a book box.
Personally, I think it is acceptable. First, the price is cheap, and the more than 700 pages are divided into two volumes, which are also easier to read as a paperback. Secondly, unlike the complete works of Michelangelo, in which paintings occupy the main body, the black and white manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci occupy the majority. For readers with limited budgets and who are not majoring in art, this edition has the best cost-effectiveness for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.
2. The explanation of the paintings is great, with composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as the Last Supper). However, I don’t know if it’s due to the printing or the size of the book, but some of the shadows are too dark and the details are hard to see, which is a bit regrettable.
3. Compared with Michelangelo&#39;s manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s manuscripts are much richer in content.
The former is already a genius, but the latter&#39;s breadth of knowledge and high achievements do not qualifies him as a genius.
If you could only appreciate half of Leonardo da Vinci by looking at his paintings before, you would be completely speechless after reading his manuscripts.
Rubbish, whoever buys it will regret it!
I never give bad reviews, this one is really rubbish, it&#39;s a waste of money, give me a reason!
1. The time was not accurate, and suddenly it became January 1st, and the time was reset to zero.
2. Poor quality leather belts, not made of silicone, cause allergies and blisters on wrists after wearing them.
3. Often cannot connect to the phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. Sleep detection does not display the time and it is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Others.
Logistics is too slow
It showed that it arrived on October 16th, but I didn’t receive it until the 21st. Bad review!
The express delivery is terrible. Buying things on Amazon is slow to begin with, but I didn’t expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfaction
I was worried about the packaging of the camera at first, but this time it was okay. There was an inflatable bag inside, the three codes of the camera were consistent, and it could be registered on the official website. The shutter count was 0, and the rest I could only wait and see.
The delivery speed was quite fast. I would like to complain about the courier guy here. He left the valuable items at the gate and left very fast. I couldn&#39;t open the box for inspection in front of him. I was speechless about this.
The merchant took the customers into consideration before shipping:)
The merchant was quite responsible and called specifically to ask about the screen size of the camera being used, which really showed consideration for the customers.
The shipping speed is also fast.
The diamond film is also suitable and effective when applied.
Battery not fully charged
The machine is really good. I want to ask why it can&#39;t be fully charged from the first charge, and the charging indicator light is always red.
Currently, I can&#39;t find an official Amazon feedback channel, so I can only give feedback in the product reviews.
1. On March 29, I purchased the book for 31 yuan through pre-order. It was shown that the book would be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book could not be previewed on the Amazon official website (because it had not been released yet);
2. The book pushed to the device on March 31st has a blank content, and only says &quot;stay tuned&quot;. The price of the e-book on Amazon has dropped to 18 yuan.
3. In the past two days, I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank book downloaded on the device and synchronize it again, but I was unable to obtain the electronic version of &quot;The Essence of Business&quot; containing the actual content. However, I saw that the book can be previewed on the Amazon official website.
I have a few thoughts at the moment
1. The price is not the most important issue. The key is how to replace the blank books on the Kindle with books with actual content, instead of always downloading &quot;stay tuned&quot; books.
2. I probably won&#39;t buy the pre-ordered book again. After all, if it&#39;s delayed, downloading a book with empty content will be very complicated.
3. I hope Amazon can provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues, so that when there are doubts about the download or use of e-books, there is a place to feedback (work tickets, online customer service, you can refer to how the Microsoft official store does it)
Not a recommended read
I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it, so I&#39;ll write some thoughts based on my memory.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a collection of fragments about love in life.
The writing style of this book is extremely plain, as plain as boiled water. The choice of words and sentences pursues simplicity to the extreme, and the plot is as quiet and plain as a street in a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a snapshot of a small period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
Finally, they were collected together and titled &quot;What We Talk About When We Talk About Love&quot;.
I think this collection of novels, and its title, is like a kind of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not only the joys and sorrows on the stage, the everlasting love in urban legends, nor is it just the infatuation between you and me. Love is not only the above and should not be represented by the above. Love is also a life as plain as water, boring day after day, helplessness in life, escape from reality, and confusion about the future.
When reading this book, you may recall the quarreling couples around you, the boring marriages of people you know, and the unhappy relationships.
This is exactly why I don&#39;t recommend reading it. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing style and plot of this book are dull. Unless your life is full of turmoil or as sweet as living in a candy castle, you will feel indifferent and bored when reading it.
In terms of ideological depth, the daily plots do not make people&#39;s eyes shine or expand one&#39;s thinking and vision (this is different from Marquez&#39;s &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;). The short clips do not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist&#39;s marriage?
So I don’t recommend reading this book. It doesn’t make much sense whether you read it or not.
The author&#39;s ideas are expressed more through techniques and genres rather than the storyline, which is why the reading experience of this book is relatively poor.
Suitable for quick reading, not careful reading.
The book has good logic, but the content is not rich enough.
It explains a lot of sales theories and why, but is very weak in terms of how to do it. It only points out the direction but does not give specific practices.
Also, the book feels like a patchwork.
The examples given include both domestic and foreign ones; both well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknown people.
I don’t know if this story was compiled for the purpose of giving examples. It would be more convincing if some cases that the author had personally experienced were cited.
The term &quot;customer&quot; or &quot;client&quot; changes frequently.
In the title it is still customer, but in the body of the text it becomes client.
The e-book also contains typos, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering.
In short, this book is a good choice as an introduction to theory, but it is not suitable for people who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.
A quick guide to understanding Internet finance
This book is very shallow and can be said to be just an introductory course. It can help everyone quickly understand the overall picture of Internet finance, but to understand it in depth, you still have to follow the map and dig deeper on your own.
Moreover, the book was written quite early, and it did not mention how Alipay and WeChat later used subsidy wars to cultivate user habits. I am afraid that the current share of third-party payment is not as small as stated in the book.
Nowadays, many people just bring their mobile phones when dining out, and merchants have stopped using UnionPay because of the high bank transaction volume.
But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of experience in financial observation and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.
It is easy to write in a lofty and abstract way, but it is difficult to write in a simple and easy-to-understand way.
I appreciate you and want you to know!
The first factor that determines a person&#39;s job satisfaction is not the salary, but whether he or she is given enough attention and appreciation at work.
According to Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs theory, after people&#39;s basic survival needs are met, the most urgent thing is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for most Chinese people, it is difficult to express their love for you. Even if they have love, gratitude and admiration, they keep it in their hearts and will not say it out loud.
In this book, the author explains five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, thoughtful gifts, and physical touch.
I think what’s important is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages from the bottom of your heart anytime and anywhere to appreciate and be grateful to those around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer the people are to us, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, so that our lives will become better.
By learning to appreciate, companies can retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thanks to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign ideas and world.
Due to reasons such as the cultural backgrounds of China and the West, there will be more or less differences between the languages. If I have the opportunity to read the original version of the author, I believe I will gain more.
Thanks again to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!
Suspected of being a counterfeit product, please Amazon strictly review it
The quality is extremely poor, the packaging is loose and has no weight, even worse than the products sold at roadside stalls, with no weight and no barcode. The packaging of ten bags is also loose, which is not the characteristic of qualified products at all. This is the worst shopping experience on Amazon and I have applied for a return. It is entirely a quality issue. I suggest that merchants keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods. Supplement: I bought Xin Xiangyin again, which costs 23 yuan/10 rolls in the supermarket, and added a few comparison photos to further verify the counterfeiting of this product. In order to give consumers a clearer reference and avoid economic losses and further unhappiness!
Once again, I hope Amazon can be meticulous and strictly control the source of goods.
So-so product, not what I expected
advantage:
1. Big brand, cheap price.
Advantage 2: The motor and blades are both guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are OK to use, but there is a gap between what I expected.
shortcoming:
1. There is no indicator light when charging. They even omitted the most basic power indicator. I guess Panasonic sees customers who buy products worth 300 yuan as being given alms and shown no respect.
2. There is a strong odor when charging. Even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.
I tried it in the office for one day and the whole room was filled with this plastic smell.
Compared with the Philips PHILIPS of the same price that I used before, although it has an extra cutter head, the quality of this Panasonic product is really disappointing to consumers.
Small Package
When I received the express delivery and saw the e-commerce version written on it, I knew I had fallen into a trap again. It is much smaller than the one I bought in the supermarket, should be M. The packaging is different from the picture in the product introduction, so it must be the so-called new version.
The three stars are because I blame myself for being careless and not reading the product specifications carefully. I have no objection to you selling the M-size e-commerce version, but what does it mean that you are selling the wrong product?
E-commerce has many tricks, so I’d rather go to the supermarket to buy things when I have time.
That&#39;s it.
Don&#39;t like the taste
The child really doesn&#39;t like the taste of toothpaste and always says it&#39;s spicy. Maybe another word would be more appropriate to describe it. This is the only word in the child&#39;s vocabulary for now.
I bought it during a promotion, it was very cheap, so I feel embarrassed to give a bad review, I&#39;ll give it 4 stars, but I won&#39;t buy it again.
Genuine product, good packaging
The packaging is complete, with an air bag inside, and there are no online reviews, just the bare product.
There is a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, just as described in the picture. The delivery was also very fast, and it arrived the next day after I took the photo.
It is a genuine product, but it is out of stock. I don’t know when it will be available again.
A terrible shopping experience
I placed an order during Black Friday, but I didn&#39;t receive it after waiting for a long time. When I checked later, the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues and they all said that they didn&#39;t sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said that only the sender could initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. Finally, I figured out that the courier was mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of transactions, I finally got the courier back. The outer packaging had been opened, but the product was intact. I don&#39;t know if it had been used. In short, it was very frustrating.
Wrong picture
I thought I would receive the earphones like the one in Picture 1, but I unexpectedly received the earphones like the one in Picture 2. It’s okay if the picture and the object are inconsistent, but what does it mean that the volume of the sound on the left and right earphones is different?
Although the names are the same, I still hope that everyone can be careful and pay attention. I also ask the Amazon person in charge to replace the correct pictures in time. Thank you very much.
Operating system is average
After using it for a while, the picture quality is generally okay and I can&#39;t feel any difference. It&#39;s just that the system is confusing to look at. The boot time is obviously a bit slow, and it&#39;s impossible to set up well. There&#39;s no need to comment on the software that comes with it. The response speed is even more average, and it&#39;s not on the same order of magnitude as that of my colleague&#39;s.
I saw comments saying that it is a very user-friendly design, but I didn&#39;t find it user-friendly at all. The placement of the commonly used up, down, left, right and return buttons on the remote control is really not good.
So, just use it as a TV, and add a TV box or something like that.
The price reduction is too great
The price reduction is huge, it was over 100 yuan now 99!
There are a lot of unevaluated orders accumulated on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the evaluation content.
If I use this paragraph to evaluate, it means that this product is at least 85 points.
As for inferior products, I will never be so lazy as to copy and paste the reviews, so that other consumers can use them as a reference when purchasing, and the merchants will also improve the quality of their products.
Good quality cable at a low price, this is enough if you are not into audiophiles!
It’s such a cheap cable, but it should meet the HDMI certification standards. I personally compared it with the domestic Akihabara ones and it’s much better than those crappy things (they are twice as expensive). The cable is thick and relatively soft, and there is no noise during the 7-meter transmission. From now on, I will buy low-priced cables from Baseus!
The product is OK, but Amazon&#39;s after-sales service is much worse than other websites.
After placing an order, I found that I had made a mistake, but I couldn’t cancel the order. The webpage to contact the online customer service kept showing an error link and I couldn’t get in touch with them.
After the goods arrived, the delivery guy called me, and I said I didn&#39;t want it anymore and wanted to cancel the order but failed. The delivery guy took it back and asked me to sign for it first and apply for a return.
When applying for a return, I was told that food items cannot be returned once signed for. I couldn&#39;t call Amazon customer service, but they said the same thing: food items cannot be returned once signed for.
I have bought items that are not returnable according to policy on JD.com and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc., but I got a refund after contacting customer service. Moreover, the diapers on JD.com had a too strong smell after opening them, so I contacted customer service and got a refund anyway. But this is not possible on Amazon.
Rules are dead, but people are alive. How do you contact your customer service?
He told me that I could either accept it myself or let the delivery person buy it himself. It’s already not easy for the delivery person, so why should I ask him to pay for something that I didn’t buy myself?
OK, I won&#39;t return it, I&#39;ll keep it myself, but I have to give you 1 point for your service
Advise everyone not to waste money
First of all, I was expecting to buy it, thinking that Dole brand should not be too bad. After receiving it and looking at the packaging, I thought it was okay, and the size was not bad, but one box was basically soft, which you can&#39;t tell from the appearance. You have to feel it, and it has no taste at all in your mouth, bland and tasteless. When you bite it open, the flesh is dark yellow, which means it&#39;s rotten. Good and bad fruits are sold together, and less than one-third of them are edible. I advise everyone not to buy it. It&#39;s not cheap, and the quality is too bad!
I’ve learned a lesson from my failure and will never buy fruit from an e-commerce platform again!
Where is the product anti-counterfeiting mark
One corner of the bottom of the bottle is badly dented, probably caused by a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging bag, the degree of damage is distressing. After all, the packaging of food is too simple, and it is purchased internationally. There are no obvious anti-counterfeiting marks. It is very easy to open the bottle. The key is that a layer of honey in the lid comes out directly from the inside, and there is almost no stickiness after the opening. Are all foreign products like this?
As a person born in China, I don’t quite understand it.
It should be authentic, right?
Also, when I took the photo, it said it would arrive on the 20th, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, so I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is normal?
Pickup service needs to be improved
I bought a total of 5 pick-up coupons. When I went to pick them up, I made the first appointment to pick up 3, but only 2 were sent to me. After much communication, I confirmed that they were missed and that they needed to be resent after agreement. The second appointment happened to fall on a holiday, and neither the website nor WeChat indicated that I needed to make an appointment on a weekday, which caused unnecessary panic. I suggest that this be improved in the future.
Nice shopping
Good reviews!
I still trust Amazon&#39;s own products more. It is very convenient to shop overseas now. The logistics time from abroad is only a few days longer than that from China. I have to say that Amazon&#39;s customs clearance capabilities from overseas purchases to China are still very strong, which is much faster than transshipment. So now many things are bought on Amazon&#39;s overseas shopping.
I hope the quality and price of domestic products can be better. Many things are produced in China, but they are cheaper when you buy them abroad than in China. I hope this can be improved.
Rubbish
When you see a package like this, let me ask you: Do you think it is garbage on the roadside?
A fragile plastic package was sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag. Is this responsible packaging?
I think this kind of packaging is like garbage. When I bought this product, the packaging was extremely simple, without any measures to prevent damage. It was just a simple plastic bag. After I received it, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were damaged.
If I only encounter one like this, I will accept it. If I buy several and they are all like this, I will contact Amazon customer service and they will say that I can return it, but they will pay the shipping fee in advance and then return it to me in the form of a gift card.
Let me ask you, I paid the shipping fee in cash, and you gave me a gift card. You should just tell me that I have to buy your gift card myself. I also have to mail the product to the German warehouse myself. Isn&#39;t this a torture for buying a product?
I have been asking the customer service staff whose responsibility it is to have such a problem, but they did not say a word about it. They did not even dare to take responsibility. How can such after-sales service be guaranteed? In a word: admit it! But I guess Amazon will not even give me the opportunity to publish this review, and will directly delete it!
Very good quality 5 stars, poor logistics
1. The quality is very good, it is sold out in seconds, the price is moderate, and it is great value for money.
2. Strong, sufficient materials, firm solder joints, proper surface treatment and good color.
3. Logistics is a major flaw. I placed the order on the 3rd, but it arrived on the 11th.
4. If Amazon didn’t mark the estimated delivery date as February 7, I might be satisfied.
5. However, marking the expected delivery time is equivalent to making a promise to the user. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user will feel uncomfortable.
6. If you are not sure about the commitment, please don&#39;t make it.
7. In fact, I care very much about the promises made by merchants.
8, so I gave it a low score.
The gold thread will fade
There is still an effect, but whether it is obvious depends on the individual, or it may be a psychological effect.
One thing that is not so good is the gold thread. It was designed to look good, but in fact, the gold thread will fade. Once you put it on the car and move it a few times, some gold powder will appear on your hands and the car.
Hope the product can be improved.
This square shape has no decorative effect, so don’t put gold thread on it. It will be troublesome if it falls on the car and dirty it.
The item is in good condition, the speed is good, it is divided into 2 packages and not packed in the same way
The delivery time of 8 days is quite fast, but 2 items were divided into 2 packages with different packaging. One was obviously more shockproof, with thick cardboard pasted on it and a layer of plastic sealed, and the outer packaging was also easy to open. The other one was just like a domestic express box, with a few cushioning airbags in it. It felt a bit perfunctory.
Airland mattress is really good
The 34CM mattress is extremely thick, you can sleep on it even if you don’t need a bed.
The quality is very good, both the front and the back are very soft, very comfortable to sleep on, and I fell asleep quickly after lying on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were some stains in two places due to rough transportation by the courier. Airland customer service was very responsible and contacted us efficiently to solve the problem.
This is not a self-operated product. Amazon is shameless.
The page clearly states that the product is self-operated, but it is actually delivered by the supplier, who is also the responsible party for after-sales service. If any problems arise, please contact the supplier yourself.
If you want to cancel an order, I&#39;m sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier and cannot be canceled; if you want to return or exchange goods, and have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, I&#39;m sorry, no one will pay attention to you and you need to contact the supplier to return the goods yourself.
What the hell is this self-operated product?
The goods are not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon is not responsible for after-sales service. However, the customer service said, &quot;I will help you contact the supplier&quot; and claimed that it is self-operated. It is so shameless and blatantly shameless, and it is a naked fraud on consumers!
Depressing experience
The filter element I bought online from another store had a good filtering effect. After the 28 days were up, I used it for another day or two and there was still no scale.
Since the quality of the things I bought from Amazon has always been good, I decided to buy from here this time. It was my first time buying a filter from Amazon, and I didn’t feel very good. Not only did it start to have scale early on, but the filter also had small black carbon powder suspended in it until the 28th day of use. I really didn’t know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. I was very depressed~
Not as good as expected
Compared with the power strips I used before, the external workmanship is average. I haven&#39;t opened it to see how the inside is. I hope it is as described by the store. From the convenience of use, there is no display to show whether each independent unit is powered on.
The packaging is damaged, wait for time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is seriously damaged. The inner packaging box seems to be new, but the instruction manual does not seem to be new. The decoration was only in September and I am stocking up. I hope it will not be bad by then. Please explain to Amazon why several customers mentioned that the packaging was damaged, but you can deal with it calmly. Thank you!
Overall good, some minor issues
This is my first time buying a water filter kettle. After reading several review articles, I felt that LAICA had a better price-performance ratio, so I chose this one. After receiving the product, I installed the filter element according to the instructions and tried it. I felt it was generally good, but when pouring water, it seemed that the raw water would mix with the treated water at the spout (the raw water tank was not sealed tightly).
When using, be sure to wait until all the water is filtered before pouring it out!
Incomplete picture
The picture does not capture the details of the side, and the details on the side are inconsistent with the style of the main body, there is a big difference, this is the first point; this bead is made in Thailand, and the place of origin is not indicated, this is the second point; the texture is not indicated, this is the third point; when I bought it in the UK, each item clearly had a box, but here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product logo on the beads, how can I tell whether it is real or fake.
Be careful when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service sucks
I placed an order two days ago, and when I received the product today I found the price had dropped by 40 RMB. I spent a lot of time looking for customer service, but they said they couldn&#39;t make up the price difference, but I could buy it again and return it.
This kind of customer experience and service is ten thousand times worse than Taobao and JD.
It&#39;s OK. As a beginner, it&#39;s worth buying.
The quality is acceptable, and it cannot be compared with the top-quality King Kong. I have seen the price in the mall before, and it is at least several hundred yuan. It is my first time to play with King Kong, and it is okay.
Good stuff
The item is really good. I gave it to my girlfriend. However, I was not in Canada at noon and there was some unpleasantness when I picked up the courier. The logistics company directly put it in the mail storage and did not send me a verification SMS for picking up the item, so I had to make two trips.
But the baby is really good.
Worth buying
The little monkey is cute, Amazon has really great discounts, and it is shipped directly from Chow Sang Sang’s official website. I placed the order the night before yesterday and received it this afternoon, which is really fast.
The postal couriers are also very responsible.
praise!
A customer&#39;s confession
1 When you receive such defective products, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then you contact the customer service staff, they will tell you that this issue will be handled by a specialist and he will inform you of the result.
You can never actively contact this specialist, you don’t know her work number, and there is no direct contact number. In other words, you cannot contact her, only she can contact you.
3The tragedy is that after waiting for nearly 3 days, the specialist contacted me, but my phone was off for a while and I didn’t receive a call from the specialist.
I waited for 2 hours but didn&#39;t get a call from the specialist. During this time, I took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service and sent an email to ask them to call me back.
4 Nearly 3 days have passed and I still don’t know how Amazon will deal with this defective coffee machine I received!
5. There is nothing wrong with the products on Amazon in the United States. Overseas shopping is a good way of shopping, but the service is far worse than that of Amazon.
6 For me, I can only keep waiting...
Uneven bottom
I had high expectations for this pot because the reviews said it was good. I liked it very much when I got it, and it was very lightweight. But I discovered the problem when I opened the pot. The bottom of the pot is not flat. It is bulging in the middle and concave around the edges, so the oil has all gone to the edges. I bought it specially to open the pot with a large piece of fatty meat, but the oil didn&#39;t cover the central area, so it was burnt and I couldn&#39;t even open the pot. I guess it&#39;s not suitable for cooking properly with such a structure.
I don’t know if I was unlucky, but I happened to get a pot with an uneven base. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I returned it without hesitation.
I scrubbed the pot clean and went back, feeling that all my work was in vain.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing technology to achieve
This is a product with a very simple design style.
The shape of the cube is such that the designer made the top slightly curved.
It should have been a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.
Because there are two parts on the top, the control panel in the front and the water box cover in the back.
The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel are actually inconsistent, and after they are put together, there is a height difference of up to about 2mm.
Although it looks like a very small gap.
But it can be said that the entire sense of design has been destroyed.
I feel a little sorry for that product designer.
It seems that Midea’s product managers are not yet capable of creating products of this quality.
(Of course, we cannot expect too much feedback from the after-sales lady, but when I heard the after-sales staff say that all units of this product are like this, and it is not just the one I bought that has problems, her indifference and honesty made me understand that I cannot expect too much from beauty.) 2019-7-7 The water pump failed and the water output was low. This was the second repair. It broke down again two weeks after the first repair.
It’s a good deal after the discount, but Amazon’s fake discounts make me sad
Bought it one week after my baby was born, it has superb thermal insulation.
There is no trace of heat on the outside of the pot, which means you don&#39;t have to worry about getting burned and the temperature can be effectively prevented from dissipating.
After a night, the air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon said that there would be big discounts during its anniversary event, but later I found out that they were all priced at 249, 289, and 299. I felt cheated for a moment, but after comparing them at the supermarket, I still found that they were much better than various unknown brands at the same price. I can carry them in my car when I go out in the future.
Vitamix Vitamix 6300
I have been watching for a long time, and when I saw that it was discounted to 6300 on Amazon and the same price on overseas shopping in Central Asia, I acted quickly.
I placed the order on September 2nd, and the estimated arrival date was the 21st. However, it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days early. It was really fast!
The packaging box is not big, and it uses the original packaging of Vitamix, so Amazon doesn’t have to worry about it getting damaged after shipping across the ocean!
The machine looks quite new and has all the accessories, but the cup on the base shakes violently. I am afraid that the cup will fly out when I turn it on!
I asked a friend who has 5200, and from his description it seems that mine is not as loose.
The recipe that comes with the machine is all in English, which is quite tiring to read. I also can’t find a Chinese version online, which is a hassle!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer. It will probably arrive in 3 days. I will tinker with it then!
Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.
Not a large size at all!
The second Totes, 1. It has no umbrella cover 2. The material of the handle is average 3. It clearly says Large, but it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person, and it is probably not enough for two people to use.
On the contrary, the one I bought from Amazon can be used by three people without any pressure.
Not feeling good
First of all, the box is not very sturdy and it gets deformed when pressed. Secondly, the design of the back is not effective in preventing the ABS surface from being scratched when the box is laid flat. Thirdly, the inside of the box is just wrapped in a piece of cloth, and the pull rod is protruding... etc. I was dissatisfied with various things, and finally the zipper was a bit not smooth.
PS: The wheels feel really good
Well enough
Pros: This backpack is relatively refined and looks durable.
Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what the hell), a 15.6-inch laptop cannot be put in (can it be a little longer), the zipper of this backpack can be locked, but there is no lock for the buyer, which is not service-oriented.
Overall it&#39;s OK, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s real leather
The overall feeling is okay, but I don’t know whether it is real leather, so I can’t make a blind comment.
It can hold A4 format documents and over 80 pages thick, but it probably can&#39;t hold box-shaped objects that are too thick and hard (non-deformable).
The bag is very soft, and the inner pockets are divided in a user-friendly way, which is pretty good.
But the one I got has a small sand hole on the bottom. I don’t know if it’s because I have bad luck or not?
I&#39;m too lazy to go back and forth to exchange the goods, so I just put up with it.
Overall, it&#39;s worth a four-star rating.
ForRoyal popular camera strap SLR strap
This strap is designed scientifically. It is practical to hang on both shoulders. The chest part uses soft material to fix and protect the camera. Unlike other quick shooters, it does not use screws to fix the bottom and damage the camera. It is also very convenient to take it off for taking pictures.
Garbage after-sales
I bought a guitar a month and a half ago and it was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me the after-sales phone number. After many communications, I still haven&#39;t received the part. How can this be considered inefficient?
I guess it will be more troublesome to repair if there are any problems in the future. Friends who are expecting good after-sales service should just avoid it, it’s too troublesome!
Minor flaws, good sound
The headstock has a defect, with a corner missing, and it feels like a defective product, and there are no gifts, but the price is already good, and the tone of the guitar is also good.
Okay, the first batch of orders
I&#39;ve been using it for a long time, and except for the lack of bass, it&#39;s generally good.
The workmanship is not as perfect as imagined.
When I first bought it, there was something wrong with it, all the lights were blinking and it wouldn&#39;t work.
I requested a replacement, but the goods have been delivered to Shanghai for three days and still haven&#39;t been delivered.
Called the delivery guy but no one answered.
The courier company said that was the only contact information they had.
Amazon can&#39;t find a place to complain.
I didn&#39;t ask for delayed delivery, but for no apparent reason they delayed the delivery as per my request - a text message like this came to me.
Then there is the issue of transit.
Anyway, it was a very bad shopping experience and I began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon&#39;s logistics and control systems.
I guess I won’t get it today.
The label is not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof and there is no coating on the surface. The label has poor adhesion and is not suitable for cable labels. It is very easy to fall off. Friends who buy it for cable organization need to pay attention.
The pen is OK, but the packaging is too simple, just a paper box without any protective measures. Moreover, the box for the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent tape, and when you tear it off, the tape is all on the box.
This is how I treated a 600 yuan item. It was a very disappointing shopping experience.
The pen is fine though.
I hope there will be more improvements in packaging in the future!
The quality is excellent, but in terms of writing, it is not as good as 925-25
First of all, I would like to give a thumbs up to Tiantian Express. The air delivery is super fast and the service attitude is also very good!
I have been using 925-25, which is great. I just received 925-85. The quality of the pen is excellent and the style is very beautiful. The reason I gave it four stars is that the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing. The pen cap shakes a bit when adjusting the lead length. My personal opinion: 925-25 is more convenient than 85.
So I became a die-hard fan of Amazon
I bought it at a super good price, but my child didn&#39;t like the reading pen.
It has been opened. I tried to apply for a return and they actually came to pick it up for free.
So cool.
Returns are not encouraged, but this service is the only one of its kind in China.
Hope it won&#39;t be abused.
I will buy all my future books here.
The earphones have a biased sound and there is noise
This headset is really garbage. I don&#39;t know if there is something wrong with my ears or if this headset is really not as good as it used to be.
I bought a blue one on an e-commerce website two years ago. The sound quality was pretty good, with no noise and good bass. After using it for more than two years, it broke and I planned to buy another one (urbeats). After all, it feels pretty good.
I also saw a purple one that looked pretty good, but when I bought this one and opened it today, I felt something was wrong. One side had a loud sound while the other side had a soft sound.
At first I thought it was because of the sound effects of that song and didn&#39;t think much about it, but after listening for a long time I found that this problem was very serious. Not only was the sound biased, but the bass effect was not as good as my previous one, and there was also some noise. Is this only the purple one I bought? Or is the current headphone manufacturing process really not good enough?
Pretty bad review, very disappointed.
Must return the goods tomorrow during the day.
PS Good appearance
This AV amplifier has a complicated setup, rough workmanship, and generates a lot of heat.
The sound will be evaluated after using it for a while!
I just bought the German version of DN1080 on August 14th. At first glance, the workmanship is very poor.
1. The front panel and knobs are made of plastic.
2. The audio input jack and speaker output terminal on the back panel are very poor. You can find a CD amplifier that costs 1000-2000 which is much better than this one.
3. The top cover is relatively thin, and my transformer was dented on that side. I had to open the box and fix it manually. The top cover and the front panel were loosely connected.
4. The center of gravity of the entire machine is biased towards the transformer end, which makes it awkward to move.
It feels like an entry-level Sony machine, judging by the workmanship, and it’s made in Malaysia.
I feel that it would be much better for Sony to outsource its products to China than to Xiaoma.
5. The machine generates a lot of heat. When I watched a movie with two channels for about 2 hours, the top cover was 40-50℃ when I touched it with my hand. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, switching power supplies are mostly used. This huge transformer is estimated to weigh 4KG.
Sony should use silent fans for active cooling in the machine. After unboxing, all I saw were large aluminum heat sinks on the tubes.

Never opened
The battery is in use.
I really want to dissect it and see what&#39;s inside its stomach.
Later I thought, if I am disappointed after unpacking it, it would be a waste of money; if I am satisfied after unpacking it, it would be difficult to put it back together and I would not be happy using it.
Forget it, even if Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed description of battery power, most people would feel uneasy when reading it.
I&#39;m fine. I have worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not understanding circuits, I am also half a battery engineer, so I can handle it.
Overjoyed
I was really unsure before I bought it, until I opened it and saw the packaging, I felt it was very genuine!
Finally, when I touched the headphone cable, I felt it was very flexible and of such good quality that I couldn’t wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was shocked to find that the sound quality was actually surround 3D!
I asked in a physical communication store, and it&#39;s about 30 yuan. However, it is definitely not a PISEN brand, but a miscellaneous brand. So although this PISEN is 27 yuan, it is definitely worth having because of its cost-effectiveness!
Worst online shopping experience
After placing the order on September 28, the system showed that the goods had been shipped, but I waited until October 12 and still hadn&#39;t received the goods.
When checking the status of an Amazon order, the seller did not provide the tracking number, so I couldn&#39;t find where the order was.
So I sent an email to the seller asking if he could provide the courier tracking number, but there was no reply after two days.
In desperation, I called Amazon customer service, and they told me the seller&#39;s mobile phone number. I called the store again, and after calling several times, the call finally went through. I was told that the courier had lost the package and they could send me another one immediately.
Although I was very angry, I needed the computer urgently, so I didn&#39;t say much to the seller. I just wanted it to be sent to me immediately.
As a result, I called the next day to ask if the goods had been shipped.
The seller said it hasn’t been delivered yet and it will be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon and the seller said that it would definitely be shipped after 5 or 6 p.m. However, when I called at 7 p.m., no one answered the phone.
I called again on the morning of the third day and asked if the goods had been shipped.
Could you tell me the order number?
The seller said it hadn’t been shipped yet, and told me that if I was in a hurry, I could order from another store, and if I could wait, it would be shipped in the afternoon.
There is no other way. If I place an order from another store, I will have to wait a long time.
We can only ask the seller to ship the goods quickly.
Finally, after countless phone tracking, I received the computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don’t know because I bought it for someone else. I will add a comment later.
I just bought it half a year ago and haven&#39;t used it many times. Now the contact is bad. Can you repair it?
Because I have a desktop computer, I haven&#39;t used it very often since I bought it.
I just carry it in my bag when I&#39;m on a business trip and use it a few times.
Recently I discovered that when it is plugged in, it does not charge, and I need to use my hands to hold the connection between the charger and the cable left and right a few times before it can charge.
I suspect there is poor contact at the interface. I wonder if it can be repaired now?
It is strongly recommended that Amazon stop using EMS!
The product is five stars, the logistics is one star, and the average is three stars.
I don’t understand why Amazon uses EMS to send packages. It is generally recognized in the industry as unreliable. After all, computers are valuable items!
After purchasing, the order showed that it was expected to be delivered on the 20th, so my family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four or five days to send from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
I checked the logistics on the morning of the 22nd and found that the package had finally arrived in Fuzhou. I was ready to receive the goods happily. However, in the evening, without receiving any calls or text messages, I checked the logistics and found that it had been signed for at noon. It also showed that I had signed for it!
I was shocked instantly!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I&#39;m really questioning my life!
Finally, I went to the collection point to get the computer back.
To put it simply, the specific reason is that the courier mixed up the two order numbers, but fortunately the package was not lost.
I strongly suggest that Amazon stop using EMS. If Amazon uses EMS to deliver express packages in the future, I will definitely not buy from them again.
The goods are pretty good
First of all, I bought it for just a few days and then I found out that the price had dropped, so I give a bad review. This laptop is pretty good, with high cost performance. The CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and quite a few large stand-alone games, the heat dissipation is very good, but the screen has some light leakage (a common problem of IPS screens), the audio quality is not very good, the hard drive is not good (I suggest you spend some money to add a solid state drive). I took it to after-sales service to check the hardware yesterday, and there was no problem. The built-in win8.1 is not very easy to use, and I suggest you upgrade to 10. The seller shipped the computer quickly and answered all my inquiries quickly. The invoice arrived the next day after I received the computer. It&#39;s good, but it&#39;s a pity that there are no gifts.
(By the way, when buying keyboard films, be sure not to go to a store called E-Cool Digital Center on Taobao. The delivery is slow and the quality is poor. If there are any problems with the products, they will not be returned or exchanged. The boss is also full of swear words. I would like to expose them here.)
The product is good, but the platform bureaucracy remains
The hard drive is of very good quality and has an absolutely high cost-performance ratio. It is even cheaper than buying it in Hong Kong. I definitely recommend buying it if you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics.
But I have to say that the Amazon platform is still as bureaucratic as ever. There has been no improvement since a few years ago when I swore I would never use it. You can never check the actual logistics status, the information will always be delivered several weeks later, and you can never complain. It is so bureaucratic!
It has been a few days since I received the goods, and the logistics information is that you will receive the goods in more than 10 days!
Logistics is not worry-free
It was delivered in this state. Not only was the packaging crushed, but the electrical appliance packaging was also opened. I don&#39;t know if it was swapped.
FYI
I haven&#39;t tried it yet, but I always trust Philips and hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
I checked online and it may be a common problem of water ingress, and there is no warranty.
depressed!
Now wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it. I wonder how long it can last?
Bought something that someone else had opened
It is indeed quite high to charge more than one hundred yuan in tax for a machine that costs more than three hundred yuan. Now I feel much more balanced when I see it costs more than six hundred yuan.
When I received it, the sealing strip looked wrong, as if it had been opened. I quickly took a picture, and sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. After opening it, the cardboard inside was damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I quickly gave it to my husband to try before our anniversary. As a result, the machine had no power at all. Fortunately, there was no stubble inside the blade, otherwise how could I return it from such a long distance!
It is still unknown whether it is easy to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term. As the previous reviews show, things sent out when out of stock are indeed unreliable!
Experience is above average
It’s almost a top-level electric brush, with many modes for cleaning teeth, but few people would switch to different modes every day.
I have used it for half a year without any problems. I flush it every day and about once a week.
Brush head accessories are also cheap to buy on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use. Apart from changing the colors, other compatibility issues seem to be caused by the overseas version?
I hope to learn Dafa.
Very cost-effective
Have used it 3-4 times already.
1. The packaging is intact.
2. It is very easy to use and clean.
3. You can DIY your haircut and save money.
All in all, it was a very successful purchase.
There are fakes
Last time I bought two packs, and they turned out to be two different versions. The words on the lower left corner of the packaging were originally green, but one pack had white words instead. As a result, my cat had diarrhea after eating it.
I’m not sure whether the goods from Amazon are fake or they were swapped by employees during delivery.
I will buy it again, and if it is still a fake, I will hold you responsible persons accountable.
It&#39;s a horizontal bar!
The Amazon picture has a slash, but the one sent to me has a horizontal bar. Isn&#39;t this cheating?
The effect is OK
Cats like to eat, that’s the point.
It does work.
Tight and narrow, it binds the feet and rubs the instep.
Not recommended.
1. UN is the most comfortable series of Clarks, but this one is so bad.
Additional: Today I compared the previous UN series insoles (I kept the insoles after throwing away the shoes), and found that the material is much worse than before. The elasticity and breathability are not as good as before. They are just fake and soft.
2. My instep is not very high, and the painful area is about 3 centimeters forward from the highest point of the instep.
3. I bought three pairs of Clarks overseas, but only one pair fit.
I was so scared that I deleted all the Qile in my favorites.
I&#39;ll try Rockport later. If that doesn&#39;t work I&#39;ll have to go to the physical Ecco store.
Substandard products, poor quality control
First of all, it is worth affirming that Prime International Shopping is very powerful. The order placed on the 31st was received on the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than in the pictures, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is a little bit bigger, the size is 7.5W for a 25 foot length and 10.5 width. It is a little loose on the foot, but I usually like to wear loose clothes, so a pair of insoles is just right.
Secondly, the quality control of this pair of shoes is really poor. The glue on the sole of one shoe is damaged, and the upper of the other shoe has various scratches and a pinhole. The rubber strip at the connection between the upper and the sole is misplaced. It is obvious that they are inferior products!
A little regretful!
I bought it during a promotion for 280 yuan. It&#39;s a good price to buy Asics. Of course, there are lower prices according to the reviews.
Now let’s talk about the shoes. Pros: The shoes are very light, very comfortable for running, and they fit well without being baggy.
It looks great but has obvious flaws: I usually wear size 40 shoes, but this time I bought size 40.5. When I put the shoes in, there is still about a thumb&#39;s length of space at the front, but it doesn&#39;t affect anything.
This shoe is very &quot;narrow&quot;. Although there is still some space in the front, it feels tight.
Another thing is that the shoes may not be very breathable. My feet feel very hot when I wear them now.
Instep pressure
First of all, the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are very standard. I have bought several pairs of running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, and ECCO from Amazon, and they have never been ill-fitting. However, I referred to the reviews and bought a size up uk7 for this pair. After putting them on, the length was obviously longer because of the size increase. However, the insole was too thick and it still pressed the instep severely. In addition, the hiking shoes were very hard, which made it very uncomfortable to put on.
If your feet are not particularly thin, I don&#39;t recommend buying this.
If you really have to buy one, you can solve the problem by replacing the insole, but the original insole looks very high-end, it would be a pity not to use it.
A perfect shopping!
I am very satisfied and like it very much. All products purchased overseas on Amazon are authentic without a doubt, and the quality is also very good, with good quality and low price. You can buy with confidence. The after-sales service is very thoughtful, and the customer service attitude is very friendly and kind. They handle problems patiently and efficiently, and perfectly solve all worries. The supporting express delivery to the door is very convenient and safe. The delivery master is very considerate of the customers and always reminds them to pick up the goods from the express cabinet in time. Thank you Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In short, our whole family loves shopping on Amazon!
Absolutely bad review!
I am really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
Although it has been a long time, I still want to complain.
I bought it during a flash sale in winter for less than 200 yuan, and left it at home for several months without using it.
When I wanted to use it in the spring, I found that it couldn&#39;t connect to the bracelet. The manuals of both devices stated that they supported each other. Later I found that it should be a problem with the heart rate belt, because I tried other devices but it still couldn&#39;t connect.
I called Amazon and they asked me to contact the agency, and the agency asked me to send the device to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
Nearly half a month later, the item was sent back intact, even the express box was the one I used to send it!
There is no reply, receipt or test report!
Please tell me at least whether it is good or bad!
I called to ask, and they said that sending it back like this means there is no problem with the device and it is in good condition.
But why can’t I connect? The agency replied: That’s not their business.
It&#39;s my bad luck. I don&#39;t want to be bothered by you for a 200 yuan thing.
Seriously mismatched goods.
The product is totally different from the one advertised.
The headband material is very good.
Much better than Nike.
The breathability is also very good.
Just the cap in front.
Very thin.
Are you here to tease me?!
There is no sunlight at all.
No returns because it functions well as a headband.
Wearing it upwards won&#39;t block the sun.
But it is different from other headband styles.
Keep it for later use.
The product quality is good, Amazon lacks a contractual spirit, and the delivery person is very good.
I request delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon does not allow delivery on Saturdays or Sundays.
I had to drive 200 kilometers from another place to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery guy was very positive and enthusiastic.
Give a like!
The product was simply tried and it was pretty good.
But I have never bought similar products before, so I can’t compare prices!
Size Logistics
The workmanship is OK, but the logistics is too slow. In the past, all the shoes were shipped by DHL, but this time Apex is really... I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the prices are not low. I feel that they are of higher grade than NIKE ADIDAS?
In fact, they are all the same, so buy overseas.
Size: I am 176cm tall and 68kg. I have broad shoulders and usually wear 180cm size clothes. I bought M size. The hem is a little long, but the rest fits me perfectly. I saw someone recommended S size. Are you so slim? Or do you like tight fit? I think hoodies are better with loose fit.
Perfect size
My chest measurement is 99, my height is 184, and my weight is 84 kg. Before purchasing, I consulted the customer service and was told that I should buy the xxl size. Then I read the reviews and decisively bought the L size. After receiving the goods, I found that the size was just right. I almost got cheated.
The prices on Double Eleven are much higher than those on Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The problem of the most affordable product is very troublesome!
I placed the order on the 18th, but received the goods on the 25th. The journey from Guangzhou to Beijing is as slow as a snail!
I bought the most affordable product. The description said there were scratches, but after receiving the product, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The child was reluctant to return the product, thinking it was not a big problem. However, the accessory was a small part that the child’s grandfather couldn’t find after going to several nearby hardware stores!
It was my grandpa who glued it on in the end!
It seems that I can’t buy the most affordable products in the future!
Poor toy processing quality
Most of the bolt holes were not aligned, and it was very difficult to bolt them in, which showed that the processing quality was poor. I also didn&#39;t know how long I could play with it, but since it was something I promised to my child, I decided not to return it.
Other reviews said that installation was easy, is it the only one I bought that has problems?
Very general
Am I just unlucky?
The packaging is extremely old; the workmanship is very average; there is only one type of music and it is only 8 seconds long and it repeats over and over again; the movements are just shaking your head and walking forward, without any changes.
Not worth the price.
If you need it urgently, you won’t return it.
The toy is of good quality, but I have to complain about the packaging
I received a package yesterday. I bought it from Amazon. It was marked as delivered by EMS, but it was finally delivered by Tmall. How many twists and turns did it take? Do Amazon and Tmall have a good relationship?
Let me talk about the packaging. It was wrapped in several layers of plastic wrap without even a plastic bubble wrap. When I opened it, I saw all the parts were just in an empty box. Fortunately, the toy is of good quality with no broken parts. It&#39;s just much smaller than I expected. Because it doesn&#39;t have a battery, it often derails when pushed by hand. It feels like the gaps on both sides of the track are too large and the design is unreasonable.
Good quality, fun
It’s fun, the components are of high precision, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is almost the same as Lego, and the price is very favorable during promotions.
The assembly process is quite interesting. I assemble it and my 5-year-old son plays with it. It&#39;s great.
He had a lot of fun playing with it. He will probably continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
The machine is new, good for overseas shopping
I looked at it during Christmas. It was 150 yuan more expensive than what I bought before, but the delivery is a bit slow now.
The machine is still good, all quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then if you connect to the Poké Ball, you will get a Mew.
It&#39;s pretty good to play, and it&#39;s more portable than PS4.
I&#39;ve already bought Zelda, and I&#39;m waiting for the game to come out, so I&#39;ll give it a try.
They produce crappy products, sell crappy products, and provide crappy service. I bought six watches for my children, but one of them did not display complete numbers. The time on all six watches was inconsistent, with a difference of more than ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer and asked if they checked the time of the watches before they were put into storage. They replied &quot;yes&quot;. If so, then why is there such a big difference in time? It must be because the watches are not accurate. Simply put, they are parallel imported products. I&#39;m not saying this to sound bad, but look, they have obvious quality problems (incomplete digital display) and they are still being sold. Aren&#39;t they junk?
I contacted the seller, and he gave me a lot of reasons, and also complained that I shouldn&#39;t have bought their products in the first place. With such products, such sellers, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future?
In short, I suggest not to buy anything from this seller, because it will be junk if you buy it.
Amazon delivery issues
After receiving the goods, I checked and found:
1. The watch packaging is seriously worn out.
2. The instruction manual has serious wrinkles.
3. The watch does not work, the desk lamp cannot be used even if it is charged, and the time cannot be adjusted.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately. You can only ship to the United States at your own expense and pay the postage later.
5. The reason for the 2 points is that the customer service is pretty good.
I can only say it&#39;s okay
The time is not very accurate, about one second faster or slower every day, and after just a few months of use it is already almost two minutes faster.
I used a Citizen watch before, and it felt like it wouldn&#39;t be off by a few seconds even after a year or two.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, but the chronograph function is a bit useless and is basically not used. Occasionally, I will accidentally enter the chronograph mode.
Solar Sports Watches
Advantages: Solar charging means no need to worry about replacing batteries, world time, multiple alarms and hourly reminders.
Disadvantages: The mirror surface is easily scratched and dusty.
Cost-effectiveness: The general price in China is between 220-300, and it costs more than 180 when purchased overseas (it takes about 1 week).
Very satisfied with the watch
It is definitely authentic. I went to the counter to check the goods. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, and the materials are sufficient. In addition, it has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It is incomparable to those so-called mechanical watches that cost three or four hundred yuan. This watch is genuine and authentic.
The watch is very accurate, and the error is completely within the acceptable range. There is a jewelry appraisal certificate in the packaging of the watch. The number 12 on the dial is a real diamond. This is very suitable for yourself to wear, and it is also very face-saving to give it as a gift.
Bentley watches are really good.
Worst shopping experience ever
On the evening of September 23, my wife&#39;s phone fell, so I immediately went to Amazon to order an 8p on a whim. The product was available but it was not a self-operated store and there was no price increase (I was secretly happy). Since it was not a self-operated store, the delivery was slower and the system showed that the estimated date of receipt was September 27 at the latest.
My wife was so upset without a mobile phone that she asked me to think of a solution at around 6 a.m. the next day. Later, I went to JD.com and saw that 256G phones were available and could be delivered the same day, so I had to order another one immediately.
After buying the new one, I thought about canceling the Amazon order immediately.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible for me to receive the courier in the early morning. I called customer service at around 7 o&#39;clock to request to cancel the order. Customer service replied that it had been cancelled and I should wait for SMS notification.
Well, I waited patiently. At noon, I checked my phone and found that the order was still in the status and had not been shipped. I immediately contacted customer service to cancel the order. The customer service replied that the operation had been completed.
At 3 pm, I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again and clearly inform them that this was the third call. Please cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship the goods!
At my request, the customer service contacted the seller on the spot and told me that the seller was not familiar with the system and had to wait until he became familiar with the system before canceling the order.
But I was told clearly that the seller already knew about it and would definitely not ship the product, so please rest assured.
When I looked at the order again on Monday, I found that it had already been shipped. I was speechless.
Since I couldn’t contact the seller directly, I had to call customer service again.
The subsequent handling was simply speechless. Basically, I said a step and the customer service would then proceed with the operation.
The order is still in the delivery rejection status and is being prepared for delivery again!
Won’t Amazon take the initiative to follow up?
It doesn’t matter if the selling company doesn’t follow up since they have already received the money.
To sum up, I will never prepay for large items in the future. It&#39;s too troublesome.
Looks great
I had my eyes on this camera a long time ago, but did not buy it for other reasons besides the price. This time I bought it because it included free shipping and the price was reasonable.
After I bought it, there were no problems with other things, but I couldn&#39;t connect to the software. My home router is TP. After checking on the Internet, I found that many people had this problem. I spent more than two hours changing the router settings. Finally, I used 360WIFI as a medium to fix it. During this period, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn&#39;t have any solution to this problem, so they directly asked me to contact Amazon for after-sales.
Another point worth noting is that I saw a user&#39;s comment online saying that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and those with smaller storage capacity cannot be recognized. I hope everyone pays attention to this.
It feels okay to use, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor. The machine generates a certain degree of heat, and if it is turned on all the time, this level of heat is a bit unacceptable.
To sum up, this product still has many shortcomings, and I hope everyone will be cautious when buying it.
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I bought this for my first love. We were dating for almost 3 years, and he left me last year, and I have been with him ever since.
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I bought this with my first love in life. I don’t know to what extent it has been used now. Maybe it has been thrown away!
We were together for almost 3 years, and she left me last year. Now whenever I think of her, I feel so heartbroken that I want to leave this world. The first woman in my life brought me a lifetime of shadow and heartache, and I have not been able to get over it yet.
When I bought this phone, I thought about the feeling we had at that time, and thought that we could still share the joys and sorrows together, but now it is too painful to look back. Maybe this is what life is like. There are some people you never want to meet in your lifetime, and there are some things you never want to know in your lifetime, but what can you do?
How many times when I saw this Samsung phone, I thought of her, and that kind of pain came and filled my whole body. I have never been willing to use a phone that costs more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I did not hesitate. No matter how good you are to a person, if one day she changes her mind, all the vows you made will disappear into thin air.
High-quality domestic brands
Huawei is a top-quality domestic product.
Low-key bosses and companies rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business trend of relying on advertising to increase visibility!
An enterprise without strength simply cannot do this, nor dare to do so!
That’s why I chose Huawei.
I have been using it for more than half a year and I feel it is very good.
The reason I didn&#39;t give it full marks is that there was one time when I was using its offline navigation, it had a positioning problem and I ultimately couldn&#39;t find out the reason, but it was fine otherwise.
Moreover, it can input the destination online and automatically design the route after searching. After leaving the wifi, its automatic offline navigation function is very practical. There is no need to use data. It communicates directly with the satellite to realize positioning and navigation. It is very good!
Sony is great
This low-end machine from Sony still has a strong sense of design, is cheap, has a large screen, and has excellent battery life, making it very suitable for the elderly.
Although a long time has passed, the machine is still working fine.
But since my Z2 has been downgraded, this phone has also accomplished its mission.
