Talent is the key to rural revitalization.
Where to find talent?
Outstanding migrant workers returning to their hometowns are an indispensable new force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Turning outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, whose family is in Guoyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan, quit his job in Beijing in 2010 with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned to his hometown to start a business.
After several years of hard work, he now runs a grape planting family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, becoming a well-known leader in getting rich, and has also been selected to join the team of the "two committees" of the village.
In recent years, under the encouragement and inspiration of a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit farmers, such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their hometowns to start businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were produced, 61,000 village reserve forces were cultivated, and more than 20,000 party members were developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Whether you are well-off or not, the key depends on your fellow countrymen.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in China's rural areas have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively it has also led to the emergence of "hollowing" in rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations, and the secretaries of village party branches and party members have shown the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, they are aging and have low educational qualifications, and the team of leaders of village party organizations is not strong, and the problem of lack of young and yellow people is prominent.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing to the city in one direction, and the countryside has been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
Attracting those peasant workers who are capable, conscious, and interested in serving their hometowns back, guiding them to return to their hometowns to start businesses and become leaders in getting rich, selecting the best from them to train them to become party members and rural cadres, and enriching the ranks of grassroots cadres is the fundamental policy to solve the problem of the shortage of rural party members and grassroots party organizations.
If outstanding migrant workers can be brought back, they must be retained and do a good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has started with the party building of migrant workers, and on the basis of strict selection standards, it has established institutional mechanisms such as targeted referral, service guarantee, training and improvement, and selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their ability, work security, and hope for life, and truly take root in the countryside and have a sense of accomplishment in entrepreneurship.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty, and talent is the key factor in the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding migrant workers who have returned to their hometowns, and through comprehensive measures, build them into a task force and a new force that can be retained, can fight, and cannot be taken away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural areas to get rid of poverty and become moderately prosperous and revitalize their development.
On the evening of July 11th, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special online live performance to the graduates, and musicians such as Lao Wolf, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun, and Mao Buyi sent singing and blessings to the graduates.
The well-known up master SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a song "Weeds", which is a rap-style song adapted and created by him based on Lu Xun's prose and poetry collection of the same name, which is extremely popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic, many graduates were unable to experience the ritual of on-site tasseling and degree certificate awarding, so they transferred the sense of ceremony online.
According to the data, this 2.5-hour song party has a peak popularity of more than 35 million live broadcasts.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, and don't care about the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains. ”
Although it was a graduation song, many of the songs also touched the non-recent graduates.
"I really want to cry after watching the whole scene, everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but they are all worth remembering, and they must go on bravely. ”
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 species of wild animals to "settle" in the city - Chinanews.com

The capital's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting wildlife to "settle" in the city
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Landscaping Bureau that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the capital's natural ecological environment, the types and numbers of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500, including national first-class protected animals such as brown horse pheasant and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as impala, whooper swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Whether it is an urban forest planted in the Second Ring Road or a small wetland embedded between buildings, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the middle of summer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of life.
A raccoon dog is playing leisurely by a mountain stream, while two badgers are playing with each other.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn't resist the "stinging" on its body and was rubbing against the bark of the tree. Hu Qiaoli, director of the management office of Songshan National Nature Reserve, said that by the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there were 178 species of wild animals, including the golden eagle, a national first-class protected animal, and spoon chicken, and impala, which are national second-class protected animals, and nearly one-third of the city's wild animal species can be seen here.
"In Matsuyama, wild animals are the real 'owners', and our staff can only be regarded as people's 'bodyguards' at best. ”
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to learn about the wildlife in the reserve, more than 30 professional rangers patrol along 16 carefully formulated conservation routes every day, and there is a "big circle" every month, spending a whole day to visit almost the entire reserve.
"During the inspection, it is not only necessary to check and record the biodiversity, but also to check the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install infrared cameras in the field, and so on. ”
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the reserve in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the camera, leopard cats, raccoon dogs and badgers have become "resident guests", and the "appearance rate" of impala, a national second-class protected animal, is also getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Conservation Division of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping and Landscaping, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now, and the variety and number of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
Wildlife is becoming more and more common in cities, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of urban greening in the capital in recent years.
In particular, a new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million mu started in 2018 proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, improve the ecological function of woodland and green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
In terms of planning, it strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green space, so that wild animals can "visit relatives and friends", and the trees planted are also the nectar and food source plants that animals love.
Black soil "grows" agricultural modernization-Xinhuanet
Harbin, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Black soil "grows" agricultural modernization
In the middle of summer, two spraying planes swept past the 10,000 mu high-yield demonstration field of the second operation station of the fifth management area of the friendship farm, forming two white lines, and the big words "the first in the world" planted with black rice seedlings in the green field are particularly eye-catching.
Kong Lingqiang, head of the station, said that this kind of aircraft can spray pesticides on more than 6,000 acres of cultivated land in a day, and the efficiency is about eight times that of drones and hundreds of times that of manual labor.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, China's largest grain-producing province, from the past "swish" rice cutting sound to the current "rumbling" motor sound, Chinese traditional farming and farms in this black soil belt to achieve transformation.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in modern agricultural production at Friendship Farms.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural inputs, reduce pollution, on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardized operation of agricultural machinery in the field.
In this year's rice production process, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned rice transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes the seedlings planted more evenly, which can maximize the use of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and can also save 16 yuan per mu of labor costs.
The farm has tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, and has formed the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm machinery is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field is 99.8%.
100% of agricultural machinery operations have achieved GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dry fields, and 100% of high-horsepower locomotive operations in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the directions for agricultural modernization. ”
Liu Hualian, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role as the "aircraft carrier" of modern agriculture, and has initially established a modern agricultural industrial system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrialized operation.
On the outskirts of Youyi County, there is an Agricultural Machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 sets (pieces) of agricultural machinery and tools that have been introduced and used by Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation over the years are exhibited here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.
Giving up a small home for everyone - Anhui Hefei Jiangkou River Lianwei mass transfer direct hit-Xinhuanet
Hefei, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The transfer of the masses in Jiangkouhe, Hefei, Anhui Province, is a direct blow to the masses
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu, and Liu Xiacun
At around 4 p.m. on July 25, Fu Kunbao wore mud-covered rubber shoes, from the front room to the back room, and his wife Zhou Yan were busy packing up their things back and forth.
"After receiving a call from the village cadres to transfer the village, I was still picking grass in the field. ”
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 acres of land, planted rice, and is growing well now. ”
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner, "No one wants their home to be flooded, so let's give up a small family for everyone." ”
In order to cope with the continuous high water pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei City, Anhui Province, is preparing to open the Jiangkou River Lianwei flood storage on the 26th, where Fu Kunbao's house is located.
Jiangkou River Lianwei is located in Feixi County, close to Chaohu Lake Embankment.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and Sanhe Township who need to be relocated.
As of 16 o'clock on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.7 meters.
Fu Kunbao's kitchen was clean, with a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, eggs and some braised vegetables in the refrigerator.
"I didn't expect to move, the water of the Jiangkou River is currently good. ”
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large objects have not been thought about where to put them for the time being.
"Pack up your valuables first, and you can temporarily put large items such as refrigerators and televisions at the homes of neighbors or relatives on high ground. ”
Wang Liwen, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao an idea.
Wang Liwen was responsible for the relocation and resettlement of 13 villagers, notifying each household and confirming the resettlement plan for each person.
The closest resettlement point to Fu Kunbao's house is Su Primary School in Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the large items, Fu Kunbao and his family also had a headache of more than 1,000 catties of food and some newly bought furniture at home.
"The food was going to be dragged to the relative's house, and the furniture couldn't be moved. ”
As soon as the couple discussed, they put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 p.m., Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to relatives' houses, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
At around 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple looked back and forth at home, pulled the electric switch, and prepared to go to the resettlement site.
"I hope the water recedes soon. ”
Fu Kunbao said.
At half past nine o'clock in the morning of July 26, the reporter saw at the scene of Jiangkou River Lianwei that the local government had made various preparations before flood distribution.
Zhang Ji Colin Xiaozhai teamed up to support the muscular teenager-Xinhuanet
The sports teenager hot blood competition show "Sports Bar Boy" officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai crossed the same stage, Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on their own styles, and the hardcore appearance of the "behemoth" power pulling device made the show even more "burning".
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, and while their appearance amazed the audience, the "strong conflict", "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the arena also attracted attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" came from Qiao Wenyi, a super A sports student, who openly provoked Xu Zhibin, who was known as a "beautiful man" in the same track, before the game, choking Xu Zhibin's appearance conditions should go to singing and dancing programs, and even released cruel words of "don't put on makeup and cry if you lose".
The remarks made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field gasp.
And the "strong confrontation" is more like a fight between the gods, Sun Jianqi, who is known as the "Great Demon King", met Zhang Xindong, who was also strong, and staged a strong showdown.
And their identities are also unexpected, Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special combat member and a three-time Warrior Medal winner.
As soon as the competition began, the two teenagers tried their best to quickly pull out the small club, and the protracted confrontation on the big bar made the audience sweat for them.
In the tense situation, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of "Sports Bar Boy", also watched the game seriously.
In the comment session, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the teenager who lost the game, and helping every mistake in the review process.
And the sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai is a fancy assist, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers who are online in terms of appearance and strength.
When I learned about the overloaded daily training of athletic teenagers, I was even more impressed.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles, one is a calm and relaxed "prophet", and the other is a "desolate girl" who dispels tension with a smile.
In addition, Ji Ke Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of hilarious topics around sports teenagers.
Nantes church fire in France: parish volunteers admit arson, usually kind and silent-chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, July 26 According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, a religious and historical architectural treasure in Nantes, France, was seriously damaged in a fire, and the large pipe organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer who was in charge of guarding the cathedral had been indicted for "arson and destruction".
He has confessed that he was the one who lit the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he lit three fires in the cathedral at night.
The man's lawyer said the arsonist now regretted doing the thing.
This person had been evacuated to France a few years earlier, where he was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred and taken in in a church.
The prosecution pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police about it.
But the church said it still couldn't believe that this believer, who was usually very kind and smiling, but didn't talk much, would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police for a logical problem in his account, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters at the scene for rescue.
On the evening of the 25th, the person was again arraigned as the professional engineers of the laboratory of the Central Police Department in Paris obtained new evidence.
This time, the man confessed to his act of arson.
According to reports, if convicted of intentional arson, the suspect could face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to the report, the fire caused serious damage to the cathedral of Saint-Pierre and Saint-Paul, the pipe organ in the church was completely burned down, and the stained glass windows behind the pipe organ were also seriously damaged.
According to Brunet, the chief architect of the French historic building, it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: U.S. unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries, and international public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the United States-Xinhuanet
Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permit for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious troubles in Sino-US relations, and that it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocation of the United States and to take countermeasures.
Andrés Bolkes, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and caused a crisis in the relations between the two major countries.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Center for Arab-Chinese Studies, believes that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocations of the United States, and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The U.S. is trying to distract the U.S. public by pressuring China to cover up its ineffective response to the pandemic.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic posture adopted by the United States has caused serious troubles to Sino-US relations, and the relations between the two countries are facing severe challenges.
China's notification to the United States that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure that is in line with diplomatic practice, which not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the reasonableness, advantage, and restraint of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwinza said that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary response to US provocations.
For China-US relations to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve economic and political win-win results with China, and how to benefit the people of both countries and the international community as a whole.
Ali Youssef, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures that China is forced to take are a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, which are in line with international law and basic norms governing international relations, as well as diplomatic practices.
Earlier, the US side demanded the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which seriously violated international law and basic norms governing international relations.
It is hoped that the US side will revoke its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore's "Lianhe Zaobao" published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the United States' step-by-step pressure, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has no choice but to take countermeasures.

At present, the case is under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Coast Guard Bureau said that in the future, it will continue to maintain a high-pressure situation, crack down on all kinds of illegal and criminal activities of smuggling at sea, and maintain good order in the waters under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane "Hannah" landed in Texas or caused river surges and flash floods
Chinanews.com, July 26 Comprehensive foreign media reported that at 5 pm local time on the 25th, Hurricane "Hannah" landed in Texas, USA, which will bring strong storms and rain to Texas, river water surges, and may also cause life-threatening flash floods.
Hurricane Hannah is expected to carry torrential rain across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, which could trigger surges in some streams and life-threatening flash floods, the National Hurricane Center said.
Hurricane Hannah was most affected by the city of Corpus Christi south of the Rio Grande estuary, while widespread flash flooding could occur in the Rio Grande Valley, the report said.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge. ”
Thirty-two counties in the state are in a state of disaster emergency due to the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city of more than 320,000 people, has closed its library and museum, and residents are waiting for it.
Abbott also said that the hurricane cannot be allowed to inflict more casualties on Texas at a time when the state is being hit hard by the pandemic.
Precipitation is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches in southern Texas on the night of the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches of rain will also occur in northern Texas and coastal Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, "Hannah" formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
In general, the first hurricanes in the Atlantic usually don't form until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on Protection against Violence against Women, Poland's Justice Ministry said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty violated the rights of students' parents by requiring schools to teach students about gender issues.
Poland's Justice Minister Gioblo said at a press conference that his Justice Ministry would submit a request to the Ministry of Labor and Family on Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements of what we consider to be harmful forms of meaning. ”
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its coalition partners have close alliances with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda has made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, held protests in Warsaw and a number of other cities against withdrawal from the convention.
Lempat, one of the organizers of the protests, said at a protest march in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence".
Some protesters carried banners that read "Law and Justice is a hell for women".
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The PiS government says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
So far, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

The engine may stall, and the FAA urgently ordered 2,000 Boeing airliners-Xinhuanet
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring emergency inspections of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, because the air check valve of the above-mentioned passenger aircraft may be corroded and the engine may stop in the air.
The FAA stated that, to date, it had received four reports of 737NG and 737Classic aircraft engine stops in the air, and had therefore requested urgent inspections of aircraft that had been parked for seven days or more and for aircraft that had flown less than 11 times to date since they were re-commissioned.
The FAA has warned that if the 5th stage check valves of all two engines of the airliner are corroded, they could get stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to lose power completely and unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that if a corroded check valve is found, the airline operator must replace this critical component before the aircraft can be put into service again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the coronavirus outbreak had reduced travel demand, and many passenger planes were mothballed or less used, and "check valves are more likely to corrode".
At the same time, Boeing said that it has advised airline operators to inspect the airliners covered by the directive, and if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in overhauling and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that the planes of major U.S. airlines typically fly multiple times a day, but a large number of passenger planes were grounded after the coronavirus outbreak, and some have reopened operations as passenger travel demand has slowly increased recently.
The FAA did not release details of the four reports on air parking.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents late on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its airliners was en route from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15 when an engine suddenly stalled and the plane made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the plane's engines and had inspected the engines of six planes in accordance with FAA directives.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines respectively said on the 24th that their passenger planes did not have an engine stall associated with an air check valve.
Four American Airlines planes will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines planes will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 planes, but did not say if there had been engine stalls.
Several media outlets reported that the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive was another blow to Boeing.
One Boeing 737 MAX each of Indonesia's Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, killing a total of 346 people.
The series of aircraft was subsequently grounded worldwide, production was discontinued in January this year, and production resumed in May.
FAA Administrator Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA had "erroneously" in its oversight of Boeing over the 737 MAX.

It often replenishes the "nutrients" of the history of the party and the history of new China
2020-07-26 17:37:29 Source: People's Tribune Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized when visiting the Siping Battle Memorial Hall: "It is necessary for the 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, to learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China. ”
Conscientiously studying the history of the party and the history of new China is a compulsory course for party members and cadres not to forget their original intention and keep their mission in mind.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the arduous struggle and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and demonstrates the faith and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, and the original intention and mission that they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook, and for party members and cadres, the history of the party and the history of new China are the most brilliant chapters in this textbook.
Every party member and cadre must continue to strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a mirror and moving towards the future, based on the new journey and new mission, take the "baton" of the times, and take the long march of the current generation.
Cast the soul with history, and stick to the original mission in learning the history of the party and the history of new China.
Turning over the history of the Party and the history of New China, it is full of the eternal original mission and rock-solid belief of the Chinese Communists, demonstrating the simple feelings of the Communists who will always be with the people.
To get a close understanding of the important events, important meetings, and important figures in the history of the Party and the history of New China is not only an intuitive spiritual shock and ideological baptism, but also a deep understanding of the connotation of the original belief and the weight of the mission.
For party members and cadres, if they want to continue to strengthen their original mission and always maintain their advanced nature, they must find the origin of our departure and the fulcrum of our original intention from the history of the party and the history of new China, maintain a clear understanding and firm position, stir up the strength to fight bravely for the country and the people, and ensure that the red country and country laid down by the revolutionary ancestors with their blood and lives will be passed on from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history, and inherit the noble spirit in the study of the history of the party and the history of new China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the spirit of the Red Boat, the spirit of Jinggangshan, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yan'an, the spirit of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the spirit of Xibaipo, the spirit of "two bombs and one satellite", and the spirit of aerospace.
These great spirits precipitated by history have provided a powerful spiritual encouragement for our party to overcome all kinds of risks and challenges on the road ahead, and are precious spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away, or snatched away.
The process of studying the history of the party and the history of China is a process of rediscovering these spirits and shaping one's own spirit, and we must consciously take the lofty spirit of our revolutionary ancestors as a mirror, stick to the spiritual home of the communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, inherit and carry forward these spirits, and shine with the light of the new era.
Read history and introspect yourself, and constantly preserve the good and dispel the evil in the study of the history of the party and the history of new China.
For party members and cadres, there has never been a piece of history that can bring more profound warnings, enlightenment and reference than the history of the party and the history of new China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can see not only the great deeds of the revolutionaries of the older generation who were determined to dedicate themselves to their beliefs and indomitable in their struggle to achieve the set goals, but also the profound lessons of certain figures who have come to the opposite side of the revolution because of their wavering ideals and convictions, enlightening and warning us to never stagnate or slack off with firm determination and will, always maintain a full and tenacious fighting spirit, and constantly purify the Party spirit and self-cultivation.
If you want to truly become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, you need to brush off the ideological "dust" and strictly prevent the "dirt" from staining your body, and the history of the party and the history of new China should become the basis for every party member and cadre to examine themselves and warn themselves.
Knowing history is inspirational, and bravely taking on the important tasks of the times in studying the history of the party and the history of new China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Studying the history of the Party and the country is a compulsory course for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and continuing to push forward the various undertakings of the Party and the country." ”
Looking back at history and asking about the original intention, in order to continue the glory and move towards the future.
Every party member and cadre should take the study of the history of the party and the history of new China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in the study, bravely undertake the historical mission in their respective posts, dare to take responsibility, and take the initiative.
We should persist in taking the advanced deeds of the revolutionaries of the older generation as a reference and guide, constantly polish the political nature of the communists, maintain the attitude of seizing the day and working hard to make progress, and the spirit of struggle to move forward in the face of difficulties and dangers, and write our own brilliant strokes in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
"Plugging the Jiangnan" in pursuit of the poetic "Yellow River Dream"-Chinanews.com
(China's Poverty Alleviation Story) "Plugging the Jiangnan" in pursuit of the poetic "Yellow River Dream"
China News Service Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) "Jiuqu Yellow River is thousands of miles of sand, and the waves are blowing from the end of the world. ”
The Yellow River, which has aroused the pride of countless literati, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain, and now, Ningxia, which is known as "plugging the south of the Yangtze River", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
The "Dream of Blue Waves" with beautiful rivers and clear waters
"The Yellow River in the world is rich in Ningxia", the Yellow River flows through Ningxia for 397 kilometers, and is the "mother river" of the nurturing party.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, there is an imbalance between the development and utilization of rivers and lakes and the management and protection, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, land reclamation of lakes and encroachment on water areas has become prominent, resulting in black and odorous water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment, and ecological degradation.
At present, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecology and striving to restore the Yellow River.
Water control should start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government has adopted the method of "upgrading + pollution control + strict management", and all the sewage in the industrial park has been centrally treated, and all the urban sewage treatment plants have been discharged according to the first-class A standard, and the black and odorous water bodies in the urban built-up areas have been basically eliminated, and the third batch of China's black and odorous water demonstration cities have been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake chief system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake chief responsibility system in districts, cities, counties and villages, and river and lake chief patrols have become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, who lives in a village near the Yellow River, has witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: "The water used to smell bad, but after the remediation, the smell is gone. ”
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better, his life is more comfortable, and now he often goes to the Yellow River with his family for a walk to feel the clear water and blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of Sand Gull Xiangji
Birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water...... Fan Zhongyan's beautiful scenery of "sand gulls soaring" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia and forms a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, and swamp wetlands along the way, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and water ecological balance, and also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, Ningxia departments have invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects, and at present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%, nearly 200 natural lakes and swamp wetlands, 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, and 8 municipal-level parks.
Lv Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, especially in birds, "The relict gull is an endangered bird, there are only more than 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 inhabit the Yinchuan wetland." ”
At the same time, Ningxia has delineated a red line of 500 meters in the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that no unit or individual shall carry out development, construction or business activities within the protected area except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of the Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through the treatment of pollution sources, the comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology and the construction of terminal wetlands, the water quality of nine major drainage ditches in Ningxia has reached 100% of the Class IV standard. ”
The "Drinking Water Dream" of Benefiting People's Livelihood
Yinchuan City in Ningxia once had an "embarrassing" title: it was the only city along the Yellow River that "guarded the Yellow River and lacked water to drink".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing the problem of continuous water shortage during the peak summer season, and the "pain of water shortage" in the past ten years has become the painful summer experience of many high-rise residents, but under the current situation that the major water sources are at the limit of over-exploitation and a large area of groundwater over-exploitation funnel has been formed under the urban underground, the water-source water shortage has become a problem that plagues Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking the purified Yellow River water has become a good solution to the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of the Yinchuan Municipal Water Affairs Bureau, said that in order to improve the water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan for domestic production and production, Ningxia launched the water supply project of the western line of urban and rural areas in the Yinchuan metropolitan area in a timely manner, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
On December 29, 2019, the water supply project was officially opened to the three districts of Yinchuan City, and in 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the water of the Yellow River. ”
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will consider the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply, "the next step, we will integrate the scattered water supply points in the countryside and connect all to the west line water supply project, and it is expected that the urban and rural integrated water supply in Yinchuan will be basically realized by the end of this year." ”
Compacting responsibilities and strengthening flood prevention and disaster relief work in all departments-Chinanews.com
Compacting responsibilities All departments have strengthened flood prevention and disaster relief work
CCTV News (News Network): News from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12 o'clock today (July 25), the section below Wangjiaba, the main stream of the Huai River, was 0.64~3.31 meters above the alert water level, and the section below Liusha City and the two lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were 0.05~2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has been above the alert level for 28 days since June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, the General Economic Council of the People's Republic of China decided to continue to maintain the flood control level II response of the Yangtze River and Huai He, and asked all localities to consolidate their responsibilities and further implement all aspects of flood prevention and disaster relief.
Today, the National Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently dispatched professional flood drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve problems such as urban waterlogging caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation against China on the grounds that the RMB exchange rate was undervalued
In response to the recent announcement of the U.S. Department of Commerce, it decided to launch an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation on cable ties (cable ties) products originating in China, and launched an investigation on the "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has opened a case to investigate the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" in a countervailing case, and China firmly opposes this.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, stating that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that overall, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the renminbi has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the renminbi appreciated by 38%, and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%, making it the strongest currency among the G20 economies and one of the largest currencies in the world.
The Commerce Department noted that the exchange rate issue exceeded the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations under World Trade Organization rules.
In February this year, the United States amended its laws and regulations to conduct a countervailing investigation on the exchange rates of other countries, which is suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many quarters.
The press release said that even under U.S. regulations, the applicant's complaint contained a large number of errors and did not meet the necessary countervailing elements such as financial assistance, benefit awarding and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations on the so-called "undervaluation of the renminbi exchange rate".
Affected by the further escalation of tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar depreciated sharply on the 22nd, both falling below the 7.0 yuan mark of 1 US dollar against the yuan.
It will be interesting to see whether the U.S. Department of Commerce's move is intended to force the renminbi to rise.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd and closed at 6.9961.
The central parity of the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar, which is regulated by the government, was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic, the film and television industry, which has been silent for nearly half a year, has also returned to normal.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister accuses the United States of fabricating lies and unprovoked attacks on China-Xinhuanet
Arreasa said that the US Government has recently exerted constant pressure on China in the political, diplomatic, economic, and public opinion fields, which is a baseless attack on a sovereign country.
Arreaza made the comments after retweeting a tweet posted earlier in the day by Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong on his personal account.
Li Baorong said in a tweet that China strongly condemns the forced entry of the US side into the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which is a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Sino-US Consular Treaty, and China will respond to it properly and necessary.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodríguez, Vice Foreign Minister Carlos Long in charge of North American affairs, and other government officials, celebrities and mainstream media reporters also retweeted Li Baorong's tweet, condemning the United States' actions as serious violations of international law.

To this end, PCOO has prepared a special task force for employees who have not been exposed to confirmed cases to cooperate with President Duterte's press release on SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanar said in an interview with DZBB Radio on the 26th that two sets of plans have been prepared for President Duterte to announce the SONA method.
According to Plan A, Duterte will deliver a SONA speech at the Philippine Congress (Batasang Pambansa) building in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Due to the pandemic, only 50 seats were allocated for some government cabinet members and legislators, and a video conference room was set up for other cabinet members and local government officials to watch.
All participants will pass a rapid test on the day before entering the Capitol building.
Once one of the participants tests positive, Plan B will be launched, in which President Duterte will deliver a SONA speech at the Malaccanan Palace, the presidential palace, with fewer seats on site.
As is customary, SONA will broadcast live to the Philippines in real time.
As of press time, the Philippine presidential office has not confirmed whether Duterte's family will attend SONA.
Andanar said President Duterte's SONA will focus on how the government will lead the Philippines in its response to the coronavirus pandemic and restore its socio-economic life, and will also mention his commitment to fight government corruption, fight illegal drugs and reduce poverty.
Duterte will also outline his administration's other plans, including creating more jobs, reviving the economy, boosting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers who have suffered during the pandemic.
Yinchuan: Classified policies support kindergartens to stabilize the teaching team-Xinhuanet
Yinchuan, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Affected by the epidemic, kindergartens in Yinchuan City, Ningxia have not yet reopened, especially the financial pressure on private kindergartens, which has a certain impact on the stability of kindergarten teachers and the sustainable development of the future.

The Yangtze River Flood No. 3 in 2020 was formed, and the Ministry of Water Resources refined and implemented the response measures-Chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Hu Lu) On the 26th, the No. 3 flood of 2020 on the Yangtze River formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, Minister of Water Resources E Jingping demanded that the Three Gorges Reservoir be carefully dispatched, the water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake should be considered as a whole, and the peak dispatch should be staggered, so as to reserve enough storage capacity to prepare for the possible major floods, and ensure the flood control safety of the main stream of the middle and lower reaches and the important embankments of Dongting Lake.
According to the forecast, in the next three days, there will be heavy to heavy rain in parts of the eastern part of the southwest, the southern part of Jianghuai, the western part of the northern part of the Yangtze River, the southern part of the eastern part of Hubei, and the central part of Guangxi, of which there will be heavy rain in the northern part of Hunan and the southwestern part of Jiangsu, and there will be moderate to heavy rain in the central and western parts of North China, and there will be heavy rain in the central part of Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources predicts that under its influence, the inflow of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second around the 28th, and the water level of the Lianhuatang River section and Dongting Lake in the middle reaches of the main stream will rise again and exceed the guarantee by about 0.20 meters; the water level of the main stream of the middle reaches of the Huai River will generally recede, and the water level of Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly; and the water system of the Haihe River, the Daqing River, the Yongding River, and other rivers will rise slowly.
E Jingping proposed that the Huaihe River valley should further intensify flood drainage, lower the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare for the possibility of a major flood.
It is necessary to fully do a good job in dealing with the heavy rain and floods in the Yishu River system.
He said that the Taihu Lake basin should continue to increase flood discharge without slackening, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water levels and typhoons in Taihu Lake.
In addition, he stressed that the flood in Inner Mongolia, Hebei and other northern regions rises and falls sharply, and the early warning time is short, which is very easy to cause flash floods and debris flow disasters, and it is difficult to prevent them; there are many small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams, which pose potential safety hazards.
58 APPs that infringe on users' rights and interests have been exposed, involving more than 10 listed companies-Chinanews.com
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology pointed out that in accordance with the "Cybersecurity Law", "Telecommunications Regulations", "Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users" and other laws and regulations, a third-party testing agency has recently been organized to inspect mobile phone application software, and urge enterprises with problems to rectify.
The problems existing in these 58 apps include private collection of personal information, excessive collection of personal information, frequent application for permissions, excessive requests for permissions, difficulty in account cancellation, private sharing with third parties, and non-use of permissions.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requires that 58 APPs should complete the implementation of rectification before July 30, and if they are not rectified within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will organize and carry out relevant disposal work in accordance with laws and regulations.
The reporter of Sino-Singapore Jingwei combed and found that behind the 58 APPs reported, more than ten U.S. stocks, Hong Kong stocks, and A-share listed companies were involved.
For example, "Fang Duoduo" is a product of Fang Duoduo, a U.S.-listed company, and there are five major problems: collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, sharing it with third parties without permission, forcing users to use the targeted push function, and frequently applying for permissions.
According to public information, Fangduoduo landed on the NASDAQ in November 2019 and is "the first real estate agency company in China with the SaaS (software as a service) model of industrial Internet", providing online solutions for many intermediary merchants.
In response to the difficulty in canceling the "Qunar" APP account pointed out in the notice, according to the Beijing News, Qunar responded that in order to prevent the black industry from using frequent registration and cancellation to seek benefits, Qunar has set up an interval of one month for registration and cancellation on the basis of self-cancellation.
Considering the convenience of cancellation and account security, the cancellation has been changed to take effect immediately, and is currently waiting for review.
A cybersecurity expert, who did not want to be named, told the Zhongxin Jingwei client that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued three APP notices this year that infringe on the rights and interests of users.
Among them, the three problems of collecting personal information without permission, excessive request for permissions, and difficulty in canceling accounts have been repeatedly "managed".
It can also be found from the report that the invasion of privacy by APP has attracted more and more attention.
On July 24, the day of the notification of 58 apps that infringed on users' rights and interests, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it had recently issued a notice to deploy and carry out in-depth special rectification actions to promote APP infringement of users' rights and interests.
The special rectification will strengthen oversight and inspections in accordance with regulations, urging relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of personal information in apps, promptly rectifying and eliminating outstanding problems such as the illegal collection and use of users' personal information and harassment of users, deception and misleading users, and inadequate implementation of management responsibilities for application distribution platforms, to purify the app application space.
Lewis Family: John Lewis was a fighter who "fought for the weakest."
John Lewis, a member of the U.S. Congress and civil rights fighter, was remembered as a fighter who "fought for the weakest" at a memorial service for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis's public memorial service began Saturday in Alabama.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis's five siblings and a grandnephew spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
Lewis's youngest brother, Henry." Henry "Grant" Lewis said at the conference, "He dedicated his life to helping others. ”
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "Don't get into trouble, don't get into trouble." ”
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying, "We all know that John always gets into trouble, always gets into trouble, but that's because he insists on what is right, and that's a good trouble." ”
Lewis's siblings reminded those at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create "good trouble," that is, not to shy away from stirring up trouble as long as it was for the sake of justice.
John applied to Troy University, in his birthplace of Troy, Alabama, but Troy University, which was an all-white school at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said the current protesters are "protesting peacefully, nonviolently," just as Lewis did during the civil rights movement.
"Even if President Trump overturned a boatload of people with a rod and called all the protesters a mob, he was wrong," Jones said.
The protesters were patriots who wanted the United States to move toward a more egalitarian nation. ”
A six-day series of events in honor of Lewis culminates this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis's coffin rested at a public memorial service at Troy University on Saturday, where people came to pay their respects to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony honored him in a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis's body will pass the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and demonstrators demanding black voting rights were beaten by Alabama state police in front of the bridge, who fired tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
This day later became known as "Bloody Sunday."
Lewis's remains will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to walk this last leg with Lewis.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain social distancing when participating in the event.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered flags to be lowered at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis's body will be laid to rest at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could pay their respects to Lewis at the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, a public event honoring Lewis will be held outdoors.

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during his inspection in Jilin Province that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the party, promote the extension of party organizations to the grassroots level, improve the work system of grassroots party organizations, and provide a strong guarantee for urban and rural community governance.
Adhering to the guidance of party building and implementing the party's leadership in all fields and all aspects of grassroots governance is the direction and fundamental requirement for doing a good job in grassroots governance.
To improve the level of grassroots governance, we must adhere to the guidance of party building, and promote the transformation of the party's political, organizational and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political guidance, building a fighting fortress, and condensing red power, so as to transmit the party's strength and propositions to the "nerve endings" and "last mile".
Pay attention to calcium and cast the soul, and strengthen political guidance.
To strengthen the political guidance of grassroots governance, we must implement the project of "calcium supplementation and soul casting".
It is necessary to take learning and understanding Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the primary task, and take "not forgetting the original intention and remembering the mission" as the eternal topic of party building and the lifelong topic of party members and cadres, strengthen the reading of original works to learn the principles of original understanding, and continue to promote the party's innovative theoretical arming through special training, batch training, seminars and exchanges, and holding lecture halls, etc., and promote party members and cadres to further enhance the "four consciousnesses", strengthen the "four self-confidences", and achieve the "two maintenances", so as to better perform their duties and responsibilities.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grassroots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into daily life and grasp it regularly.
Pay attention to practical training, and in the process of resolving key and difficult problems in the field of grassroots governance, solve the troubles and troubles that the masses are concerned about, and temper the party spirit and ability.
Grasp the improvement of standards and build a battle fortress.
Grassroots party organizations are not only an important part of the grassroots governance system, but also an important carrier of governance ability.
To promote the standardized construction of grass-roots party organizations, it is necessary to start with the regulations on the work of party branches, focus on the weakening and virtualization of party organization leadership, and consolidate the foundation, make up for shortcomings, and promote development by establishing a linkage mechanism up and down, innovating the form of branch settings, normalizing and rectifying weak and sloppy, establishing and improving decision-making and deliberation mechanisms, and serving the masses.
In rural areas, strengthen the standardization of village-level party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities, and management mechanisms according to the standardized construction standards of party branches, and earnestly promote the detailed implementation of systems such as "three meetings and one lesson" and themed party day activities.
In the city, pay attention to the neighborhood community, explore the form of innovative branch settings, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", and actively build urban party building alliances, so that the party's work can be effectively covered.
At the same time, establish and improve the system and mechanism of grassroots governance and governance, improve the decision-making and deliberation mechanism led by party members, improve the mechanism of joint discussion of major matters, joint handling of practical matters, joint decision of important matters, joint consultation of urgent matters, joint solution of difficult matters, and grass-roots party organizations, improve the mechanism for party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather the hearts of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor, and pride of the party members and the masses, and make grassroots governance more warm.
Play a pioneering role and gather red power.
Grassroots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grassroots governance.
To improve the ability of grassroots governance, it is important to improve the governance ability of grassroots party members and cadres, pay attention to the demonstration and leading role of "red cells" in grassroots governance, and gather red power at the forefront of connecting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for grassroots party members and cadres, continuously strengthen ideological refining, professional training, and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their own posts and urgent, difficult, dangerous and heavy tasks, and lay a solid foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity.
It is necessary to extensively carry out the activities of "community whistleblowing and party member registration", and participate in community construction, management and service by participating in themed party day activities, contacting the people in difficulty, determining service projects, claiming micro-wishes, and putting forward reasonable suggestions, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed party members in rural areas, and guide the majority of grassroots party members to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, petition maintenance, straw burning ban and other work by setting up vanguard posts for unemployed party members and forming a task force for unemployed party members, so as to better integrate the red force and serve the people.
The foundation is solid, and the building is strong.
Grassroots party organizations are the foundation of the ruling edifice.
Only by insisting on the close relationship between the party and the masses and increasing the well-being of the people as the focus, and taking the guidance of party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovation and development of grassroots governance, can we build a solid foundation, so that the grassroots party organizations can pull out and stand up, and the grassroots party members and cadres can catch up and rush up, and promote the grassroots governance to have a "soul", orderly, powerful and effective.

The Tibetan antelope of Hoh Xili enters the migration season-Xinhuanet
Xining, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Hoh Xil Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that monitoring shows that the Tibetan antelopes that had previously migrated to the Zhuo Nai Lake area in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth are successively finishing their littering and beginning to return to their original habitat with their young.
Surveillance footage near the Wudaoliang Protection Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three Tibetan antelope cubs through the 3,002 kilometers of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, and the Tibetan antelope has begun to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope pups in the relocated sheep herd has accounted for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope herds.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early days of migration, the Tibetan antelope faces a high risk of predation, so the number of pups in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no pups. ”
According to the statistics of the Hoh Xil Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning has been increasing year by year, with 4,860 Tibetan antelopes returning in 2019, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "It is expected that the return of Tibetan antelopes will end in early September this year, and the number of Tibetan antelopes returning is still expected to continue to increase." ”
The Tibetan antelope is a national first-class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from the source of the three rivers in Qinghai, the Qiangtang in Tibet, and the Altun Mountains in Xinjiang go to Zhuo Nai Lake in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert in Tibetan antelope conservation in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: "The migration of Tibetan antelopes is a process in which female Tibetan antelopes return to their habitats with their young after giving birth. Initially, large groups of returnees leave their farrowing sites, but then Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats along different paths depending on the geographical population. ”
In order to ensure the safe return of the Tibetan antelope herd, the reporter learned that the Hoh Xil Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continue to carry out video monitoring and patrol in the main relocation area.
If a herd of Tibetan antelopes is found trying to cross the road, the patrol team will immediately carry out temporary traffic control to allow the sheep to pass safely through the wildlife passage and ensure that they are least disturbed by humans on the way back.
So, how to relieve the heat in daily life?
Experts recommend that when going out in the summer, try to avoid hot periods, and it is best not to walk or work in the scorching sun around noon, because the sun is most intense during this time period, and the possibility of heat stroke is higher.
If you must go out during this time, you must do a good job of protection, such as wearing a parasol, wearing a sunhat, wearing sunglasses, and it is best to apply sunscreen if possible to prevent sunburn.
Try to choose light-colored, breathable cotton, linen and silk textures, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to dissipate heat in time when sweating a lot, causing heat stroke.
In hot and sultry weather, you should prepare enough water to drink, drink it in time, don't wait until you are thirsty to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, your body is already short of water, drink water at 150 ml to 200 ml each time, drink warm water, do not drink ice water.
Depending on the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, and the high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
When you sweat a lot, you can properly supplement some salt water to make up for the salt lost by the human body due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency in summer, making people feel tired and tired, potassium-containing tea is an excellent drink to cool off.
In summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc., fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., with a water content of 80% to 90%, can be used to replenish water, and dairy products can not only replenish water, but also meet the body's nutritional needs.
In addition, people who work in a high-temperature environment should appropriately supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days are long and the nights are short, the temperature is high, the body's metabolism is vigorous, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel fatigue.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heat stroke.
Experts say that the best time to go to bed is between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., and the best time to wake up is between 5:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m.
Be careful not to lie down under the air vent of the air conditioner and the electric fan when sleeping, so as not to suffer from air conditioning sickness and heat cold.
Experts suggest that people who are outdoors or working in high temperatures can carry ten drops of water, Rendan, Huoxiang Zhengqi Water or Huoxiang Zhengqi Pills and other heatstroke prevention medicines, or place them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent heat stroke.

In the context of the pandemic, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Pingping, head of Chaoyang Joy City Art Chen, said: "We chose to bring the graduation exhibition that went to the 'cloud' back to the offline space, and we also hope that more people can see young people's exploration of themselves and their understanding of the world, and amplify the healing power of art for society and soul." ”
She revealed that the works in this exhibition were collected from the graduates of several major art academies, and selected those suitable for commercial space display, and the forms of works range from traditional easel paintings and sculptures to new media installations, interactive animations, and VR panoramas, with the largest volume and richness in the past.

Among the few graduates who set up the exhibition in person was Li Jingyin from the sculpture department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, and I was actually a little worried about the epidemic at that time, so I did a nucleic acid test three days in advance, and I came to the exhibition with alcohol cotton and test report. ”
His work "Yesterday is a Mystery" has a complex structure and must be done by himself.
At the same time, he also undertakes the task of helping his classmates repair damaged works.
"I set up the exhibition until half past four in the morning, and then I did the repairs, the time was very tight, and I forgot to take a photo with the works, which is also a bit regrettable. ”
He hopes that when the epidemic situation is more stable, he and his classmates will come to Beijing to see his own exhibition.

Reward of 50,000 yuan, Hubei Enshi praised Shaziba landslide "the first person to warn" - Chinanews.com
Hubei Daily News (Reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, Enshi City commended Chen Guangming, a geological disaster point monitor who made important contributions to the early warning of Shaziba landslide, and gave him a bonus of 50,000 yuan.
At the same time, the city's party members and cadres were called on to learn from his spirit of dedication, daring to take responsibility, taking the initiative and being willing to contribute.
On July 21, Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of a landslide in the Shaziba of Mazhi Village, Tunpu Township, Enshi City, which caused a dammed lake to form in the main stream of the Qingjiang River.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned that the walls of the villagers' homes were cracked and immediately went to the scene to check on them.
As soon as he walked five or six hundred meters out of his home, he saw that the village road had cracked four or five centimeters, and it stretched along the road to the cornfield, with a length of about 50 meters.
Chen Guangming was alert and immediately sent a photo of the cracking of the highway to the township's "Geological Disaster Monitor Contact Group".

UM develops new drug that is expected to be used to treat vascular blockages caused by the new crown - Xinhuanet
SYDNEY, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that could help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope it could be used to treat blockages in blood vessels caused by the coronavirus.
Researchers have found that before a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting.
As a result, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thereby preventing blood vessel clogging and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug only inhibits the clotting effect of platelets at the appearance of signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar blockages of blood vessels are one of the leading causes of death in patients with severe COVID, the researchers hope that the drug can be used in the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the stadium after the CBA league rematch allowed spectators to watch the game live.
On the same day, in the second phase of the 2019-2020 China Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) semi-final (Laoshan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong, medical staff, teachers, and public security frontline personnel entered the venue to watch the game between Shanghai Jiushi Team and Shandong Xiwang Team after completing the relevant processes including nucleic acid testing through the official ticketing platform.
During the game, spectators must wear masks throughout the race, sit in the right seats, and strictly maintain a one-meter spacing between them.
When exiting, the audience must leave the venue in an orderly manner in the order of back to front, first on both sides and then in the middle, maintaining a social distance of "one-meter line".
Xinjiang deeply cultivates the "sunflower field" and makes good use of clean energy-Chinanews.com

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang is deeply cultivating "sunflower fields" and making good use of clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each of 48 square meters, are arranged neatly in a circle, like a silver "sunflower field", which rotates with the sun and reflects the sunlight to the center of the heat absorption tower more than 200 meters high to achieve power generation.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the Hami molten salt tower solar thermal power plant of the China Power Project in Naomaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower solar thermal power generation is to reflect sunlight to the heat absorption tower through the mirror surface to form heat energy, and then convert the heat energy into electrical energy through traditional power generation technology. ”
Daniel Zhang, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said that the design principle is similar to that of solar cookers used in rural areas in northwest China, which all gather sunlight.
The plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres, with a total of 14,500 heliostat mirrors planned to be installed.
"The biggest advantage over conventional solar power generation technology is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night. ”
Daniel Zhang said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator sets running continuously and stably, not affected by light changes, and can also quickly participate in the peak regulation of the grid according to the peak and valley demand of the power grid.
After the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation of 198 million kWh, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamifu solar photovoltaic power station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres, and the 714 power generation equipment that has been built also rotates with the sun, always keeping the sunlight at a 90-degree right angle to the concentrating panel.
"We use dual-axis tracking concentrator power generation technology, and through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency. ”
Duan Mengqi, the station's director, said that under good weather conditions, the power generation technology can increase the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million kWh, supplementing the local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single scale and the most complete photovoltaic module type in Xinjiang, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects and a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, more than 110 million kWh of electricity was generated, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields".
More than 250 kilowatts of solar power generation has been built, and the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion kWh in the first half of this year, a year-on-year increase of about 14%.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that the annual photovoltaic power generation capacity will reach 15 billion kWh this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
The police reported the details of "female college students who went to Qinghai to travel and lost contact", and the search and rescue work continues-Xinhuanet
Xining, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Recently, "a female college student went missing after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai" has attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, reported on the 26th that Huang Moumou, a student at a university in Nanjing, is still in a state of disappearance, and the police in many places are going deep into the line where Huang Moumou lost contact and actively carrying out search work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Prefecture, received a notice from his superiors that Huang Moumou, a student at a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5, and turned off his mobile phone and lost contact with him in the southwest area of Qingshui River at the Sonam Dajie Protection Station in Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province on July 9, requesting assistance in finding him.
According to the investigation of the Golmud City Public Security Bureau, Huang Moumou entered Qinghai Province at 19:54 on July 6 and arrived in Golmud City at 4 o'clock on the 7th.
At 8 o'clock on the same day, the missing person Huang Moumou took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Golmud City towards the G109 National Highway, and arrived at the Hoh Xili Sonam Dajie Protection Station at 12 o'clock, the taxi driver returned alone, and Huang Moumou arrived at the Qingshui River area near the Sonam Dajie Protection Station at 15 o'clock on the 7th until about 18 o'clock on the 9th, and the phone was shut down in the area.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed through the Naijigou checkpoint at 17:07 on July 13.
The Naijigou checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Nagqu City in the Tibet Autonomous Region at Nanshankou in Golmud City, and because the checkpoint has no video surveillance, it is impossible to determine the information of the person and the vehicle he is riding in, so the police can only drive along the road to search, and coordinate with the checkpoints along the way in Tibet to immediately contact the Golmud City Public Security Bureau if Huang is found.
According to the latest situation, at 1 a.m. on July 26, the Golmud City Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to the Frozen Spring Protection Station and Sonam Dajie Protection Station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to search, and actively contacted the Sichuan police, Tibet police, and Nanjing police to carry out joint work.
The local police hope that if the majority of netizens and all walks of life have relevant clues, they will provide them to the Golmud police and the Nanjing Jiangning police in a timely manner, and strive to find the missing person Huang Moumou as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts remind that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized when they are outdoors, pay attention to roadside warning signs at any time, do not venture into no man's land, and call the police in time in case of emergencies.
The US media uncovered the truth about the unwarranted demand of the US side for China to close the Consulate General in Houston-Chinanews.com

The US media uncovered the truth about the unwarranted demand of the US side for China to close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation permit of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all operations and activities, as a countermeasure to the U.S. side's sudden request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
The U.S. government's actions have attracted a lot of attention, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is the Chinese side asking to close the Consulate General?
A number of foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media bluntly said: for the election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the U.S. side's move to ask China to close its consulate in Houston has raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the U.S. government's disastrous response to the new crown epidemic has caused President Trump's polling rating to be relatively sluggish before the election.
White House officials privately say that the hardline tactics toward China are aimed at salvaging Trump's approval ratings and deflecting responsibility for the failure of the White House's response to the pandemic.
The article argues that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven, very cautious" target chosen by the U.S. government, which was chosen "to create a hard-line attitude while avoiding the risk of a major conflict."
The BBC also believes that when the U.S. election season is approaching and the U.S. economy has been hit hard by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has a political advantage."
The current situation is "a spiraling,-for-tat struggle," driven in part by the U.S. government's domestic considerations, which will only exacerbate tensions between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects were weighed by the outbreak, which he has repeatedly blamed for China.
Almost every day, there are new actions in the United States against the absurdity of Trump's allegation that "China exploits the United States."
"The Consulate General Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries"
The Associated Press commented that the U.S. demand for China to close its consulate general in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world's two largest economies.
In addition to diplomatic implications, the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston would have difficulties accessing consular services for Chinese nationals in the southern United States, as well as for U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston regretted the U.S. demand that China close its consulate in Houston, saying that the consulate general has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to the website of the US magazine Foreign Policy, this move of the US side "is part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that this move by the US side is unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
The Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Houston was established in 1979 and is the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

Moscow, 26 Jul (Xinhua) -- Russian fleets held a military parade on 26 July to celebrate Navy Day and commemorate the 324th anniversary of the founding of the Russian Navy.
On the same day, Russia's North Sea, Baltic, Black Sea, Caspian and Pacific fleets held military parades in the waters where their respective bases are located, with a total of 15,000 soldiers, 219 ships of various types, and 71 military aircraft participating.
Russian President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Vladimir Putin attended the parade of the Baltic Fleet.
About 4,000 soldiers, 46 ships and more than 40 warplanes took part in the parade.
Putin first inspected the convoy of ships in the waters of the Kronstadt naval base in the Baltic Sea.
After that, he arrived on a speedboat in the waters of the Neva River in the center of St. Petersburg and went ashore to watch the military parade on the Neva.
Speaking at the parade, Putin said that the level of modernization of the Russian Navy's equipment has continued to improve in recent years, and the Russian Navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with a unique hypersonic strike system in 2020.
In addition, the commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, Yevmenov, said in an interview with the newspaper "Red Star", an organ of the Russian Ministry of Defense, that Russia's plan to build ships has been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships that the Russian Navy plans to receive in 2020 is the largest in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a naval fleet, creating the history of the Russian Navy.
Every year on the last Sunday of July is the Day of the Russian Navy.
In response to the new changes in the epidemic prevention and control work, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions and actively participated in the epidemic prevention and control work.
The cadres, workers and model workers of the trade unions in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains went into the neighborhoods, communities and residents to carry out activities such as delivering food and medicine, disinfection and sterilization, and publicizing epidemic prevention knowledge, serving the masses of workers and demonstrating the "hard core strength" of the trade unions with practical actions.
Recently, the condolence group of the Tianshan District Federation of Trade Unions in Urumqi City sent a batch of urgently needed epidemic prevention and control supplies to the staff of 12 isolation points.
After the outbreak of the epidemic, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan in the first time, and urgently allocated it to 23 directly subordinate grassroots trade unions.
After receiving the company's notice on epidemic prevention and control, Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and chairman of the labor union of China State Construction Xinjiang Construction Engineering First Construction Co., Ltd., took the initiative to ask for help and chose to stay on duty in the unit to escort the employees.
He delivered cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to the dormitory and newly recruited workers, and organized staff to deliver essential supplies to them every two days.
"Since July 21, the cadres and workers who have adhered to the front line of the war against the 'epidemic' have been investigated, and online orders and door-to-door delivery have been adopted to purchase epidemic prevention supplies and daily necessities for 704 front-line workers in Urumqi. ”
The person in charge of the Xinjiang transportation trade union told reporters that in the face of the sudden epidemic, they made every effort to ensure the service guarantee of epidemic prevention and control, steadily promote the development of transportation, and create a strong atmosphere of fighting the "epidemic" together.
At present, it is the high temperature in summer, and trade unions at all levels are paying close attention to front-line workers in key areas of epidemic prevention and control, and implementing the care and care of "sending coolness".
On July 19, the Urumqi County Federation of Trade Unions launched a "cool" condolence activity to the front-line workers of epidemic prevention and control, and the county's police stations, card points and health systems received drinks, fruits and other condolences.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political position, strengthen their responsibility, warm people's hearts with care, and inspire morale with action.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of trade union organizations in uniting and uniting employees, do a good job in epidemic prevention and control service guarantees, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of the majority of employees, and send care to front-line workers. ”
The relevant person in charge of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Autonomous Region said
In 2020, the work of direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers will be in full swing-Xinhuanet
Beijing, 26 Jul (Xinhua) -- The Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission (CMC) and the National Defense Mobilization Department of the Central Military Commission (CMC) recently jointly issued a circular to make arrangements for the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers from among graduates of ordinary institutions of higher learning in 2020.
This year's direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers covers more than 270 general military and civilian majors in 64 categories such as computers, automation, and machinery, focusing on increasing the recruitment of unmanned aerial vehicles, navigation, aerospace, electronic information, small languages and other majors, and the enrollment scale has increased by nearly 2,000 compared with last year.
This year, the work of direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers and the recruitment of conscripts will be organized and implemented simultaneously, starting on August 1 and ending on September 30.
Young conscripts can inquire about the conditions for direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers and the distribution of majors recruited in various places through the national conscription network (website: http://www.gfbzb.gov.cn), submit registration information online if they meet the scope of specialties and recruitment conditions, and participate in follow-up recruitment work such as physical examinations and political assessments according to the unified requirements of the military service organs in the places where they are recruited.
Qualified young people who are not recruited as non-commissioned officers due to restrictions on their majors and plans may participate in compulsory military recruitment, and when they are selected as non-commissioned officers at the end of their compulsory military service, the number of years they have studied in ordinary schools of higher learning in accordance with the prescribed academic system shall be regarded as the length of service.
This year, the recruitment of noncommissioned officers will be organized by the enlistment offices of the people's governments at the provincial or prefectural and municipal levels, and the majors with rich application potential will be selected on the basis of a comprehensive assessment of the educational level of the applicants, the results of the specialized courses they have taken during the school period, and the vocational qualification certificates they have obtained.
According to the requirements of normalized epidemic prevention and control, this year's directly recruited non-commissioned officers will not arrange self-registration in principle, and will organize transportation into the camp simultaneously with the conscripts.
The time for direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers into the army is counted from September 1, 2020, and the time for the army to issue the order for non-commissioned officers to serve is December 1, 2020.
After the training is completed, the noncommissioned officers will be uniformly and accurately assigned to the corresponding professional and technical posts in accordance with the principle of matching their specialties and recruiting them in a consistent manner.
Spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity-Chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, July 26 According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on the 25th, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered reporters' questions on erroneous remarks about cyber attacks.
The spokesperson stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to media reports, hacker groups linked to China have interfered with the network systems of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies that store patent data, and hacked into the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesperson said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace the source, and diverse actors, so sufficient evidence should be presented when investigating and characterizing cyber incidents, and no unwarranted speculation should be made.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as the "Prism Gate" in the past have proved that the United States has been carrying out the world's largest cyber theft operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation are not stolen or robbed, but are achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China filed about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a powerhouse in innovation and intellectual property.
According to data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China, in the first half of the year, new loans to agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the increase in the whole year of 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase loan allocation, providing sufficient financial guarantee for epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production.
Free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been basically completed in most districts of high-risk areas for secondary testing-Chinanews.com
Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th when reporting the latest epidemic situation and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi that at present, most districts of Urumqi City have basically completed the free nucleic acid testing work.
Experts from the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Information Office of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0:00 to 24:00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Urumqi (5 of which were asymptomatic infections turned into confirmed cases), and 38 new asymptomatic infections.
As of 24:00 on July 25, there are 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th were basically all through free nucleic acid testing and active screening in the city.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that most districts of Urumqi City have basically completed the free nucleic acid testing work.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of the country, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the detection reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested personnel, the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is collected (poor cooperation may lead to the specimen not being taken in place), the testing environment, the operation proficiency of the inspectors, etc.
False-negative results can also occur in nucleic acid tests due to various reasons.
The so-called false negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to rule them out.
For people who have been to medium- and high-risk areas of the epidemic, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, there is a possibility of false negatives if they have a negative nucleic acid test, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to rule it out.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting from today, Urumqi will conduct a second free nucleic acid test in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shayibak District, and at the same time carry out "checking and filling in the gaps".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shayibak District are high-risk areas for the epidemic.

Yesterday, the 2020 Shanghai International Film and Television Festival, held under the background of strict epidemic prevention measures, opened the curtain of the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival with an industry summit forum of "comprehensively running to a well-off society and building a dream for a new era".
As the first international film and television festival held since the continuous spread of the global epidemic and the normalization of China's epidemic prevention and control, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance.
On the basis of doing a good job in the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, holding the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is not only a demonstration of confidence, but also a declaration of determination - our confidence and determination to defeat the epidemic will remain unchanged, the confidence and determination to hold the people's festival will remain unchanged, and the confidence and determination to build a global film and television creation center and launch the "Shanghai Culture" brand will remain unchanged.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival is a new start and a new beginning with a continuous innovation and enterprising attitude.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step to serve the spiritual life of the people and the high-quality development of the film and television industry.
This year is even more so.
In order to cherish the hard-won epidemic prevention and control situation, the Shanghai International Film Festival has strictly adhered to the epidemic prevention requirements on the one hand and implemented the epidemic prevention and control measures in detail, and on the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the needs of movie fans, it has launched a multi-section activity that combines online and offline activities.
On the first day of the opening, from offline viewing to industry forums, the relevant activities of the film festival have strictly implemented relevant epidemic prevention policies.
The forum activities are controlled within 50 people, and the seating and attendance rate of each movie are strictly controlled within 30%.
As the organizing committee of the film festival upheld, no matter what, "putting the safety and health of the people's lives and health first" is the main premise.
Offline activities have been greatly streamlined, and the "cloud" has been much more lively.
In order to implement the important concept of "a people's city built by the people, a people's city for the people", and as a festival for the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival has innovated and transformed, using online "cloud screenings" and master classes "cloud sharing" to meet the diverse needs of movie fans.
On the first day of the opening ceremony, the official partners of the film festival, Migu Video and Oriental Pearl BesTV, respectively "went to the cloud" a number of "Belt and Road" films to give back to fans.
That night, the opening forum of Jinjue and Jia Zhangke's master class were also launched on multiple platforms such as CCTV, Learning Power, Wenhui App, etc., so that people can pay attention to the latest trends in Chinese films without leaving home.
At yesterday's opening forum, Yan Xiaoming, member of the party group and deputy director of China Central Radio and Television, delivered a speech and announced the opening of this film festival, Zhou Huilin, member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and director of the Propaganda Department, delivered a speech, and Vice Mayor Zong Ming attended.
White House epidemic expert Fauci: Cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Fauci made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leaders Foundation on the 25th.
He cautioned that it is not yet clear how the pandemic will develop in the autumn and winter, nor what its final impact will be, "and the only way to end it all is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution".
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, as of 21:00 on the 25th, the number of confirmed cases of the new crown in the United States has reached 4.176 million, and 146,000 deaths.
Fauci said some parts of the U.S. are currently struggling with a resurgence of the pandemic.
Although the epidemic situation varies from place to place and requires a tailored response, the diversity of anti-epidemic strategies does not mean that there are no strong links between regions.
Outbreaks in one region eventually affect other regions.
"Now is not the time for complacency," Fauci said, "and our work is not done, we must step up our efforts, and we must be vigilant about the uncertainty of the future." ”
He Dayi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of the "cocktail therapy" for the treatment of AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the new crown epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus. ”
He called on the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the research and development of new crown treatment drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting international exchange activities in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region, promoting the status of Asian Pacific Islanders in the United States and nurturing young international leaders.
On the same day, US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, US Congressman Meng Zhaowen, and Founding President of the International Leadership Foundation Dong Jiling spoke at the meeting.
In particular, they paid tribute to the AAPI medical workers and volunteers who are on the front lines of the fight against the epidemic, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to "social distancing" and other epidemic prevention guidelines to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-Chinanews.com
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Researchers in Brazil divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted a clinical trial to compare the effects of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other antibiotics azithromycin to see if it could help improve the condition of patients with mild and moderate COVID-19.
The results showed that hydroxychloroquine not only had no therapeutic effect, but could have damaging side effects on the organs.
The study was carried out by several leading hospitals in Brazil, such as Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Hospital of Heart Diseases (HCor), Hospital Sírio-Libanês, etc., in collaboration with the Brazilian Clinical Research Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Intensive Care Research Network (BRICNet).

On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo kicked off in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry is also facing the dilemma of a small number of young people, homogeneous tourism projects, and a single commercialization channel.
Especially this year, the epidemic struck, the national cultural and tourism industry suffered a serious setback, and red tourist attractions are also facing severe challenges.
For example, the use of drone photography, VR immersive experience and other scientific and technological means can meet the needs of tourists "people have not arrived, the scenery has arrived"; The introduction of webcast means to promote the famous and high-quality specialties of red scenic spots can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; Introduce "cloud" technology to create a boutique display with prominent themes, clear orientations and rich connotations, and fully display and enhance the propaganda and education functions of red scenic spots; Innovate the way of dissemination of red culture, make revolutionary cultural relics "live", make red tourism popular, let red genes be inherited, and enhance the attractiveness of red scenic spots.
The cultural festival uses the popular "county and city (district) mayor + professional anchor special promotion" method to promote red cultural tourism specialties, and uses 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and smart city demonstration and other services to promote red cultural tourism attractions, which are all efforts to plug in the wings of wisdom for red tourism, and look forward to the increasing prosperity of red tourism in Hunan.
Representatives of the US-China trade talks are rumored to have met in August
Hong Kong's "South China Morning Post" quoted an anonymous source familiar with the matter on the 25th, reporting that Liu He, head of China's trade negotiation team and vice premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the phase one trade agreement between China and the United States.
According to the report, although China has significantly increased the amount of U.S. agricultural products purchased in the past few months, due to factors such as the new coronavirus epidemic, China's purchases are still some way from the amount promised in the trade deal.
Analysts say the recent mutual closures of consulates by the United States and China, along with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade between the two sides.
The phase one trade deal, which came into effect on January 15, stipulates that the trade framework group, which is made up of high-level members of the two sides, should meet semi-annually.
The meeting will be "an important turning point" for both sides to assess progress on the agreement, according to people familiar with the matter.
But the person also said that if U.S.-China tensions lead to low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lai and Liu will meet the terms of the trade deal for semi-annual talks.
Since the beginning of this year, the relationship between China and the United States has deteriorated rapidly, and the disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology.
US President Donald Trump, who boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the deal at the beginning of the year, has recently changed his tune.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of U.S. corn in a single day and bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade deal is not as meaningful to me now as it was when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade talks is unlikely due to poor relations between the United States and China, and that "trade issues have lost their weight in Sino-US relations."
However, he revealed that China's economic and trade units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jiening, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said it was "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, noting that China has made progress this year in further opening up its financial markets to U.S. companies.
Analysts at Plenum, an independent research firm, said: "It's better to talk than not to talk, even though it may just be a routine. ”
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on the 26th that the State Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the State Food and Material Reserves Administration, once again urgently dispatched 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth, 130,000 square meters of geotextiles and other six types of central reserve flood control materials to Anhui to support Anhui's flood fighting, rescue and rescue work.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the "Yangtze River Flood No. 3 in 2020" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, and the risk in some areas has increased.
The meteorological department predicts that there will be heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation will remain severe and complex.
According to reports, since the beginning of the flood season, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed the national comprehensive fire rescue team to pre-set professional rescue forces in key flood control areas, participated in 10,364 flood fighting and rescue rescues, dispatched more than 130,000 commanders and fighters, 17,778 fire trucks, and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people in distress and trapped people, and evacuated and transferred more than 107,000 trapped people.
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to IPO in the United States-Economic Observer-Professional financial news website
Because of the Luckin Coffee fraud incident, the U.S. market has implemented stricter supervision of Chinese concept stocks, coupled with long-term pressure on valuations, Chinese concept stocks listed in the United States are under pressure, and Chinese concept stocks such as NetEase and JD.com have recently started their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, companies such as Shell and Li Auto have been enthusiastic about going public in the United States.
Under the epidemic and the crisis of Chinese concept stocks, is now the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the United States?
"In terms of recent IPO cases and the next companies to go public in the United States, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence, but the market is very good now, and even now this point in time is the best time for Chinese companies to IPO in the United States in the past 10 years. ”
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the "2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit China Concept Stock Branch" hosted by Xueqiu.
In April, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued the Statement on the Importance of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information – A Discussion of Current Access Challenges for U.S. Public Companies with Significant Operations in China.
The statement said that despite the significant increase in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, there are still problems with access to information from U.S. regulators, and the SEC and the PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges.
In addition, in May this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which imposes additional information disclosure requirements on foreign companies listing in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the crisis of Chinese concept stocks has not affected the appetite of investors.
"When this news first came out, everyone panicked, and everyone was asking whether they could go public in the United States in the future, but then we found that these problems are not a problem on the part of investors, and investors may ask these questions during the recent roadshow of IPO in the United States, and even become standardized questions, but this is not regarded by investors as an important factor in whether to invest in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that everyone look at the current situation with a normal heart as much as possible.
Of course, this may seem like the worst situation in the past two years, but in terms of investor appetites, it has not been affected in any way.
So from now until the end of this year or before the U.S. election, the boom in IPOs in the U.S. will continue. ”
On May 9 this year, Kingsoft Cloud was officially listed on the NASDAQ in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to IPO in the United States after the epidemic.
"Kingsoft Cloud's listing gives Chinese companies that are preparing for IPOs very much confidence. ”
Hao Yusheng said.
According to the data report on Chinese concept stocks in the first half of 2020 released by Xueqiu, in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the United States to IPO, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year; From the perspective of the total amount of initial fundraising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion, which rebounded compared with the same period last year, up more than 52.4%; In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the healthcare industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, with an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the quality of Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPO in the first half of this year is relatively high, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming Chinese companies in the United States.
"In the short term, the boom of IPOs in the United States continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and U.S. stocks, and everyone will take the U.S. election and Sino-US relations as a factor in market selection and time selection; in the long term, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations are cycles, both political and economic cycles, and will eventually return to the normal stage, and the stock market has always been volatile. ”
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are many uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary, and investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies." ”

In Yang Yang's calm and composed, the melancholy temperament and grandeur of this work are fully revealed, and the orchestra also interprets Rachmaninoff's "Last Spark" brilliantly.
The pre-performance guided tour of this concert once again brought unexpected surprises to the audience.
CCTV "News Network" anchor Gang Qiang came to the backstage dressing room of the National Centre for the Performing Arts, revealing the "stronghold" of Gergiev, Lang Lang and other music masters before they took the stage, and then he came to the public space on the first floor of the National Centre for the Performing Arts, and had a dialogue with Yang Yang, Zhang Haochen and the tuner of the National Centre for the Performing Arts Yu Kuai in front of three nine-foot pianos with stories. On topics such as the musicians' usual life and pre-performance preparations, at the end of the guided tour, Gangqiang also cooperated with Zhang Haochen in Schumann's "Fantasia", which feasted the eyes of netizens and audiences.

People's Daily Commentator: Concentrate on doing your own thing well and creating new advantages for future development -- On studying and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneur Symposium - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, July 26, commentator's article: Concentrate on doing our own things well and create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic focus, enhancing confidence in victory, and concentrating on doing our own things well are the keys to coping with various risks and challenges.
At the recent symposium of entrepreneurs, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, world economic downturn and shrinking global market, we must concentrate on doing our own thing, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international dual cycles promoting each other, improve the modernization level of the industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the research of key core technologies, and create new advantages for future development.
Those who observe the situation are wise, and those who control the situation win.
In the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the "two ends of the market" and resources have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and backwaves.
An extremely important aspect of making ideological and work preparations to deal with changes in the external environment for a long time and promoting China's economy to ride the wind and waves and achieve steady and far-reaching results is to take the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as the strategic basis of development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development and drive the recovery of the world economy by prospering the domestic economy and smoothing the domestic cycle.
We must profoundly understand that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term peace and stability.
The CPC Central Committee has reviewed the situation and clearly put forward the need to firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, the need to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of China's economy, and the need to meet the people's growing needs for a better life.
The advantage of a large country's economy is that it is internally circulating.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect supporting capacity, more than 100 million market entities and more than 170 million highly educated or professional talents, as well as a super-large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, is in the rapid development stage of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, and has huge potential for investment demand.
The basic socialist economic systems, such as the public ownership system as the mainstay, the common development of the economy under various forms of ownership, the distribution according to work as the mainstay, the coexistence of various distribution methods, and the socialist market economic system, can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop the social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution, and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance of aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international dual cycles promoting each other.
Openness brings progress, while closure inevitably lags behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's door to opening up will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
With the domestic cycle as the main body, it is by no means a closed operation, but by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, the domestic market and the international market are better connected, and the international and domestic markets and resources are better used to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and expanding opening up, and the smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening up, and the more conducive it is to forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is on the rise in the international community, we must stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reform and opening up, strengthen openness and cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the construction of an open world economy, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many hardships in its history, but it has never been crushed, but has become more and more courageous, and has continued to grow and rise from the tribulations.
On the road ahead, with the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the strong mobilization capacity and strong comprehensive strength, and the united struggle of the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the good momentum of China's economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and smoothly start a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way!
Yu'e Bao's income is down, but the "post-90s" are saving money with "revenge"?
With the decline in Yu'e Bao's income, the "post-90s" not only did not flee from Yu'e Bao, but began to save money "with a vengeance"?
According to the "Yu'e Bao Post-90s Money Saving Report" (2020 Edition) recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay, in the first half of the year, the "post-90s" love to save money more: the per capita amount of money saved increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, the "post-90s" are more inclined to start saving from a "small amount of money", and sixty percent of them save an average of less than 20 yuan per transaction...
Saving money with Yue Bao has also become a money-saving habit for the "post-90s".
The data shows that among the 700 million Yu'e Bao users, 134 million users are "post-90s".
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, that is to say, about 3 out of every 4 "post-90s" in the country are using Yu'e Bao to save money.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of money market funds such as Yu Bao has fallen from more than 2% at the beginning of the year to about 1.5%.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of the "post-90s" to save money.
In the context of the improvement of Yu'e Bao's "money-saving effect", many young people who are accustomed to using Yu'e Bao have also been directly transformed into "basic people".
Alipay data shows that as of July 13, the new "basic people" on Alipay have more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have achieved "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from Yu'e Bao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money market funds in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls are more inclined to save more money, with an average of 20% more money than men, and 6 percent of users who hold funds on the Alipay platform are men, and women tend to choose a more stable financial management method than men.
After saving money, what are the plans of the "post-90s"?
Alipay data shows that the "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the most users take travel as the goal of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90s" people have saved money to prepare for post-epidemic travel, and the resumption of cinemas has also provided a new way to shift from saving money to consumption.

Due to contact with an infected PCOO employee, Andanar and 49 PCOO employees were tested for new crown pneumonia on the 24th.
According to a report released on the 25th, 10 of the staff members tested positive.
PCOO Deputy Secretary for Administration and Legal Affairs Marvin Gatpayat said the ministry's new administrative office building in the presidential palace was originally scheduled to resume operations on the 27th, the day President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address.
On the same day, Martin Andanar assured the public that PCOO continues to fulfill its duty to the Filipino people to ensure that important information is provided to the public in a timely manner, while strengthening contact tracing and testing to avoid further spread of the novel coronavirus among PCOO staff, and he prayed for a speedy recovery for those who tested positive.

France increases military investment in space-Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros in space defense budget and develop space military forces to prevent other countries from "unfriendly moves" in outer space.
Parley told Le Provence on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, France's budget for spending on military space programs will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation and communication satellites, launch three electromagnetic surveillance satellites, and modernize its space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a space military command and an "aviation and space force" would be established within the French Air Force.
Parley said the space force would be officially announced later when she visited a military academy in Salon, Provence.
Parley said the space force is part of the Air Force and will have a strength of 500 by 2025.
"Gone are the old ideas that space served the common good of science," she said. Today, space is the arena of struggle for global supremacy. ”
Parley reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that the French side has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is incumbent upon me to fully recognize the threats we may face. ”
Parley recalled the 2017 surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy.
She claimed that the "peeping" was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denied this statement.
Parly said France would "soon" have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and pinpointing "the hands behind those unfriendly moves."
According to the French media, the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is because US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a space force in February last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the creation of the Space Force, the sixth largest branch of the U.S. military.
Some experts are worried that these US moves have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

Chinanews.com, Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan, Zhang Shushan, Xu Jingyi) The Department of Vascular Surgery, Shanghai Changhai Hospital of the Naval Medical University, a famous vascular surgery center in China, signed a contract with the Department of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University on the 25th to jointly set up a collaboration center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of aortic acute and critical disease.
According to Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University, after the vascular surgery department of the two hospitals officially formed a cooperative unit, it will carry out remote consultation, formulate a treatment plan with Changhai Hospital for real-time online consultation, select and send talents for further study and training, and jointly carry out weekly surgical technology exchanges and teaching rounds.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative scientific research on surgery, science popularization and early screening of aortic disease, etc.
A special seminar on the aorta hosted by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and undertaken by Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
At the same time, the two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held a signing ceremony for the Vascular Surgery Collaboration Center, announcing the formation of a cooperative unit to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
The Department of Vascular Surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital is the only vascular surgery institute in the whole army and the only clinical medical center for vascular diseases in Shanghai, as well as the first national key discipline of vascular surgery.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of the Department of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The Department of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first independent discipline of vascular surgery in Fujian Province, which has long been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases, and was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty in 2018.
In the treatment of aortic disease, in addition to the treatment of dissection aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, he has rich experience in emergency ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"The Department of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is very outstanding in the region in terms of the history of development, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation, so we have established a collaborative center this time, in addition to the aorta, we can also carry out all-round in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of lower limb arteries, carotid arteries and other diseases. ”
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of the Department of Vascular Surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
In 2018, Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish the "Li Zhaoshen Famous Doctor Studio" in the Department of Gastroenterology.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of the vascular surgery department of the hospital, said in an interview with a reporter from Chinanews that the vascular surgery department of the hospital has also exchanged relations with Changhai Hospital for a long time, and the two hospitals have officially formed a cooperative unit, which has brought the cooperation and exchanges between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical technical exchanges, teaching ward rounds, and discussion of difficult cases, and at the same time further carry out remote consultations, which are currently planned to be held once a week.
The reporter learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the largest cause of death in China, and the aorta, as the main artery of various organs of the human body, flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic disease is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty of treatment, the thickest part of the aorta is up to 4cm in diameter, once a hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or vascular intima rupture produces dissection, which will cause massive bleeding, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyles and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the world's largest country with hypertension, and the number of aortic diseases has also increased.
Doctors can "re-lane" the blood flow by inserting a stent from the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta to avoid the impact of the aneurysm or ruptured dissection, and some procedures may even require only local anesthesia.
More than 10 domestic experts were invited to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic disease, and to carry out cutting-edge technology training and difficult case discussions in the form of conference salons.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the current treatment of aortic disease continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

Chinanews.com, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the small Three Gorges Tunnel of the Zhengwan high-speed railway, which is about 18.9 kilometers long, was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed rail tunnel with a design speed of 350 km/h in the projects currently under construction in China.
Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is located in Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, connecting Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed railways in the north of Zhengzhou, and reaching Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou.
The small Three Gorges Tunnel of the Zhengwan high-speed railway was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows the breakthrough site.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway starts from Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and goes southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, Xiangyang City, Hubei Province to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City, with a total length of about 818 kilometers and a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the section from Zhengzhou to Xiangyang has been put into operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The small Three Gorges Tunnel, which was completed on the 26th, is a control project of the Zhengwan high-speed railway, which is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County, Chongqing, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and the entire line was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, the person in charge of the design of the Zhengwan high-speed railway tunnel of China Railway Second Institute Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and design party, the terrain and geological conditions of the small Three Gorges Tunnel are very complex, facing the risks of karst, mud inrush, and large deformation of soft rock, and it is a Class I high-risk tunnel, and the tunnel design and construction are extremely difficult.
"During the construction of the project, we adopted geological survey method, geophysical prospecting method and advanced drilling method to advance geological forecasting, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 karst caves of various types. For example, a 24-meter-long bridge was designed and built to cross a large karst cave with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement. Wang Guojun said.
According to the construction party China Railway Tunnel Bureau, during the construction of the tunnel, the combination of dredging and plugging was adopted, through the construction of horizontal tunnel flat guide, grouting and water blocking, strengthening the tunnel structure support and the construction of sewage treatment station, which not only ensured the orderly progress of the project, but also avoided the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Little Three Gorges Scenic Area, and successfully overcame the bad geology such as the large deformation of soft rock up to 7 kilometers long, and the construction problems such as multi-sudden mud water gushing with a maximum daily water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters.
After the completion and opening of the Zhengwan high-speed railway, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport main channel from southwest China to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast China, which is of great significance for improving the capacity and quality of the northeast railway channel in southwest China, improving the layout of regional road network, accelerating the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the line, promoting regional coordinated development, and promoting the implementation of the strategy of western development.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the U.S. Census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives
Several civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have filed lawsuits against the U.S. federal government, arguing that the Trump administration's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress.
Sarah Brannong, executive attorney at the Civil Liberties Union, told VOA, "It doesn't work." ”
She went on to say that Mr. Trump's request to determine the citizenship of those who received the census was difficult to do and "not very reliable." ”
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
A number of cities in New Jersey and Georgia have joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit Friday.
Arlington County Board of Trustees Chairman Garvey said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count every single person who lives in Arlington County and not allow this illegal attempt to scare away and shrink the size of our immigrant community. ”
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
"The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number of residents who are legally resident," he said. ”
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing the U.S. Census Bureau's Commerce Secretary Ross to submit data on undocumented populations from the census so that the administration can exclude those undocumented people from each state's census numbers and determine whether each state will increase or decrease or maintain House seats.
Every 10 years, the United States redistributes seats to the House of Representatives based on demographic changes.
Heavy rain fell in 33 districts and counties in Chongqing, and the local flood control level IV emergency response was launched-Chinanews.com
Chongqing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- This reporter learned from the Chongqing Municipal Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters that Chongqing Municipality has ushered in a new round of heavy rainfall since July 25, with heavy rainfall in 33 districts and counties, and floods at over-alert water levels in four small and medium-sized rivers.
According to the monitoring of Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Station, from 8 o'clock on the 25th to 8 o'clock on the 26th, most areas of Chongqing ushered in heavy to heavy rain, and 33 districts and counties such as Jiangjin, Qijiang, and Wulong experienced heavy rainfall, of which 16 districts and counties such as Wanzhou, Yunyang, and Nanchuan experienced heavy rainfall.
The heaviest daily rainfall occurred in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan, with 197.5 mm.
Affected by heavy rainfall, four small and medium-sized rivers, namely Donkey River in Jiangjin District, Youjiang River in Fuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District, and Tuantan River in Yunyang County, have experienced floods with super-alert water levels, and the water level is still rising.
The heavy rainfall also led to a landslide in Liujing Village, Didi Township, Wulong District, which interrupted the traffic of the village road and road, and the landslide body slipped into the tributary of the Wujiang River along the Canghe River, blocking the river to form a dammed lake.
In response to the heavy rain, the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters issued a river flood level III warning information at 13 o'clock on the 26th, and launched a flood control level IV emergency response, requiring relevant districts, counties and units to strengthen inspections and guards, timely mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials, and evacuate and transfer the people in the threatened areas.
In response to the situation, promote the construction of industrial projects-Hunan Daily-Huasheng Online
In the middle of summer, Hunan is experiencing a heat wave.
The enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting for the promotion of industrial project construction in the province overshadowed the scorching heat of the dog days, and the clear orientation of "comparing strength with industry and discussing heroes with projects" encouraged Sanxiang and Four Waters.
The development of Hunan has always relied on building projects and cultivating industries.
In the face of the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, went all out to fight the two tough battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and took industrial projects as the "first move" to implement the "six stability" and "six guarantees".
From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in GDP in the first quarter to a year-on-year increase of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the difficulties and efforts during the period are self-evident.
On this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and develop steadily and well.
The momentum is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation, not only good at accumulating momentum, accumulating momentum, and seeking momentum, but also good at recognizing, changing, and adapting.
In the context of the current complex and severe international situation, in addition to the hard work of attracting investment, it is also necessary to calm down and study the new characteristics of the current new situation, grasp the law more scientifically, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international dual cycles promoting each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capacity of the industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hope, but also enterprises in traditional advantageous industries accelerated their deployment and implementation in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Aoshikang Third Science Park project has transformed the existing production line, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit boards has seized the opportunity; The new plant of Hunan China Tobacco Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to intelligent transformation and the process of building a modern factory, which is also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprout new sprouts" ... Focusing on the major national strategy and the "two new and one heavy", we should focus on consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively cultivating and developing emerging industries, and comprehensively increasing scientific and technological innovation and domestic substitution, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and accumulate transformation momentum.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economy, new business forms and new models.
In the first half of the year, the province's computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronics and communication equipment manufacturing industry increased by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above designated size increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new opportunities in the crisis, open a new situation in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain and supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the thinking of the industrial chain and grasp the project, it is not only necessary to have the continuous accumulation of leading enterprises and achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain; It is also necessary to concentrate on cultivation in all localities, stimulate the "chain" lock reaction with strong chains, supplement chains and extend chains, promote the coordinated layout of related supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial and supply chains.
To tide over difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot land and a happy land with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All parts of the province have frequently made moves, new moves, and practical moves, in order to "reduce the burden" of enterprise bail-out and promote the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" service, which does not shirk for the enterprise, does not discount the policy fulfillment, and solves the problem overnight...... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "every possible way" were used to identify the shortcomings and pain points, and to achieve a vivid story of turning crises into opportunities.
Focusing on researching the industry, cultivating the industry, developing the industry, and optimizing the business environment in a down-to-earth manner will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the province to grasp the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
At this critical period, we must study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions, effectively respond to external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persistently promote the construction of industrial projects, and work together with enthusiasm and sweat to ensure the successful conclusion of the "13th Five-Year Plan" and the building of a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way.

Cultivating new forms of business and opening up new space for employment-Chinanews.com
New forms of employment are constantly emerging, opening up new space for employment, and a number of innovative service policies have been launched one after another to help new forms of employment thrive.
According to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas nationwide was 5.7 percent in June, down 0.2 percentage points from May.
This is also the second consecutive decline in the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas across the country since April, and behind the month-by-month decline in unemployment rate data is the continuous emergence of new employment opportunities in new business forms.
Now with a salary of more than 5,000 per month, coupled with the freshness of embracing information technology, Guo Mei is becoming more and more motivated.
In the innovation incubation base of Shanxi Transformation and Comprehensive Reform Demonstration Zone, there are more than 2,300 data annotators.
Not only data annotators, since the beginning of this year, the state has also defined 25 occupations such as nucleic acid detectors and online learning service providers as new occupations, developed vocational skill standards, and launched skills training programs to support the development of practitioners.
In view of new employment methods and new entrepreneurial paths, the state is also innovating employment services.
Recently, the National Development and Reform Commission and 13 other departments jointly issued the "Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of New Business Formats and New Models, Activating the Consumer Market and Expanding Employment" to provide workers with diverse employment opportunities.
Multiple departments will jointly cultivate new individuals in the market, further reduce the cost of online entrepreneurship and employment for self-employed people, make new business practitioners more secure, and introduce policies such as the protection of rights and interests of flexible employment and social security.

Employment and prices are generally stable, showing that the economy has a "temperature" - Chinanews.com

Employment and prices are generally stable, showing that the economy has "temperature"
Economic Daily, China Economic Net reporter Lin Huocan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, China coordinated the promotion of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, the epidemic prevention and control situation continued to improve, the steady economic recovery trend was obvious, and the employment and price performance closely related to people's livelihood were generally stable.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate rose.
In particular, in February, the production and business activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of suspension of production, the demand for labor in enterprises decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the order of production and life in the whole society has been continuously restored.
The CPC Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further strengthens macroeconomic policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting enterprises to stabilize jobs and expand employment.
China has increased policy hedging to stabilize jobs, played a combination of "reduction, exemption, and repatriation" policy, reduced or exempted the payment of three social insurance units in stages, allowed to postpone the payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of the policy of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and provided absorption subsidies and internship subsidies for enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various employment stabilization policies, the employment demand of enterprises has rebounded steadily, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas has gradually declined, with the surveyed unemployment rate of 5.7% in June.
Zhang Yi, director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to take effect, and the labor force that withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic in the early stage returned one after another, and the urban labor force participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which was close to the level of the same period last year.
According to the data, total urban employment increased by more than 19% in June compared with February, with most industries reaching pre-pandemic levels, and the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February and slightly 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, a multi-year high.
Entering February, although the year-on-year increase in CPI fell slightly, it was still in the "5 range".
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, which is not only driven by consumer demand before the Spring Festival, but also by the staggered month of the Spring Festival and the low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on prices has been particularly pronounced.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, in January and February, there were logistics delays, untimely supply of materials, and increased transportation costs across the country.
In order to cope with the disruption of the price situation caused by epidemic prevention and control, the relevant departments have included important daily necessities in the scope of emergency transportation to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the effect of a series of policy measures, the supply of vegetables and fruits in the market has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government introduced the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it, the supply of pork reserves was significantly improved, the production capacity of pigs was restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and marketing gradually normalized.
Since March, pork prices have continued to decline, driving the year-on-year increase in food prices to fall to 10.6% in May, and in June, pork prices rose slightly month-on-month due to factors such as the slowdown in pig slaughter, the reduction in imports and the rebound in group consumption demand.
The seasonal variation of fresh vegetable prices was obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high base of comparison in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to decline year-on-year, with an average decrease of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the masses has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, all localities have increased their efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Since March, the CPI has declined month-on-month for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also fallen from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the price level has generally returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, and the overall inflationary pressure is not large, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and life order under the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
We should effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the main producing areas of grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on hoarding, price gouging, and other behaviors that disrupt market order.

Chinanews.com, Qinghai, Hainan, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Lakeside "Flower Sea Live Room": "Sweet" brings goods to help farmers increase income
Author: Hu Guilong, Pan Yujie
"In the middle of summer, Qinghai Lake, full of golden flowers, thousands of bees flying, here the high altitude, large temperature difference between day and night, less air pollution, strong sunlight gives birth to the most tenacious, generous bee colony, created Qinghai royal jelly high activity, high protein, rich in nutritional value, low sugar and low fat characteristics. ”
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live broadcast of bee products was held on the shore of Qinghai Lake, where representatives of China Bee Products Association and entrepreneurs, beekeepers and other parties gathered to jointly promote Qinghai's characteristic bee products, and sold nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau Royal Jelly online and offline, with a total amount of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows beekeepers displaying bee products on site.
It is reported that with the help of Beijing Houdeli bee chain store network, Kuaishou, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail enterprises, live broadcasts, and e-commerce platforms, the live broadcast will promote the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + beekeepers + growers", and continue to issue "Qinghai Plateau Spring Syrup Consumption Coupons" to consumers through online and offline channels, and it is estimated that the total annual profit of the enterprise will be nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, Wu Na, President of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd., believes that "it is very worthwhile": "This move can expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like natural bee products without additives, and drive beekeepers to increase their income." ”
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategic agreement with Qinghai Yunbee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of Qinghai's local bee industry.
The picture shows a sea of rape flowers on the shore of Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road barriers due to epidemic prevention and control, beekeepers have been blocked from chasing flowers and nectar, and many bees have died due to missing the flowering period and lack of food, and the income of beekeepers has been seriously affected.
"Throughout the year, beekeepers travel long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan to the northwest along the way to the northwest with the flowering season.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them. ”
Wu Na said.
"Little bees are 'environmental scouts' and bees can't survive in heavily polluted areas. Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, said that bee pollination is an important part of the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase crop yields and improve quality, especially in areas with extensive planting and poor management conditions.
Research data shows that pollination can increase rapeseed yields by about 15 to 30 percent.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination far outweigh the value of bee products themselves, and the bee industry has great potential for human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological protection, which has been poorly understood. ”
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is getting smaller and smaller, and in addition to beekeepers who are on the go all year round, there are still many poor households with limited mobility who choose to use beehives to join the cooperative.
"The state has financial support, we contact technical personnel to help guide, beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment, to open up sales also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises, and industry associations. ”
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope that everyone will pay more attention to and help the beekeeping community in the future," said Wu Na, "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality, and protect the rights and interests of consumers while helping beekeepers." ”

The old face of spy war drama Liu Yunlong plays a stammering actor-Xinhuanet
Produced by Liu Yunlong, directed by Yin Fei, and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, etc., the large-scale spy war drama "Odds" landed on Guangdong Satellite TV's "Vitality Theater" at 7:30 pm on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), an underground party member of the Communist Party of China lurking in the Japanese puppet police station, and the Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of the Japanese agents and smash the shocking conspiracy of the Japanese army.
"Odds" is based on historical facts, and the material is taken from the Soviet military archives that have been dusty for many years.
During the Battle of Moscow, the elite of the Soviet Red Army in the Far East rushed westward to help, and at this time, the "Northern Advance Faction" of the Japanese Kwantung Army thought that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it and intended to send troops.
In order to relieve the danger of being exposed to the enemy, the CCP and the CPSU intelligence officers jointly implemented the "Mudan Ula" plan.
According to this historical background, the well-known screenwriter Deng Yuan has been polished several times, making the plot twists and turns.
Liu Yunlong served as both the producer and the actor in "Odds" this time.
In the play, he plays Tang Fei, the chief of the Criminal Section of the Linhe Police Department, a stammering policeman who is quite happy and even a little ruffian, and his real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
The heroine Cai Meng, who played against him, is the chief of the Linhe Security Bureau, and is deeply appreciated by the Japanese boss Fukuhara, and there is an ambiguous and delicate relationship between Tang Fei and Tang Fei.
Su Qing has tried many different types of roles in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "We Were Young in Those Years" to Er Qing in "Yanxi Raiders", all of which have left a deep impression on the audience and their acting skills have been recognized.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time, and the setting of the stammering sheriff and the charming policewoman is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two protagonists, there are also many powerful actors such as Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, Shen Junyi and so on in "Odds", and the old drama is also one of the highlights of the play.
It is understood that the production of "Odds" is also very sophisticated, and the crew spanned nearly 2,000 kilometers from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Liaoning provinces to shoot and shoot.
In order to restore the bizarre cityscape during the Japanese occupation period in Northeast China, the crew and art props team worked day and night, carefully polishing every detail of the scene construction and props, so that the scenes in the play are exquisite and rich in historical texture.

Combining the classic Hollywood sports movie story model and the strong cooperation of professional teams from China and Thailand, "PUB" not only presents an international effect, but also will impress different types of audiences.
At the same time, "Jedi Attack" shows a lot of the plot of Muay Thai fighting and training, and the scene is intense and bloody.

In December 2019, Hillhouse Capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over 15% of the equity of Gree Electric Appliances (000651.SZ) with 41.662 billion yuan, and Gree Group retreated as a minority shareholder.
Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland Holdings, said that Greenland's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises in a new stage in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee.

Located in Lanxi City, in the central and western part of Zhejiang, the scenery is beautiful, and there are many scenic spots such as Zhuge Bagua Village, the underground Changhe, and Zhiyan Ancient Village, and more than 200 Shanghai tourists will enjoy these attractions one by one during the two-day and one-night trip.

Am I slapping myself in the face?
U.S. White House advisers "bite back" states to resume work too early-Chinanews.com
White House advisers "bite back" states to resume work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of the global cases.
For months, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states across the country to return to work and school, only recently to change his attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public, while his advisers have "bitten back" that some state governments have resumed work too soon.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kelly Ann Conway said at a press conference that some state governments did not comply with the resumption of work standards and reopened bars and other venues prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that previous claims that the president has "absolute power" to decide on the resumption of work in states were misinformation.
"The president is a federalist who believes that the states have autonomy. ”
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" in Conway's mouth was said by Trump himself at the White House briefing on the epidemic on April 13.
This self-slapping operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history, she's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a shutdown.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold rallies.
This isn't the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out, "It's COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to understand "19" as a version number, and was wildly ridiculed by netizens: read the newspaper if you don't have common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after being compensated for being smashed in the college playground?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, and the children sued the school after receiving compensation
□ Zhao Yifan, correspondent of this newspaper
3-year-old Xiaowen was playing in a college playground when he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen of the softball team while pitching.
After Chen compensated, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground occurred apologize and pay a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and mental damages.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Beijing Haidian District People's Court held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, and had fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen had made compensation, so the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen complained that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground, which was where the softball team was training.
In order to avoid the risks brought by this, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and their parents moved around in the safe area designated by the softball team.
However, Chen, a member of the softball team, later dropped off while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the net into the safety zone and hit the back of the ball.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment, where he was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Man believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not comply with the relevant safety regulations and the team and related facilities are not effectively managed.
The school's negligence led to the above-mentioned incident, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great physical and mental suffering, and also brought great suffering to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground, and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that they must keep a safe distance from the training site and remind them to pay attention to their own safety, and that the plaintiff could not prove that the school had "failed to fulfill its safety and security obligations", so it did not agree to compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the venue where the incident occurred was a venue open to the public free of charge by the university involved in the case, and although the university had a safety guarantee obligation for the management of the playground, such a safety guarantee obligation only required to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school had set up a protective net in the playground, and had fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the compensation agreement reached before, and the two parties agreed to settle the dispute at one time.
Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents again claimed compensation from the school, but there was no basis in law, and the court rejected all of the plaintiff's claims.
After the verdict was pronounced, neither party appealed, and the verdict is now in force.
According to Article 37 of the Tort Liability Law of the People's Republic of China, the school, as the manager of a public place, has the obligation to ensure safety, and if the act of a third party causes damage to others, the third party shall bear the tort liability, and the manager of the public place who fails to fulfill the obligation of safety and security shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
According to the judge, since as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire place, foresee the dangers and damages that may occur, and is therefore most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or mitigate the extent of damages, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the occurrence of damages is the lowest, so the law stipulates that he bears the corresponding obligation to protect his engagement in social activities.
In this case, the school's obligation to ensure the safety of unspecified people entering the playground that is open to the public free of charge should be commensurate with the social activities they are engaged in, specifically, it should mainly take basic safety measures and have the obligation to inform about hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is also not appropriate to impose excessively high security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has already taken measures to set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the manager of a public place such as a school fails to fulfill its safety and security obligations, the liability borne by the manager is a supplement to damages, and according to the newly promulgated Civil Code, the manager can recover from the third party after assuming the supplementary liability.
Therefore, in such an accident, the victim should not expand the scope of compensation after receiving compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for exercise and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in recovery.
Fujian province resumed inter-provincial tourism business from July 21, and Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak of passenger flow on the first weekend after opening.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are many tourists who arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers in the summer, and the airport passenger flow will be dominated by students, tourists, and family visits.
The tourism market is gradually recovering, with an average of 440 flights per day operating at Xiamen Airport in July, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of pre-epidemic levels.
Airlines have encrypted the air shuttle routes from Xiamen to major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming and Xi'an to seize the recovered travel market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a number of summer domestic inter-provincial travel products, and the group itinerary is mainly based on outdoor attractions.
In view of the summer passenger rush at railway stations and airports, relevant units have increased manpower in areas where people are easy to gather such as check-in counters and security channels, and Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Fujian Health Code" to achieve health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promote the orderly recovery of the tourism market.

Israel has strengthened the prevention and control of repeated epidemics-Chinanews.com

Israel has strengthened its prevention and control of repeated epidemics
In the early days of the pandemic, Israel's containment measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli government has taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic many times.
On February 28, the first case of new coronavirus pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, and the military and police jointly maintained prevention and control measures, such as closing all ports of entry and exit, suspending non-essential industries, changing schools to online classes, restricting public transportation and non-essential social activities, locking down cities with severe epidemics, and joint maintenance of prevention and control measures by the military and police.
This series of measures quickly paid off with positive results, and by mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia in Israel had dropped to single digits in a single day.
As the epidemic is under control and Israel's prevention and control measures are fully lifted, the number of new confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia has gradually rebounded since June.
Especially since July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, the number of new daily cases in Israel has exceeded 1,500 for eight days, and as of press time on July 25, the number of new cases on that day reached 916.
As of July 25, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other places of public entertainment, while introducing a policy of restricting public transportation, stipulating that each bus could not have more than 20 passengers.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of a "lockdown" on weekends, stipulating that a "lockdown" will be implemented from 5 p.m. every Friday to 5 p.m. every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but establishments such as shops, shopping malls, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all dates and time slots, gyms, studios and other establishments will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be closed for dine-in, and only takeaway services will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people have not paid enough attention to the severity of the epidemic and have not been able to form a joint force with the government in the fight against the epidemic.
After the resurgence of the epidemic in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government's prevention and control measures affected their economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti-epidemic policies were affecting the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of prevention and control measures such as banning dine-in in restaurants and cafes without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not follow the rules of wearing masks and maintaining a two-meter safe social distance when they are outdoors, and many people only wear masks on their chins or wrists to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks.
According to a recent visit to the kindergarten, the teachers and students in the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying a hidden danger for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Expert Advisory Group on the Fight against the Epidemic at the National Security Council of Israel, believes that Israel is heading towards a "dangerous situation", noting that the current epidemic prevention and control measures in Israel are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic, and that the parliament and government departments should put aside their own interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the fight against the epidemic, and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictions in different sectors.
Tel Aviv, 25 Jul -- Our correspondent in Tel Aviv, Wang Jiong
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't resist his wife Dai Tianfu, and the two of them took a car from their home 20 miles away to the Liangyun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconvenience of his legs and feet in the past two years, the 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still counts on "coming here every other day and getting addicted to tricks".
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City, which is different from ordinary farmhouses, and the courtyard often comes out of the melodious Qin dialect, as well as wonderful shadow puppetry, embroidery works, traditional Qin dialect, eyebrow drama, etc.
The owner of the compound is called Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to plan the construction of a cultural compound with a love for shadow puppetry and singing.
With the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the tune of the Qin dialect had already come out.
Singing excerpts from the Qin dialect for the villagers is Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village.
She has been fond of Qin dialect since she was a child, and now she is well-known in the local area, as long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a live webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see themselves performing. ”
On stage, the singers are one at a glance, and the players are one tune at a time, although they are amateurs, their enthusiasm has not diminished in the slightest.
Just like the rustic style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin dialect, the "grassroots" art and intangible cultural heritage culture in the Liangyun Cultural Compound are coming.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 pieces of farming tools from different eras, traditional and handmade tile sculptures, paper-cutting, embroidery, shadow puppets and other objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which displayed his collection of old objects, such as old wine jugs, three-strings, spinning wheels, etc.
Why did an ordinary peasant build a cultural compound?
"Shadow puppetry is my family craft and I have been learning it since I was 15 years old. ”
Founded in 2012, Liangyun Cultural Compound has become the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia and a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City, among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound, Yanglang Cultural Compound, etc., covering various towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be left behind. ”
"Liu's spy war drama" is back again, and "Odds" looks at Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun's opponents "Drama"-Xinhuanet
The 40-episode spy war drama "Odds" will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
"Odds" is based on real historical facts, based on Soviet military archives that have been dusty for many years and first published.
Liu Yunlong, an actor who is well-known to the audience for "spy war dramas", broke through his image in the play and challenged a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "The Pretender", "Mask" and "Kite" proves that spy war dramas have strong vitality.
Different from previous spy war works, "Odds" looks at the world and extends the background of the story to the battlefield in the Far East of the Soviet Union.
It is set in the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944 and tells the story of Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence officer of the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese underground party and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau, to carry out the "Mudan Ula" strategic operation of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau.
In many spy war dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, is a perfect image of handsome, high IQ, and maturity as soon as he appears.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy, "A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in the pile of people at all, if you appear on the stage, you are the kind of image that is very handsome, I can't wait for everyone to pay attention to you, can you still lurk?" There is a line in "Kite", 'If you don't come to arrest me, I will forget that I am a Kuomintang', and spies will be de-elitist. ”
So in "Odds", Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed the protagonist Tang Fei he played as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "Odds" is supported by the Japanese Fukuhara played by Liang Guanhua and Fang Shibao, the director of the National Police Agency played by Li Liqun.
The two powerful drama bones, one south and one north, have added many highlights to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the word "hurricane" to describe the rivalry between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play, "It is definitely a hurricane, the two of them have a special tacit understanding, and this tacit understanding between them is very impactful to me." A lot of the time their scenes are 'hanging', for example, we only wrote half a page in length, and if I didn't stop filming, they could keep acting. ”
When the actors are in the roles and ensure their own character status, they can not only shape the characters from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience, Yin Fei said that such a scene is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu's spy war drama", and the famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in "Kite" also gathered three in "Odds".
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who have played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again play Tang Fei's right-hand man.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "These two people have no inferior roots, they just went with the flow in that era and that environment." ”
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative to propose, "We want to be humane." This human touch means that there must be good and bad people around me, and the bad people are enemies, but we must also develop them, and our team must also grow. ”
The ending of these two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, and he believed that he would give the audience a satisfactory answer.

Total bank deposits have also continued to increase over the past few months, and there has been a flurry of public offerings in the stock market, with a steady increase in market turnover.
Hui said that the new crown pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's fundamental advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including its geographical location, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and simple and low tax system, have enabled Hong Kong to continue to be a leading international financial centre.
Mr Hui pointed out that the HKSAR Government has earmarked HK$6 billion under the Anti-epidemic Fund to create about 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of FinTech, the HKSAR Government has also launched the "Thousand Talents Scheme" to subsidise local Fintech companies, start-ups and other FinTech-related enterprises to create 1,000 new jobs, employ local talent and enrich Hong Kong's Fintech talent pool.
Looking ahead, Mr Hui expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to capitalise on Hong Kong's advantages and its status as an international financial centre, an international asset and wealth management centre, and a global hub for offshore RMB business to develop and invest in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and beyond.
The Lancet published an article praising China's anti-epidemic efforts and encouraging other countries to learn from their experiences-Chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th saying that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a size similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage, and there has been no large-scale transmission, which has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
In the past decade or so, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health, which has made China's preparedness for the new crown much better than it was for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) back then, the article said.
The authors say that when the SARS outbreak occurred in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially because the pathogen could not be identified.
When the novel coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were quickly able to identify the virus species and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from Chinese mainland and Hong Kong had elucidated the clinical features of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the coronavirus through a research paper published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, which has been carried out very quickly and rigorously through close domestic cooperation amid the declaration of a state of emergency, with the results of progress in early trials of a Chinese-developed COVID vaccine published in The Lancet in May and July, respectively.
China's experience shows that it is important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, have a lot to learn from.
In addition, China's experience has proven that the pandemic can be effectively brought under control by a strong high-level and decisive scientific evidence, based on strong research.
The article stresses that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value, and act on it in the best interests of society.
In the early days of the outbreak, China's National Health Commission sent three teams of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the coronavirus, and their recommendations informed Wuhan's decision to "lock down" Wuhan on January 23.
The article concludes by emphasizing that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

Dapeng director "Auspicious Ruyi" was shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award-Xinhuanet
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Goblet Award.
Director Dapeng's first reality-themed film "Auspicious Ruyi" was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award at this year's Shanghai Film Festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Poster Courtesy of the filmmaker
The film "Auspicious Ruyi" is director Dapeng's first realistic work, and it is also his second relationship with the Golden Goblet Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who has a whim and returns to his hometown in the countryside of Northeast China, hoping to make a literary film about how the family celebrates the New Year, but encounters a series of accidents.
The family members, who had gathered for the filming, completed the final gathering.
In the movie poster released today, Wang Jixiang, a member of the family, sits in the center of the picture smoking a cigarette, with the background of the black land of Northeast China dressed in silver, and the red lantern that Chinese must hang every New Year's festival in the foreground.
The red lantern, which symbolizes joy and reunion, forms a huge contrast with the lonely Wang Jixiang, which seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in the relationship between this big family.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of the "third uncle" Wang Jixiang played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are completed by the real director's family.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "Auspicious Ruyi" originated from "a providence", and a series of sudden changes in the family during the filming made the original shooting plan have to be changed.
How does director Dapeng face this "providence", and how should he continue to welcome the various changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "Auspicious Ruyi" is full of experimental, almost all-amateur lineup and innovative audiovisual style that turns life in front of the camera into a movie, wrapped in real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their family in the family presented in the film, and as the end of this family gathering in the film evokes a series of thoughts.

At the Zhuokang outpost in Balong, platoon commander Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place where the average annual temperature is more than 10 degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands in the mountain pass, and a national flag flutters in the wind not far from the barracks.
The warriors climbed the steep slope of the rubble, using both hands and feet.
It was late July, when flowers flourished at low altitudes, and in Barong Zhuokang, only in the ravine behind the barracks was relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who had been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that this was their back garden, and that the grass could only be seen slowly growing in July and August every year, and soon after, it would all turn yellow and be covered with snow.
Patrolling on foot can take about 9 hours.
In the harsh highland environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all year round, and they regularly patrol the higher mountain passes.
A few days ago, a patrol team composed of 8 soldiers, under the leadership of instructor Liang Yixin, once again embarked on the patrol road.
Each soldier carried a weight of about 30 pounds and marched to the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier was high-back, and his comrades were in emergency ambulance.
In addition to patrol duties, the soldiers at the Barong Zhuokang outpost undergo tactical and physical training on a daily basis.
As the minutes ticked by, the altitude continued to rise, the oxygen levels became lower and lower, and the physical strength was constantly overdrawn, these factors tested the will of the patrol members.
They gritted their teeth and persevered, and successively crossed several landslide points and several dangerous shoals.
At about 16 o'clock, it was lunch time for the patrol members, who took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet, to replenish their strength with food.
Soldiers at the Chok Kang outpost in Barong undergo tactical and physical training.
During the break, they would play cards together, and the loser would do push-ups to entertain and exercise their fitness.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass, and solemnly swore an oath.
Behind them is the snow-capped mountains, and in front of them is a no-man's land of dozens of kilometers, and they are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing's consumption season restarts-Xinhuanet
Beijing has restarted various activities of the Beijing Consumer Season in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization".
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumption coupons were issued, including 1 million offline catering and shopping coupons and 500,000 smart product coupons, which consumers can receive on the JD app.

From the beginning of August, the current 1:1 allocation of government and enterprise funding will be adjusted to 2:1, for example, if consumers can enjoy a discount of 120 yuan after receiving a card package to the store, including 60 yuan of government subsidies and 60 yuan of corporate profits, and 80 yuan of government subsidies and 40 yuan of corporate profits after adjustment.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and 5G new consumption.
Chan Mo-po pointed out that Hong Kong's economy has been hit by the outbreak of the epidemic again, and called on all walks of life to tide over the difficulties together-chinanews.com

On the same day, Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The Bumpy Road to Recovery" on the Internet.
He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Hong Kong has caused a grim situation, which has affected people's livelihood and troubled the economy.
When the epidemic recurs, it is the first priority to strictly prevent imported cases, deal with and interrupt the transmission chain of the virus as quickly as possible, and resume economic activities in a timely manner when the epidemic is under control.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of the epidemic, business transactions and economic activities that had shown signs of recovery have also been hit.
For the business community, social responsibility is equally important in addition to the spirit of contract, especially for those groups that receive large government subsidies under the ESS.
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic conditions in the second quarter of this year were still very severe, but the contraction seemed to slow down slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that Hong Kong's external situation remains severe.
Chan Mo-po said that Hong Kong's development history over the past few decades has shown that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.

"Chinese Doctor" is preparing to shoot a tribute to the anti-epidemic heroes-Xinhuanet
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers for the anti-epidemic heroes, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Film Group, and Liu Weiqiang (left), director of Bona Film Group, had a discussion and exchange with Academician Zhong Nanshan on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctor" in Guangzhou.
Bona Film hopes to use "Chinese Doctor" to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers who are fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a gift film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, under the arrangement and deployment of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Provincial Film Bureau and the Hubei Provincial Film Bureau, Bona Film is organizing the original crew of the film "Chinese Captain" to prepare for the film "Chinese Doctor", which is a film that reflects the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the unity of the people of the whole country to fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on the frontline of Wuhan's fight against the epidemic, with Wuhan medical staff and medical teams from various provinces and cities as the background, from the perspective of human nature, using a unique narrative and a highly impactful lens language, to show the touching stories of Chinese medical workers full of dedication and sacrifice on the front line of the epidemic.
It is understood that as soon as Wuhan was unblocked, Huber&Ranner overcame many difficulties and sent a shooting team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic to communicate face-to-face with hundreds of medical workers to understand and collect information.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also put forward expectations and hopes for the filming of the film in this symposium: "I am looking forward to it, and I hope that you will not only interview some experts who have made more appearances, but also interview more medical personnel who are working the front line, they are the majority. ”
He said that he had watched "My Motherland and Me" and "Chinese Captain" before, and thought that the method of telling the big story from the perspective of ordinary people was very good.
"At present, some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China. ”
When talking about the spread of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus as politicized, and he hopes that the film can move the audience from the perspective of human nature: "In addition to being screened in China, it is best to be shown abroad, and it should be used in a way that can be understood by domestic and foreign audiences, and with a true humanistic spirit." ”
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film "People to Middle Age" in the 80s of the last century, "After so many years, my deepest impression of the film after the reform and opening up is "People to Middle Age", at that time, doctors and friends outside China cried, if "Chinese Doctor" can play such a role, it will be very remarkable. ”
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control, "I believe that people are always smarter than the virus. ”
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, but from the primitive society to the present, human beings have overcome thousands of difficulties and dangers, and now modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures, coupled with the world's medical personnel, and even ordinary people have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new crown pneumonia epidemic, people will no longer be as passive as before, "the next thing to pay attention to is to pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how to strengthen cooperation in the world, and the other is to pay attention to the comfort of people's hearts."

Cultural tourism "red fruit" gathers in Shaoshan - Xiangtan's first Red Expo - Today's news - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily New Hunan Client Reporter Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing red boat mold, Shaoshan Mao Zedong bronze statue, Yan'an cloth pile flower handicrafts, Xiangxi Yongshun bacon ...... On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was launched in the Shaoshan All-for-One Tourism Consultation and Distribution Center.
The exhibition area is full of red cultural and creative products, local products in the old revolutionary area, etc., attracting tourists from all over the world to buy.
"The Red Expo is not only a display of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experience and discuss development paths. ”
According to the relevant person in charge of the Executive Committee of the first Red Expo in Xiangtan, the theme of this Red Expo is "Promoting Red Culture and Boosting Cultural Tourism", with a total exhibition area of nearly 3,000 square meters, and an atmosphere creation area, a scenic display area and a red cultural tourism online game online shopping experience area.

The exhibition area will be on display until July 29.

The cumulative number of confirmed cases of the new crown in Japan exceeds 30,000-Xinhuanet
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and the number of new cases in a single day exceeded 200 for 6 consecutive days, and the cumulative number of cases has reached 11,214.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture, and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
In the first half of the year, the crime of telecommunications network fraud rose by seventy, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate summarized the characteristics-Chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, July 26 According to the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted a total of 58,101 people for fraud, an increase of 35% year-on-year.
In particular, among the crimes of obstructing epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of all crimes that impede epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance, and has released a total of 9 of the 10 batches of typical cases related to epidemic prevention and control, involving the crime of fraud.
Judging from the handling of cases by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many types of fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to the clothing, food, housing and transportation of the people, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical trust" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, deception of state subsidies fraud, national asset unfreezing fraud, etc., constantly "pushing through the old and bringing forth the new", covering education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land requisition and demolition, targeted poverty alleviation, etc. Many fields, such as finance and credit, not only cause economic losses to victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication network frauds break through the restrictions of national borders, regions, and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholders, cross-border, remote, and electronic payments, and there are many unspecified victim groups, and the harm is great.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, use legal network platforms to publicize and recruit, train and assess recruiters, and adopt enterprise operation mode management, wearing a "legal coat", which is more confusing.
It is the bounden duty of the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to promptly issue early warnings to the public and relevant departments.
In the judicial handling of cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure posture against fraud crimes, but also detailing various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance through the formulation and issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures, and application of law in fraud cases of arrest and prosecution, and take the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, so as to ensure that nothing is done in vain.
In particular, for telecommunications network fraud crimes, pay attention to the central role of electronic data in the determination of facts, and strive to build an evidence chain that corroborates electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, in the case of epidemic-related fraud handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorate intervened in advance as soon as possible, and it took only 5 days from the occurrence of the case to the conclusion of the case, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and maintain the overall stability of the society.
In the process of reviewing arrests and examining for prosecution, attention was paid to the prosecution of omitted offenders in cases, correcting the omissions of 733 arrests by the public security organs, and correcting the omissions of the public security organs to review and prosecute 1,113 co-defendants.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications networks discovered in the handling of cases, the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate and the Dongguan Municipal Procuratorate of Guangdong Province promptly put forward procuratorial suggestions, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the construction of long-term systems.
Fourth, we should make every effort to do a good job in recovering stolen goods and recovering losses.
Procuratorial organs in all localities have grasped important links such as intervening in the investigation, guiding the collection of evidence, and reviewing for prosecution, urging the investigating organs to actively recover stolen money, cooperating with relevant departments to do a good job of recovering stolen goods and recovering losses, and striving to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud to the people.
For example, in the case of Lin Moumou's routine loan handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate, which involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed, under the circumstance that the real estate may be disposed of in advance by other cases, it was the first to formulate and issue a "Letter of Suspension of Enforcement" and send it to the relevant court in a timely manner, suggesting that the court that had previously sealed the property should suspend the execution of the real estate involved in the case, and deal with it uniformly after the facts of the crime were clarified, so as to make the greatest efforts to recover the real estate involved in the case and recover the victim's losses.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against fraud crimes, not to expect "pie in the sky", and not to be gullible if they think it is cheap, and to guard their "money bags".
Huana Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: The dwarf apple tree widens the road to poverty alleviation-Chinanews.com
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the scorching heat, a reporter from the Economic Daily-China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Huana Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong was hoeing grass in the base, although his face was flushed, but his mouth hummed a few small songs from time to time.
Weining County, where the town is located, has a certain reputation in the surrounding areas because of its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient sunlight, large temperature difference between day and night, high sugar content and good taste, but it has not been able to sell at a good price and has not been able to form an industrial scale because of its small size and many spots.
The town used to be a poor township with "spring and autumn potatoes", and the local poverty incidence rate was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
In the critical period when poverty alleviation has entered a decisive battle, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase farmers' income.
After many visits, Chen Chao, Secretary of the Party Committee of Huana Town, and a group of people in the town believe that industrial development can no longer take the old road.
To this end, the town of Rina has introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Huana Town from Shaanxi in 2015 to investigate, and immediately took a fancy to the local planting conditions, and began to plant apple trees in the local area in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees, and Li Yuanzhong and his wife muttered in their hearts: "I have planted apples for so many years, and I haven't seen anyone in the village who has made a fortune by planting apples." ”
"The apples that are planted are dwarfed, so they don't make the tree grow too tall. ”
What Li Yuanzhong didn't expect was that a new method was adopted for apple planting this time, the irrigation pipe was laid under each apple tree, and the water and fertilizer were poured to the roots of the tree.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered the bumper production period, and the market is as Hou Jianwen expected, apples are not worried about selling, and are deeply loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life, although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee every year, there are profit dividends after hanging the fruit, the couple usually work in the base, "one person can get 80 yuan a day, and there is work all year round."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividends were more than 2,800 yuan, plus land transfer fees and the couple's labor income, the family's income was more than 80,000 yuan.
"At present, the initial results have been achieved, and the annual output value of 1 mu of apples is more than 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn. ”
Chen Chao told reporters that 20,000 acres of apples have been planted in the town, 6,000 acres in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 farmers and 17,200 people, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people, and more than 6 million yuan in wages a year.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets were bulging day by day, also began to realize his "wish".
During the Lunar New Year this year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle and drove a car to and from work every day, "There are still more than a dozen acres of land at home, and when the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base, all of them will be transferred to them, and the income will be more." ”

Membrane separation technology helps solve the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of a novel hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology
Recently, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University has made significant progress in the "membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide", and successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, which greatly improves the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The results have been published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit of the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and use carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of scientists.
"Membrane separation" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving, and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "breathe deeply" and improve the gas separation efficiency is the bottleneck and difficulty of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation method.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University innovated ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on the separation performance of membrane gas through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that the carbon nanotubes in the membrane material are more uniformly distributed and "more breathable" by using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the hybrid matrix membranes prepared by this new technology is close to the upper limit of the current theoretical separation of such membrane materials.
"The new technology provides a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation. ”
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team at Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for the treatment of flue gas in coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in the future, and play a significant role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions. ”
Before volunteering to fill in, first understand what is the professional grade difference-Chinanews.com
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning Post Author: Yu Xiao Editor: Yu Xiao
Before volunteering, understand what is the professional grade
Every year, students or parents fill in the college entrance examination because they do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary application, which in turn affects the voluntary application.
This year, five universities, Beijing Jiaotong University, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology, jointly released the 2020 enrollment policy to cancel the professional grade difference.
What does professional grade mean and what is the significance of volunteering?
There are three ways to assign rules
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteers, you must read the "Enrollment Regulations" of your favorite school carefully to understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the proportion of file adjustment, major allocation rules, etc.
The major allocation rules refer to the three main ways of admitting majors: major priority, score priority, and major grade difference after colleges and universities adjust their files.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be clarified in the Enrollment Regulations.
However, there are also some colleges and universities where the admission principle is that the total score is preferred, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, the candidates within the admission range will be lined up according to the total score, and when the score does not reach the admission score line of the first professional choice, it will be seen whether the admission score line of the second professional choice is reached, and so on until the last professional choice is admitted, and there is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" means that when the college arranges the candidates' majors, they determine the admission majors of the candidates who choose to apply for different majors according to one or several score values announced in the enrollment regulations, and this kind of score value is the "professional grade difference".
That is, the difference between the scores of the first professional and non-first professional preferences of the candidates, and the score difference between the professional preferences, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example:
Suppose that student Xiao Ming applied for college A and scored 560 points, and his professional preferences were: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, and e-commerce, and the professional admission of college A implements the method of professional grade difference, and the grade difference is 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, and 0 points.
If he is not admitted to Computer Science, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, and the candidates who apply for "International Trade" will be ranked according to the score of 558 to determine whether they meet the admission requirements of the major; if they still cannot meet the requirements, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e., 557 points) for the third professional choice If they still can't meet the requirements, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e., 556 points) for admission to the fourth major, and if the subsequent majors still can't meet their professional aspirations, the points will not be deducted, and so on.
Different universities have different professional grade differences
With the popularity of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now canceled the professional grade difference, but this year there are still some colleges and universities still retain this method, from the "Enrollment Regulations" published by each school, this year there are more than 20 universities set up the professional grade difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, Civil Aviation Flight University of China, etc.
Within these universities, each university has a different level of specialization.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University, and candidates whose files have been submitted to the school will be admitted according to the order in which the candidates fill in their professional preferences by 1 point and then sorted by score.
However, some universities set different professional grade differences between different majors.
For example, in Jimei University, the total score difference of professional volunteers is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points, and there is no grade difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteers, and the professional grade difference between other professional volunteers and adjustment professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling in the volunteers, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school they are applying for, to see if there is a professional grade difference, what is the form of the grade difference, while fully considering the scores, but also to reasonably analyze the school and major to be selected, if the institution in the enrollment regulations clearly adopt the score difference method for admission, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing a major, and improve the admission chance.

Chengdu people gathered around the U.S. Consulate, and the police stopped people from "looking too happy"
In response to the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston by the United States, China announced the closure of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the U.S. consulate's badge was removed, and on Sunday, a car with dark glass drove away amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many Chengdu people gathered in front of the U.S. Consulate to take pictures, and those who had not been there also came to take a look because of their curiosity about current affairs.
A reporter from the Chengdu station of AFP also went to the vicinity of the US Consulate in Chengdu to observe, and sent back news that there was an endless stream of curious people, and many parents brought their children to take a walk to see the consulate, take pictures of the building, or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, who occasionally "corrected" people's behavior, and they seemed to not allow anything out of the ordinary: a woman was stopped just about to sing a red song, and another confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building managed to pull up a giant Chinese flag on their balconies and shout slogans in support of China.
The U.S. Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985 and covers all U.S. consular related matters in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
Agence France-Presse Chengdu reporter said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: many Chinese asked the government to close the US consulate in Hong Kong online, but the official only said that "the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States."
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong.
Large-scale financial media action "Go to the village to see poverty alleviation" set off - Today's News - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, New Hunan Client, July 25 (Reporter of this newspaper) On July 25, the large-scale financial media action "Go to the Village to See Poverty Alleviation" sponsored by the Financial Program Center of China Central Radio and Television set off from Xuzhou, Jiangsu, and two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting systems slowly drove out of the scene under the eyes of the guests.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a milestone year, we will build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, achieve the first centenary goal, and 2020 is also a decisive year for poverty alleviation."
The large-scale financial media action "Go to the Village to Watch Poverty Alleviation Live" is an important measure of the Financial Program Center of China Central Radio and Television to cooperate with this major theme and do a good job in poverty alleviation publicity.
The action will go into poverty alleviation villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government, excavate fresh stories of poverty alleviation, directly hit the great changes in the appearance of the villages, and show how the villagers can break through the difficulties of survival and development and move towards the road to prosperity.
The operation will last more than 3 months.
The reporter set out from Xuzhou, divided into two routes, all the way to the southwest line, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places; The other route takes the northwest route, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, with a journey of more than 10,000 kilometers.
In terms of reporting form, "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through the CCTV Financial Channel of China Central Radio and Television, the Voice of the Economy of CCTV, China Traffic Broadcasting, and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be mainly completed in the noon news program "Tianxia Finance" on the CCTV financial channel (premiere time: 12:00-13:00 from Monday to Sunday), and the prime time news column "Economic Information Network" of the CCTV financial channel will open a poverty alleviation report column (premiere time: 20:30-21:30 from Monday to Sunday).
At the same time, the caravan will conduct a live broadcast of up to 1 hour on the CCTV financial client for each village it visits, and the audience can watch the live broadcast and participate in the lottery by downloading the CCTV financial APP.
In terms of technology application and studio design, "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" has the courage to make a breakthrough and create the first "new media caravan in the field".
The car is equipped with a 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system, using 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to achieve the organic combination of online and offline, large and small screens, and TV broadcasting.
Equipped with three broadcast area, the studio area is modified from a container, 12 meters long, 2.55 meters wide, 3.98 meters high, the box adopts a hydraulic automatic deployment structure, and the maximum can be turned up to 120 degrees.
The studio area can also be automatically expanded, and the external expansion platform is connected, with an area of more than 50 square meters, which can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, it is already a hot summer in Dongchuan District, Kunming City, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation and resettlement site.
Lv Ling, an employee of Kunming Aisfu Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., said, "Now, as soon as I leave home, I enter the factory door and make money to take care of my family, thanks to the free vocational skills training organized by the trade union." ”
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop of electronic component processing in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture of enthusiasm came into view.
Lu Ling, who is in her 40s, is a single mother who takes care of her children alone and takes care of her elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas and find a way, and "sent charcoal in the snow" after running.
Since 2018, Lu Ling has enjoyed housing, schooling, social security, employment and other assistance policies and assistance funds issued by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her children have successfully graduated and are employed, and she herself has a job and income after participating in skills training, and she was released from poverty at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project organized by the Dongchuan District General Organization to help poverty alleviation is part of the skills training work of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
Combined with the characteristics of the difficult workers in the ex-situ poverty alleviation and resettlement sites in the district, the district general manager conducted an in-depth investigation to understand the training needs, determined the type of training work, and planned to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, pastry chefs, etc. in the near future.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Menglian County Branch of the Agricultural Bank of Yunnan Province, wrote a sincere letter of thanks to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In the letter, she sincerely thanked the union for giving her the Golden Autumn Bursary from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the file of difficult employees.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of poverty through institutional guarantees and targeted assistance.
The success of Lu Ling's family and Li Yi in extricating themselves from difficulties is a microcosm of the Yunnan trade unions' efforts to promote the work of extricating workers from difficulties.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Rights Protection Department of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions has strengthened the dynamic management of the files of employees in difficulty, promoted the normalization of the filing work, and included the difficult employees who meet the filing conditions into the assistance system in a timely manner.
During the epidemic period, in order to help the employees in difficulty to relieve the pressure of life, Yunnan Province has arranged a total of more than 1,300 yuan to send warmth funds, in accordance with the national level of 2,000 yuan per household of difficult workers in the file and 1,500 yuan per household of provincial difficult workers in the file, more than 6,000 national and more than 1,000 provincial difficult workers in the file to implement special warm condolences activities.
At the same time, the provincial general manager connects with various Internet recruitment platforms such as the human resources and social security departments and Zhaopin, pushes recruitment information to employees in difficulty, and provides employment consultation, employment guidance and other services.
