DESCRIPTION C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both use one or more of the four steps to process input files: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The source file's post-name identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the postupy controls the default setting:
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c file, and to set the connection in the form of c,
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C++ file and to set the connection in the form of C++.
The post-name of the source file indicates the language type and the later operation:
.c C Source program; preprocessing, compilation, compilation
.C++ source program; pre-processing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source program; pre-processing, compilation, assembly
. CXX C++ Source Program; Preprocessing, Compilation, Compilation
.m Objective-C Source Program; Preprocessing, Compiling, Compiling
.i Preprocessed c file; compilation, compilation
.ii Preprocessed C++ file; compilation, assembly
.s Compilation language source program; Compilation
Compilation language source programs; preprocessing, compilation
.h preprocessor file; files that do not normally appear on the command line with other later names are passed to the connector (Linker).
.0 Object file (object file)
.a Archive file (archive file)
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options (or compilation errors prevent the full process) are used, the connection is always the final step.
During the connection phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, unrecognized file names (including specified .o H mark files and .a library files) are passed to the Connector Options (OPTIONS) in the order of the command line
The option must be given separately : de' is completely different from `-d -r'.
Most `-=E : and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Here are only the formats that are not the default options.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, interpreted in the following section.
Code Generation Option (Code Generation Option)
The overall option (overall option)
Make it clear that the language in which the file is entered later is language (instead of the default choice from the file name).
This option applies to all the input files that follow until the next `-x' option is encountered.
Close any clear statement of language, so the RE AS E `-x' option is processed later by the file name).
If you only operate a part of the four stages (preprocessed, compiled, compiled, connected), you can use the `-x' option (or after the file name Ah) to tell geo where to start, tell geo where to end with the `~-c' ,`-s', or `-E' option. Note that some combinations of options (such as `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI default case, GCC can use the .o' .o' source file name to change the post-level `.ec tag file name. You can use the -o option to select another name.GCC Ignore -ec option after any unrecognized input to Wenbo -S F What's wrong.
The target document.
After compilation, stop, do not assemble.
The assembly of those systems does not read data from the pipeline because the assembly of those systems does not have this problem, and the assembler can accept the C "dialect": C programs that support ANSI standards.
This shuts down some of the incompatible ANSI Cc feature keywords in GNU Cc, as well as features such as Unix and vax that indicate that the ANSI trigraph features are rarely used, and that all standard libraries available under the host environment, the main function returns an int value, a typical example of which is almost all programs except the kernel.
For function declarations that have no parameters, such as `int foo();', it is handled in C style -- that is, no number of parameters or types are stated. (for C++ only).
Normally, such a function foo means that the argument is empty in C++.
The section list is removed from here to some aspects of trying to support the traditional C compiler.
For more information, see the NU c manual, we have removed the details so that when the content is out of date, people will not be HERI.
Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option brings an additional effect that allows for this assignment.
He is the same as the result of the "-Ethis-is-variable" option.
Traditional-cpp tries to support some aspects of traditional Cc preprocessors.
In particular, the above mentions the content of the preprocessor, but does not include other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allow the use of `$' characters in the identifier (for C++ only).
You can specify the "-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers" option to manifestly prohibit the use of the `$' term.
(GNU C++ is allowed `$' by default in some target systems, but not all systems.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion (MEF c++) of type ant to enumeration.
Normally GNU C++ allows conversions from enum to int, but not on the other hand.
-fexternal --templates generate smaller code for template declaration (c++ only) by generating a copy for each template function, only where they are defined.
To use this option successfully, you must, in all files that use the template, mark `#pragma implementatio' (defined) or `#Pragma interface' (declared).
When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', the template instantiation is all external types. You have to let the required instance appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved with typedef, which he references every instance required.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-exteznal-templates' is used at compile time, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except constructor functions and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class.
This does not mean that each call to a member function will pass through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; then it can be called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the type of the second and third parameters of the conditional expression to be mismatched.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-is-variable that allows the assignment of this (only for c++).
Merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism to c++ makes the assignmentable `this' seem out of place.
Therefore, by default, the assignment of this within the class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation effective with the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.
Various machines have their own default char type. It may be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, when relying on the symbolic nature of the data, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz.
But many programs have been written to use only simple char, and the period street is a signed number (or unsigned number, depending on the target machine that wrote the program).
This option, and its antonymous option, makes that program work on the corresponding default value.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If there are no explicitly declared `signed' or "unsigned" modifiers, these options are used to define the bitfield or unsigned bitfield.
In default, the bit field is symbolic, because the basic integer type they inherit, such as int, is a symbol number, however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, the bit field is always an unsigned number.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants into writing data segments without special treatment.
This is to be compatible with some old programs, and they calculate that changing string constants is a very bad idea, and the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive summary
The Impact of New Coronary Pneumonia on the Drug Market
The impact could be similar to the 2008 economic crisis.
The global coronavirus outbreak has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has impoverished health services and has almost collapsed, and the restrictive measures imposed by Governments have caused serious disturbances in the global economy.
For the drug market, the impact of the epidemic is not clear and difficult to predict, but it may have a far-reaching impact.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement while also limiting access to precursors and basic chemicals.
Traffickers are unable to cross the border due to travel restrictions and may have to find new routes and methods.
The patterns of drug use and delivery may change, and the government’s ability to respond may be hampered.
The transformation brought about by the new crown pneumonia is unprecedented, but some lessons can be learned from previous crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances, using a pattern of diversion to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut their drug-related budgets.
If governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, interventions such as drug use prevention and related risk behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard.
In addition, the prioritization of interdiction operations and international cooperation may be reduced, making traffickers more mobile-friendly.
In some countries, a large amount of drugs are smuggled through commercial flights, and drug trafficking in those countries is expected to be the most directly affected.
There are messengers who put synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or hidden in private baggage, sometimes in large numbers. As restrictions on air passenger traffic have been imposed almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely interrupted.
While the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, trafficking in the use of dark web and cargo mail is likely to increase.
In the long run, recessions and associated closures could disrupt the drug market.
Due to rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug abuse, and turn to drug-related illegal activities, whether productive or transportable.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation by providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to grow their ranks.
As government coping capacity diminishes, these shifts could quickly take root and become a new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
Market growth
Population growth patterns partly explain why the market is expanding
Drug abuse has been increasing around the world, both in terms of the overall figure and in terms of the proportion of drug users in the world population.
In 2009, there were an estimated 210 million drug users, or 4.8 per cent of the global population aged 15-64, compared with an estimated 269 million in 2018, or 5.3 per cent of the population.
Over the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.
This partly reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with 7 per cent in developed countries and 28 per cent in developing countries but also reflecting the rapid growth of young populations in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.
During the period 2000-2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.
Urbanization is a driver of the current and future drug market
In both developed and developing countries, there are more drug abuse cases in urban areas than in rural areas.
The overall increase in drug use is due in part to the large-scale rural-to-urban movement of the population, which currently accounts for more than half of the world ' s population living in urban areas, compared to 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more prominent.
The increase in wealth is linked to an increase in drug abuse, but the burden of disease is greatest among the poorest worldwide, with drug use more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are more strongly linked to the world’s wealthier regions.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use among the wealthy segments of society is high.
However, the higher rates of drug abuse are among those with lower socio-economic status.
Data from a few countries indicate a link between harmful drug use patterns and morbidity and low incomes.
These patterns seem less common in the wealthier social classes.
The economic constraints caused by the global coronavirus crisis are likely to increase the risk to the most vulnerable, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked to an increase in drug use in the past, and the epidemic has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide to lose their jobs.
The pandemic of new crown pneumonia, which could lead to further expansion of the drug market, could lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because of lower controls by national authorities or because more people might have to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the event of an economic crisis.
Restrictions on the new coronavirus have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, which may have increased by sea trafficking, a low risk of interception at sea and a greater number of traffic by air or land.
There have been recent reports of cocaine shipments to Europe directly from South America by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but the potentially harmful new opioids are increasing the drug market.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs has also increased rapidly.
There are about 500 new active substances in the domestic market of Member States each year.
Most of these are currently stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agongists and small amounts of opioids.
Although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, only 2% of new psychoactive substances were opioids, but by 2018, this number had risen to 9%.
Many of the new psychoactive substances of opioids are fentanyl analogs whose efficacy and harms have been demonstrated, leading to overdose deaths in North America, as well as in other regions, but to a lesser extent.
In North America, fentanyl is used as an doping agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, and some for the manufacture of counterfeit medicinal opioids.
Some evidence suggests that there are also new psychoactive substance stimulants in Europe: a study of waste syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes have new psychoactive substances that have an excitable effect.
The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly present in vulnerable groups.
A single type of new psychoactive substance almost never forms a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, and most of them identified synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals has forced drug manufacturers to innovate many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and “ecstasy” have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and drug makers have been looking for alternatives to substances that are not only less controlled, but also chemicals specifically designed for circumvention of controls, the so-called “special precursors”.
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of new crown pneumonia are likely to further squeeze those who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia was reported to have contributed to higher methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly.
Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiet market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opiates intercepted by the Russian Federation authorities has dropped by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for the use of opioids has decreased significantly.
But the doping market seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various types of cathidone, including mephedrone and a-pyridoxyphenylpentone, are now ubiquitous in the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported a sharp rise in the number of clandestine laboratories seized to manufacture various illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years and increasing to 152 processing points in 2018.
Growth in the Methamphetamine Market in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, investigations of people in hospitals, prisons and other institutions revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystallized methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern outside of Fenitarin and Tromado.
The findings were further confirmed by a 2015 study, in which drug users said marijuana was more difficult to obtain than “fentaline” or methamphetamine.
Recently, several methamphetamine processing points have been discovered by the Iraqi authorities, and the Board has expressed concern about the large number of imports of pseudo-ephedrine preparations at the Methamphetamine processing point for the use of these formulations as precursors.
In Afghanistan, the manufacture of methamphetamine appears to have begun in 2014.
Seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing since then.
However, seizures in the first half of 2019 amounted to ^657 kg – a sharp increase compared to the previous year.
The large seizures of methamphetamine, which are believed to be derived from Afghanistan, in other countries, also indicate that production in the country is rising rapidly.
Policy changes and trends
Most of the jurisdictions where non-medical use legalizes cannabis use increase in cannabis use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that do not legalize non-medical use.
In the two states that first passed legislation in the United States, Colorado and Washington, the increase in non-medical use of marijuana by adults, especially over the past month and daily or near-daily use, has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show an increase in cannabis use in Uruguay since 2011, with the use of almost doubled last month.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is frequent and frequent use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also shows that the expansion of the legal market between 2018 and 2019 is also increasing.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still had access to certain products from illegal sources.
The reason behind the global cannabis herb seizure collapse is the legalization of cannabis.
Global seizures of cannabis herb fell to their lowest level in 20 years in 2018, as seizures in North America declined by 84 percent over the past decade.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world had almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures showed that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect on the domestic regulatory effect on new psychoactive substances is still difficult to assess.
Some countries that have adopted different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances have shown different prevalence of new psychoactive substances.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased following the adoption of domestic legislation.
The availability of painkillers in high-income countries is unevenly distributed in high-income countries, where vulnerable groups face harm from the legal and illicit drug markets.
In 2018, more than 90 percent of all medically available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50 percent are in North America, 40 percent in Europe, and 2 percent in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12 per cent of the global population.
It is estimated that the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88 per cent of the global population, but consumes less than 10 per cent of medicinal opioids.
Obstacles to access to pharmacopiadis are linked to a number of factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescribing practices.
In 2018, some 35.6 million people were at greater risk of drug use in 2018.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use and exacerbate its consequences. This has been confirmed by research in high-income countries, where the unfavorable socio-economic trajectory of individuals is not only related to their situation at a given point in time, but also with the risk of drug use.
Drug abuse can also deepen socio-economic disadvantages and further increase the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby fuelling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be linked to abusive attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, groups of diverse sexual orientations, persons displaced by armed conflict or disasters, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug abuse or problems with access to treatment services.
Based on the disability-adjusted life-of-life (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, the social impact of harmful drug use has increased over the past 10 years on a wider range of society.
Between 2007 and 2018, the number of disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17%.
The number of years of disability-adjusted life expectancy associated with liver cancer associated with untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, has increased particularly high – to 40 per cent.
The intricacies of the relationship between drugs and violence make it difficult to determine all causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited data on a global scale suggest that intoxication can be an important factor in killing.
But in the violence, alcohol seems to be more effective than drugs.
While drug use can lead to crime, in some cases, this link can be attributed in part to multiple intermediaries, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family circumstances, and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, is likely to be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends not so much on the number of traffickings as on certain changes that have created an unstable balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known offenders, and enforcement measures that make one group weaker than the other.
Latest trends
Cannabis use is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most harmful.
It is estimated that 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.
By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
But the opioid-related harms are overlooked because users are less likely to do so.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use in 2017, 66 percent were caused by such substances, and 50 percent of the 21 million years of life expectancy believed to be due to disability or premature death from drug use.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Trumado; in North America it is fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economy, demographics, or drug-use patterns in general, but are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in the number of opioid overdose deaths over 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results, although the numbers were lower.
Part of the reason fentanyl causes overdose deaths is that the efficacy of fentanyl in the illicit drug market is unpredictable.
In West, Central Africa and North Africa, the market for non-medical uses has increased significantly.
In the region, more and more people are treated with the condition of tramado.
In 2017, the number of tramados intercepted worldwide increased significantly, peaking at more than 125 tons.
But in 2018, global seizures fell to 32 tonnes after India passed a new law regulating tramado.
The crisis was caused by simple manufacturing and low production costs, as well as a lack of international regulation of Tomado and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
What exacerbates these crises is that these substances are available in both the drug market and on the illicit market, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their misuse.
Increasing use of stimulants
Cocaine and methamphetamine are mainly used in the stimulant field, both of which are on the rise in their main markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018 because it is popular in North America and Western Europe.
About 27 million people used amphetamine in the same year, of which methamphetamine was the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
Based on most of the indicators available, the use of methamphetamine in both regions has been expanding over the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist and sometimes replace each other, and the use of another drug decreases when the use of such a drug rises, and sometimes increases and decreases at the same time to meet the needs of the same market.
New Coronary Pneumonia Increases Risk of Injecting Drug Users
It is estimated that about 11.3 million people were injected with drug use in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people are infected with HIV by injecting drug users and 5.5 million with hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died of drug use, half of them from hepatitis C-induced liver disease, while most people who injected drug users had not received treatment for hepatitis C.
The opioid shortage caused by the new coronavirus restriction measures may cause the user to replace it with an easier-to-reach substance such as alcohol or benzodiazene, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injections or more frequently, more harmful use may occur.

EU summit debate over refugee policy, EU officials: step-by-step bottlenecks in reception process
EU summit squabbles over refugee policy, EU officials: There are bottlenecks in every step of the process
According to Agence France-Presse reported on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration, so as to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The EU’s move is reportedly a response to Europe’s growing focus on illegal immigration, and the core problem for the EU today is the small number of illegal immigrants who can eventually be deported.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to “immediately mobilize large amounts of EU funds” to strengthen external borders through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and member states have been squabbling over issues such as the payment of fencing fees.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not pay the related fees.
But diplomats in some member states say that if the EU can share the installation of cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along the external border, it will free up national budgets to speed up the construction process.
EU officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks in every step of the refugee reception process, limited reception capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states cannot prevent refugees from filing “innumerable” asylum claims in EU countries, and that the EU’s refugee reception system is in a near-permanent crisis.
The European Commission estimates that the EU’s Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half over the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also reached an agreement on a “principle” to send illegal immigrants back to their home countries under a court decision of another member state.
EU leaders have also agreed to “increase the use of the concept of a safe country,” which would open the way for the EU to draw up a common list.

U.S. upgrade "chip war" hits global semiconductor industry
Recently, the United States has a great escalation of the "chip war" against China - first, the Netherlands, Japan and the United States under pressure, agreed to start the control of semiconductor manufacturing equipment exports to China; later foreign media reports, the U.S. government is considering cutting all ties between U.S. suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting U.S. suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also ready to publish an executive order to limit U.S. investment in the sensitive Chinese technology industry.
In recent years, the United States' action to crack down on China's "core" development has never stopped, while accurately suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain to China, while building a "de-Sinicization" semiconductor industry chain alliance, in an attempt to "slang out" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to win the establishment of a "technical alliance" between South Korea, or with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a "four-way alliance" of chips, or through the United States, Japan, India and Australia, "Indo-Pacific economic framework" and other mechanisms to establish a semiconductor industry chain "small circle", the United States through the politicization, campification, weaponization means into the semiconductor industry, trying to build a closed production chain cycle led by the United States, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing, to maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the United States' fanfare "core tactics" against China are also "injuring the enemy by a thousand self-inflicted 800."
Recently, the United States well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier Panlin Group announced that due to the impact of the latest round of chip manufacturing equipment export ban, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees, the next two quarters also plan to lay off 1,400 temporary employees.
Asmai Holdings, a global lithography machine giant in the Netherlands, recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.
U.S. media analysis, after the U.S. government imposed a trumpeted crackdown on China's chips and semiconductor industries, many U.S. companies suffered from it, including electronic design automation tools developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves and so on.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has long formed a globally connected semiconductor industry chain.
According to professional estimates, based on the professional division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the borders of each country more than 70 times, the whole process reaches 100 days.
Although the U.S. semiconductor industry has a strong base, it is weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially advanced process processes, and is heavily dependent on East Asia.
Even if the United States tries to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the development of the "small circle" regionalization led by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of global semiconductor-related industries is difficult to change.
The United States has strongly "reshaped" and "de-Sinicized" the semiconductor industry chain, which has hit the global semiconductor industry hard.
Chip is the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of all countries in the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introduced the "Innovation and Competition Act", "2022 American Competition Act" and "Chips and Science Act", using scientific and technological hegemony to consolidate the country's technological leading edge; "enwaying" to allies, enticing Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturing companies to set up factories in the United States, and trying to ensure the global leadership of the United States in the field of chips.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created trouble for China's chip industry and related industries, and reaped real benefits.
But in the long run, the United States hysterically suppressed, forcing China's chip industry to continue to break through, so that they lost the huge Chinese market, will eventually greatly weaken the willingness of American technology companies to innovate and innovation ability, damage the global chip industry development.

The first batch of personal pension products on sale

Fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust
Another big gym "thunderstorm"?
Recently, the rights protection of well-known fitness institutions in Zhongjian fitness members has aroused social concern.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally, and then, rumors about the closure of the institution caused members to panic, leading to the intervention of the public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the agency came forward to respond, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm was quelled.
Some of the stores of individual fitness institutions have business problems, temporarily closed, consumers can be calm and wait for the problem to be solved, why the first reaction of many members is "big things are not good"?
Behind the rights protection of health club members is a deep-seated problem of the industry's trust crisis.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a pre-paid model, "earning money that users do not come" is the underlying logic of its development.
Through the pre-sale membership card to obtain cash flow, continue to open a new store, it seems that it can be recycled, but in fact, it can not form a stable profit model.
The frequent occurrence of negative information in the gym running and other industries has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the perspective of market prospects, of course, the gym is a good business with "money".
Although the fitness track has ups and downs, it has always received capital attention.
A number of data show that the popularity of cultural consumption and other fields continues to rise, and the market continues to pick up.
Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards, the concept of healthy life is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the development of the fitness industry is promising.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, individual institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption, just out of the crisis, and sounded the trumpet of territorial expansion, and put the financing funds into the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that in recent years, affected by the epidemic, many institutions have withdrawn, the industry has reshuffled, and powerful enterprises have selectively increased their acquisition efforts and re-layout at this time, not a new opportunity.
However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous circle and move on the road of stability and long-distance, the industry must change the traditional model and change the business strategy.
Only by steadily fighting and re-establishing the trust and security of consumers can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared with the construction of new stores to seize the market, the fitness industry needs to calm down to optimize services and stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, it is necessary to retain users through service.
The gym belongs to the service industry, the essence is to adhere to the "user-oriented", to focus on the needs of users, the focus of the operation on the service quality upgrade.
Second, we must rely on digital transformation to improve the user experience.
For example, the current popular Internet gym model realizes users pay on a monthly basis and choose their own venues.
At the same time, the physical data and exercise data can be effectively used, which can also meet social needs and achieve a complete service closed loop from online to offline.
No private education sales, no huge annual card, users' concerns about the fitness institution's "running away" have decreased, and the sense of trust has increased.
In addition, we must actively explore the diversification of the business.
Today, sports consumption has gone from a single service to scene consumption, fitness clubs are expected to become a new entrance to consumption, around the fitness required sports supplies and fitness equipment and other peripheral products may become a new profit point, to provide consumers with a richer choice.

Nanjing property market reproduces "differency payment"-Zhongxin.com
Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Yibo) Yangzi Evening News / Purple Bull News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the "guaranteed price agreement" that has not been seen for more than ten years has returned to the Nanjing real estate market, and a real estate located in Jiangbei New District claims "differency payment", and the discount of other housing sources before delivery is greater than the previous discount, the developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
There are many conditions for the "price guarantee agreement"
The property in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Yuntai, and Mr. Sun, a housekeeper, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the property last weekend.
He sent a picture to the reporter that the developer of the property promised that if the purchase of the property is purchased between February 1 and February 28, from the date of signing the purchase and sale contract between the two parties to the corresponding housing delivery, if the preferential discount of the other listings of the project is greater than the discount on the previous purchase (limited to the same type of the commercial house, the same building, the same unit, the same property type of other unsold commercial houses), the developer can change the house and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a "guaranteed agreement", the purpose is to let buyers rest assured, do not worry about the development of the enterprise price reduction promotion, "now afraid to buy it it is down, go to the sales office to have no time, do not bother the words are really worried."
There are also many buyers who believe that although the "guaranteed price agreement" is to give buyers a "reassurance pill", but the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who intends to buy a new housing in Jiangbei, said that the price of the house first needs the same type, but also in the same building, the same unit, the buyer can compare the price of the housing source is few, so the "threshold" is still quite high.
Some buyers believe that due to the asymmetry of information, sales do not rule out giving additional concessions, and buyers are not very difficult to "rights protection".
Whether to keep the buyer remains to be seen.
The reporter inquired about the online real estate in Nanjing and learned that the property in November last year, the two buildings of the leader's two buildings were sold, with an apartment area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc. The average price of the full decoration and sales was 39,843 yuan / m2.
However, in the past two months, online real estate has shown that the total number of unsold units of the property is currently 157, accounting for 62.3%, of which 128 sets are not sold in No. 8, 113 sets have not been sold, and 44 sets of 124 sets of buildings in Building 7 have not been sold, and the total number of sets of projects is only 33, accounting for only 13%.
According to market participants, the "Insurance Agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, in order to attract the attention of buyers, the real estate of Hexi Huangshan Road, Hexi Huangtang Xiyuan, launched the "price guarantee plan", the specific content is "the company solemnly promised that if the preferential range of the project is expanded within one year, the resulting difference, the company will return the difference to the old owners."
Since then, in April 2011, there are also nine real estates in Nanjing that have committed to "spreading payments" by some housing sources.
"The property market is warming up, and at this time, a need for a 'strengthening agent' is more."
Mr. Shen, a senior trader in the real estate industry in Nanjing, said that the "price guarantee agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of housing enterprises.
He believes that today's development enterprises need more confidence than buyers, and the launch of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually giving it cheer.
As for whether to retain buyers, he said that this depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, it remains to be seen.
A number of data recessions Taiwan's economy underperformed in the beginning of the year
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11 (Reporter Zhao Bo, Huang Yang) The export trade volume is "five black", the manufacturing purchasing manager index (PMI) has been tight for seven consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has seen "three words"... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have released economic data for January 2023.
Experts believe that Taiwan's economic performance in the beginning of the year is not good, and the pressure of growth is not small.
According to the Taiwan authorities' financial affairs department, Taiwan exported $31.51 billion in January this year, with an annual decrease of 21.2%, and negative growth for the fifth consecutive month.
The export value of the 11 major export categories has declined compared with the same period last year.
Plastic rubber and its products, optical equipment fell the most, respectively, decreased by 37.6%, 35.7%.
Electronic component exports decreased by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, the annual reduction of integrated circuits was 18.3%, the largest decline in 14 years.
Cai Meina, director of the department's statistics department, said that this shows that the weak demand of the consumer electronics industry has spread, and the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that in January, Taiwan's import and export fell, exceeding the amount of only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The competent financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the global terminal demand has decreased, the industry has adjusted inventory to curb the willingness of manufacturers to buy materials, and the export downturn is difficult to improve in the short term, and Taiwan's export recession in the first quarter of this year is likely to be higher than expected.
According to Taiwan's China Economic Research Institute, Taiwan's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 40.4% seasonally adjusted in January this year, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and tightened for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring index system, the PMI is based on the 50% boom and bust line, and the index is greater than 50%, which represents the expansion of the economy, and on the contrary, it is a contraction.
Among the five constituent indicators of Taiwan's PMI in January, the new orders, production and manpower employment were tightened, supplier delivery times fell, and inventory was tightened.
The six major industries have a total return on PMI tightening, and each industry is ranked according to the tightening speed of the power and machinery and equipment industry (35.1%), the electronics and optical industry (35.2%), the chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), the basic raw materials industry (42.4%), the transportation industry (42.6%) and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the Taiwan authorities' "Chief Office of Master" announced that Taiwan's annual CPI growth rate was 3.04% in January this year, and has broken through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, the price of vegetables soared 28.25%, a 17-month high.
Taiwan's "master accounting office" special member Cao Zhihong admitted that the increase in vegetable prices is indeed higher than expected, excluding the Spring Festival factors, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year, inflation pressure is still present, and is still at a high point.
Looking forward to Taiwan's economy this year, comprehensive "United Daily", "Yahoo Finance" and other island media reports, experts said pessimistic.
Wu Dazhen, a professor in the Department of Economics of Taiwan's "Central University", analyzed that the export recession may cause problems in the cash flow of export manufacturing manufacturers and increase the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the reduction of orders has led manufacturers to reduce labor costs, affecting the labor market and the family economy, which in turn has impacted consumption capacity.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Economic Research Institute, believes that inflation in Europe and the United States has not been solved this year, and demand has continued to shrink, and it is expected that Taiwan's export recession will continue into the first half of the year.
Because Taiwan's economy is supported by exports and affected by the downturn in exports, the annual economic growth performance will not be as good as last year.
"An important engine of global recovery" - Sino-Singapore Network
"In response to the impact of the new crown epidemic, China's economy has shown strong resilience.
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
Julio Rios, a well-known expert on China in Spain and honorary adviser to China Policy Observer Network, said in an interview with this reporter that at present, China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Rios said that in the face of various factors exceeding expectations, China has responded calmly with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully reflecting its economic resilience and management level.
While China is unswervingly expanding its opening-up, the endogenous driving force of economic development is increasing, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises are developing in synergy.
Every year, the two sessions of the National People's Congress of China are held, and on behalf of the members, they discuss the national development plan and discuss the hot issues of people's livelihood, and widely build consensus, gather people's hearts, and gather wisdom to add strength to China's development.
"Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term rapid development and has entered a stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to China's wisdom and China's solutions, and it expects China's development to bring new opportunities to the world.
Rios said that at present, China is making every effort to promote scientific and technological innovation and inject new impetus into economic and social development, "capital investment, talent training, and policy incentives, which makes China continue to be dynamic in the new five-year plan."
In Rios’s view, economic reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has not only given full play to the strengths of the market economy, but also played the superiority of the socialist system, and taken proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on expanding the strategic base of domestic demand, increasing financial support for the real economy, supporting the development of private, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing industries, adhering to innovative development, promoting employment, improving the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meeting the diversified consumption needs of the people at multiple levels... China has fully, accurately and comprehensively implemented the new development concept, focused on promoting high-quality development, and building a new development pattern will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative.
"The economic stabilization and recovery after the epidemic is the common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to all countries in the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
Rios said that he expects the joint construction of the "Belt and Road" cooperation to continue to play its important role in improving the level of infrastructure of various countries and strengthening connectivity in various fields, and continue to release greater momentum.

Xinhua News Agency commentator
"Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project, which needs to be coordinated, systematically planned, and promoted as a whole, and correctly handle a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practice exploration, strategy and strategy, integrity and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, and self-reliance and opening up."
At the opening ceremony of the seminar of members, alternate members and leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels of the New Central Committee to learn and implement Xi Jinping's socialist ideas with Chinese characteristics in the new era and the 20th spiritual seminar of the Party, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the law of modernization construction, and systematically clarified a series of major relationships that need to be handled in practice, providing a scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves all fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, ecological civilization, and related to governing the party, governing the country, governing the country, domestic and foreign affairs, and national defense, it is necessary to do a good job in systematic planning, but also to have the courage to reform and innovate, and constantly promote the whole.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to deeply understand the general trend of world development, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, deeply explore the laws of economic and social development, so that the formulation of the planning and policy system reflects the times, grasps the regularity, is creative, and realizes the combination of near and far, the communication of the up and down, and the coordination of the content.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory undertaking, and there are still many uncharted areas that need to be boldly explored in practice, promote career development through reform and innovation, and must not be engraved with swords and waiting for rabbits.
The strategic issue is a fundamental issue for a political party and a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to enhance the forward-looking strategy, foresee the future with a scientific strategy, and lead the future; to enhance the overall nature of the strategy, focusing on solving the major problems related to the success or failure of the party and the state, and to move the whole body; to enhance the stability of the strategy, once the strategy is formed, it is necessary to adhere to it for a long time, grasp it to the end, and do well.
It is necessary to scientifically grasp the dialectical and unified relationship between strategy and strategy, organically combine the flexibility of strategic principles and strategies, be flexible, flexible, flexible, flexible, and decisive, and grasp the strategic initiative in accordance with local conditions, moving according to the situation, and following the trend.
The Chinese nation is a nation that is committed to innovation.
To handle the relationship between correctness and innovation, we must not only adhere to the roots, roots and soul of Chinese-style modernization, unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization, and place innovation in the prominent position of national development, conform to the development requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively change and adapt to change, vigorously promote reform and innovation, and constantly shape the new momentum and new advantages of development.
Efficiency is an important basis for fairness, and fairness is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must not only create higher efficiency than capitalism, but also maintain social fairness more effectively, and better realize the balance, promotion and unity of efficiency and fairness.
We will handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness, continuously realize development for the people, rely on the people for development, and share the fruits of development with the people, so that the achievements of modernization will benefit all people more fairly.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we need to deal with the relationship between vitality and order, so that society is both vibrant and stable and orderly.

The Biden administration blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the spy balloon program on Friday.
The Commerce Department said the five Chinese companies and a research institute helped modernize China’s military, especially aerospace programs, including airships and aircraft.
Blacklisted companies have a hard time getting U.S. technology exports.
The list is called the “entity list,” and the listed companies will not be able to purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they are granted a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronic Technology Group 48 Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
The White House said it was considering broader measures to “discover and address” China’s threat to U.S. national security over larger surveillance activities.
The balloon incident triggered further tensions between China and the United States, and US Secretary of State Blinken cancelled his trip to China.
The United States shot down the balloon on February 4, and the Chinese government lodged stern representations with the U.S. Embassy in China, criticizing the efforts and process of the United States seriously impacting and harming the two sides to stabilize China-US relations.
From the evidence of the wreckage and information on the Chinese military’s procurement platform, the U.S. government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon was “directly related to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army” and was a supplier approved by the Chinese military.

China is strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it.
Matthew Axelrod, the Commerce Department’s assistant secretary for export enforcement, said: “Today’s operation shows that we have identified and prevented China from using spy balloons that violate the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries.
“
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhai Xiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said he was not aware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States and have not yet commented on the information.

Days after the earthquake in Turkey and parts of Syria, hopes of finding survivors are growing, but the five people rescued on Saturday are comforting to rescuers.
According to the Associated Press, the family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in the town of Nurdai, the hardest hit area in Gaziantep province.
Rescuers first pulled out of a pile of ruins from the mother and daughter, and then found the father, but he insisted on saving his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, cheers sounded in the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also rescued in harsh cold weather conditions.
“What day is it today?
The 129-hour teenager, trapped under the rubble, asked the rescuer to rescue himself after being brought back to the ground.
A man in Kahramanmaras holds the cat he just rescued.
The miraculous success of the rescue case has brought a glimmer of light to the already promising search and rescue work, but at the same time, the number of victims is also rising.
Monday's quake has killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey, with the death toll in neighboring Syria estimated at more than 3,500, according to official statistics.
While experts say people can survive for more than a week after being trapped in the rubble, hopes of finding more survivors have become slimmer.
Rescuers are still using thermal imaging to find signs of life under the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of relief efforts has shifted to helping survivors in dire need.
UN official: Disaster in the region 'uninfested' in a hundred years
At a press conference in Turkey, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths said the quake was the region’s “worst disaster in 100 years.”
He also praised Turkey’s post-disaster response as “extraordinary.”
He also told Reuters that he hoped the rescue would be provided to areas controlled by the Syrian government and the opposition, but said the matter was "not clear".
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in relief contributions to people in Syria's earthquake-hit areas.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced $25 million for relief efforts in Turkey and Syria.

Singapore’s tourism sector recovers strongly, with inbound travellers up 19 times from 2021
The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that it is expected that the number of international tourists visiting Singapore in 2023 will reach 12 million to 14 million, which will bring tourism benefits of about S$18 billion to S$21 billion; the number of tourists and tourism revenue will return to the level of about 67% to 75% before the new crown epidemic in 2019; the possibility of a full recovery of the tourism industry in 2024 is very high.
In 2022, the Singapore tourism market was gradually restarted and restored.
According to the latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board, the number of inbound passengers in 2022 increased by 19 times from 330,600 in 2021, reaching 6.3 million, surpassing the previous estimate of 4 million to 6 million passengers by the Tourism Bureau, and tourists have returned to the pre-epidemic level of 33%.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled S$8.96 billion, and it is expected that tourism revenue in 2022 will reach S$13.8 billion to S$14.3 billion, an increase of 6 to 7 times from S$1.89 billion in 2021, and have recovered to about 50% to 52% before the new crown epidemic in 2019.
The Singapore government has taken a number of measures to accelerate the recovery of tourism.
In April 2022, the government announced that it had allocated nearly S$500 million to stimulate the recovery of tourism.
The Tourism Bureau has announced plans to allocate S$110 million from the budget over the next two years to launch more business and leisure activities to attract tourists back.
In order to make health as one of the highlights of Singapore’s tourism, Tourism Singapore announced a call for intention on November 23, 2022, which plans to develop a healthy health attraction on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, executive director of sports and health tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have put their physical health at the top of various considerations.
The development of a healthy health site in the southern part of the coastal area with Gardens of the Marina Bay and the dyke is expected to contribute to Singapore’s tourism industry and economy, allowing tourists to spend and stay in Singapore for longer.
Chen Jianlong, director of the Singapore Tourism Bureau, said that in the next few years, health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism products.
The new coronavirus has increased public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourism Bureau has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists for the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held the first Health and Wellness Festival, which provided more than 130 health activities and experiences to the public.
Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences for visitors.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children’s Museum, the Avatar World of Marina Bay Gardens, the Sentosa Central Beach Market, the new “Exploring New Areas” exhibition hall of the Museum of Art Science, and the new open-air theatre at the Night Wildlife Park, the Tourism Board will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Flying Bird Park in the World of Wanzhou Wildlife, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will formulate relevant industry standards for conferences, exhibitions and incentives for the sustainable development of tourism in 2023, and focus on improving the two aspects of waste treatment and carbon emissions, and further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore’s tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
Data show that as of December 18, 2022, Changi Airport passenger traffic has recovered strongly, and as many as 150,000 passengers have been received every day, about 1 million per week, equivalent to about 75% before the new crown epidemic, and the number of employees in the aviation industry has returned to about 90% before the epidemic.
Data show that from January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million passengers, equivalent to 42% before the new crown epidemic, and 170,000 take-off and landing flights, which is 53% before the epidemic.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also led to the recovery of accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping.
Singapore’s government and tourism have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Ke Shudan, assistant director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that a survey by the Chinese travel platform shows that Singapore's safety index ranks among the top three in the world, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is deeply loved by Chinese tourists.
Before the new coronavirus epidemic, about 3.6 million people in China traveled to Singapore every year for vacation.
As China eases its border policy, Chinese visitors are expected to recover to 30 to 60 percent this year.
Ke Shudan pointed out that next, the Tourism Bureau will pay close attention to the signals further released by China's policy on outbound travel to cope with the change in the demand for tourists.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare for the reception of Chinese tourists in response to the new trends emerging from overseas travel.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that the recovery of the tourism industry will be faster than expected as long as the global economy does not have a significant recession affecting public revenue, and there will be no new large-scale deadly epidemic outbreak.

South Korean media pointed out that since the first public appearance of the Mars 17 missile on November 18 last year, the probability of exposure has been higher and higher in three months, and it has been the fifth time that it has appeared in the official occasion.
North Korean state media mentioned that when Kim's love, he used the most dear children, distinguished children and other high-respecting titles, and also broadcast fragments of Kim's love in the stands overlooking the parade when they were marching, shouting and swearing to death to support the white-headed bloodline.
These signs make the outside world doubt whether Kim love has been identified as the heir of the Kim regime, the Washington Post analysis that "this is Kim Jong-un's high school-age daughter to the status of the successor", but there are also views that such a judgment is still too early, in the case of Kim Jong-un's knee with a son, still retain all kinds of possibilities.
Zhongyang Q&A - How to view the United States January non-farm employment data greatly exceeded expectations and future trends - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
Q: How do you see the U.S. non-farm payrolls data in January that exceeded expectations and future trends?
A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released the January 2023 non-farm payrolls data, adding 517,000 new non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000 people; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in the past 50 years; hourly wages grew by 4.4% year-on-year, and the growth rate was 0.3% month-on-month, a slight slowdown.
From the total point of view, there are many one-time and technical factors in this data, such as the return of teachers and staff to the strike, the revision of the survey statistical caliber, the update of the quarterly adjustment factor, and the follow-up may be revised (referring to the new non-agricultural revised down from 504,000 to 364,000 in January 2022), and non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data.
From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is low; new employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels and education and health care has rebounded sharply, and the data shows that the labor shortage in the service industry still exists.
Combined with the recovery of the service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor gap data and the strength of consumer credit data, we judged that the US service industry has ushered in a rapid repair after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that supply and demand in the U.S. labor market will not improve without going through a recession.
At present, there is a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor force participation rate is slow, especially the 25-54-year-old labor force participation rate has been close to the pre-epidemic high.
In addition, due to the strong excess savings and consumer credit of U.S. residents, the strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of austerity on the job market.
The continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. labor market will be the basis for the US economy in 2023.
Overlaying the current near-end of interest rate hikes, inflation expectations continue to repeat, and we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Before the release of this data, the US stock bond market was too optimistic about the Fed's rate hike path.
With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Fed has also maintained a fragile balance of market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of interest rate hikes, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's preference for hawkish expressions, not only expected to stop raising interest rates early, but also expected to cut interest rates twice at the end of the year.
In the case of tight supply and demand in the labor market and the impact of tightening policies are unknown, we believe that the Fed's guidance for interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme expectations of the market and the crowding of transactions will cause some harm to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current rapid decline in inflation, with the M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of the leading indicators of each CPI sub-item, since October, the US CPI data has shifted to the rapid decline stage, the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a basis for future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market or enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.

After the strategic direction was determined, Spruce began to look for cooperation, at that time, Anshan Thermal Energy Institute for Ansteel supporting carbon research institute in the country 863 topics, scientific research funds are not enough, so spruce and Anshan Thermal Energy Institute carbon research institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the national 863 project "intermediate carbon microsphere" project industrialization, engaged in the research and development of negative materials, production and sales, in the country to achieve commercial promotion of negative materials.
In 2001, Shanshan shares to achieve the large-scale production of intermediate carbon microspheres, began to localize the replacement, replacing Japan as the main supplier of domestic intermediate carbon microspheres.
This is the first lithium-ion battery anode material production enterprise in China, and realizes the localization of lithium-ion battery anode materials.
With the rapid popularization of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Shanshan shares began to develop gradually, in 2007 the lithium-ion material business was written into the main business of Shanshan shares, clothing business revenue ratio decreased year by year, until 2013, Shanshan shares of lithium-ion materials business revenue across the board more than the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan shares successfully acquired LG's chemical polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer company, Sugimoto Optoelectronics, the technical content of the field is relatively high, and the main competitors of cedar are the world's top 500, such as South Korea Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Electric.
Zheng Yonggang once shared the experience of post-investment management, "China's private enterprises to buy some international high-tech enterprises, the probability of success is relatively low, why those acquisitions will fail?
Because everyone will consider, I spent so much money, I have to send people to manage, this is usually done an act", but Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition of spruce, Zheng Yonggang went to Sugian Optoelectronics in public announced, spruce as the majority shareholder of cedar, decided to implement a company and two systems, in addition to Zheng Yonggang as chairman, the people of the sequoia company do not send to the management, take the way of authorized operation, the original distribution system, corporate culture, management and other models.
ICC Xinhua Information released 2022 negative pole data show that cedar anode 2022 shipments exceeded 200,000 tons, an increase of 100% year-on-year, market share of 16%, artificial graphite anode material shipments ranked first.
In terms of polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that the company's Sugijin Optoelectronics 2022 global market share reached 29%, is expected to reach 32% in 2023 market share, continue to rank first in the world.

A large and medium-sized public fund customer service staff in Shanghai provided a 6-digit invitation code to the reporter of the Economic Observer Network, and told reporters, "In the trial operation stage of APP, China Settlement provided each fund manager with a certain number of invitation codes, and investors came to get it by phone, and we will provide it."
After the trial run, there is no need to use the invitation code when opening the user registration.
“
The reporter according to the SFC official website of the "fund E account" download and use of the instructions of the relevant documents for the account registration and check, the whole process takes only a few minutes, mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, public fund inquiry.

Reaching a defensive consensus with the United States, Japan and the Philippines
ASIA – On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan to meet with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's aggression against the South China Sea and the East China Sea, and the Philippine and Japanese leaders issued a joint statement after the meeting, saying that they will conduct substantive defense exchanges through the signing of a trilateral defense agreement with the United States and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Kishida hopes to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies against the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos visited China in early January this year and received a $20 billion agreement.
But after this, Sino-Philippine relations not only did not improve, but fell.
Earlier this month, the Philippines and the United States signed an agreement to open more bases to the U.S. military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
One of the new bases is 300 kilometers from Taiwan and is the closest location to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the U.S. military may launch operations at bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States to build a "confrontation of the Chinese Communist Party's arc" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyi's Visit to China Sends Song Tao Language: Welcome Green Camp Visit to Lu under the 1992 Consensus
Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Chinese Nationalist Party of Taiwan, met with Song Tao, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of China, and Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the Kuomintang official organization, was interviewed by the Taiwan Central News Agency last night, and positively commented on Song Tao's statement to Xia Lizhi that as long as it agrees with the "1992 consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, China welcomes green campers to visit the mainland.
The National Party is said to be new.
Xia Lixuan earlier met with Song Tao's news did not mention this statement.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party has repeatedly clarified its rejection of the "1992 Consensus".
According to the Central News Agency today, Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang Xia Lixing led a delegation to visit the land, during the period in Beijing, respectively, met with Wang Huning, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new director of the State Taiwan Affairs Office, and Yin Li, the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
Xia Lixian and Song Tao met to talk about the political foundation of the Communist Party of China is the "1992 consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, Zhao Chunshan, senior adviser of the Kuomintang National Political Foundation, said at the meeting that the Kuomintang's "92 consensus" is the original "1992 consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analysis, which is different from the previous meetings involved in the feeling.
Recently, the video discussion with the mainland academic community, as well as this discussion, did not hear scholars from Taiwan talk about martial arts and "anti-secession law", but instead resumed exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the cross-strait soldiers are in danger, and mainland China hopes to convey the intention of improving relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the DCP, the other side is still willing to do a good job for the Taiwanese people, and the representative does not want cross-strait relations to be broken.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally instructed Song Tao to say "their (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen) requirements, you must implement", if you can not solve the problem in a comprehensive manner, but also to take a case to deal with.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang people visited the mainland to refer to the daily disturbance of Chinese military aircraft and warships, the problem of agriculture and fishing in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether the Central News Agency reporter asked such questions.
French trade unions once again mobilise anti-government retirement reform program march
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions once again launched a national mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling on the public to take to the streets to express their views.
This is the fourth day of action against the social trend of the draft reform of the government pension system.
How many people respond to the call for a rally may affect the next course of action of the trade union group.
This is the fourth time in a month that eight of France’s top trade union groups have co-sponsored a national mobilisation, and the first time the protests have been scheduled for a rally on Saturday.
Given that for most French people, Saturday is a public holiday, they don’t need to choose between taking part in demonstrations or wage strikes, trade union groups want today’s rally to attract more people.
The union of the subway and the public railway company did not call for a strike by employees today, the bus system should be able to operate normally, and citizens can travel to the meeting place by car, and at the same time, in the area where the school began to take winter holidays, people can normally start the degree of vacation.
Trade union groups hope that more than one million people will attend the rally today, while the police expect the number of participants nationwide may be between 600,000 and 800,000, and the Paris city may gather 90,000 to 120,000 people.
Since the anti-government pension reform protests began, while polls show that most French people do not support the move to send the mandatory retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people who actually take to the streets to participate in the march has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstrations on January 31 gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people across the country.
Demonstrations on Tuesday have shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million across the country.
The pension reform programme is currently under discussion in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially the opposition caucus, led by the radical left, submitted numerous amendments, so that the review process was very slow.
And the debate between the ascents is becoming increasingly fierce.
A member of the radical left-wing party France's Unyielding Party has sent a picture of himself on social media with a balloon emblazoned with the head of a labor minister, triggering protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly eventually announced a 15-day ban on the member from participating in parliamentary activities as a punishment for such acts.
While the reform package has triggered the biggest social boom in France in more than two decades, the government has so far made no major concessions, albeit with some changes to the draft.
The union is ready to launch another action next Thursday, 16, and on March 7, when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion, the union also plans to organize demonstrations.

China's Yunnan Province Human Sperm Bank issued publicity on the 9th, soliciting college degree or above or students to donate sperm, and successfully donated 8 to 12 times can receive a subsidy of 4,500 yuan.
According to Taiwan media reports today, the message rushed to Weibo hot search on the same day, and triggered many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing to follow up.
According to the Free Times, China encourages college students to donate sperm.
Among them, Beijing's sperm donation threshold is the highest, in addition to education, it is also required to be height of more than 170 cm, five official correct, no obvious hair loss, the number of myopia can not be higher than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Province Human Sperm Bank pointed out that sperm donors can get a full set of male physical examination worth 1,000 yuan, "especially semen and chromosome testing, most people have never done, it is of great significance to understand their fertility status."
The conditions for sperm donors include people with height of more than 165 cm, college degree or above, and those with weak color-free blindness and hepatitis B and other genetic diseases and infectious diseases.
The report quoted Chinese Tianmu News as saying that the human sperm bank in Shaanxi Province was printed with "paid sperm donation, infinite glory" propaganda posters, calling on young people to respond to sperm donation, and encouraged netizens to forward relevant messages and "let love pass".
Shaanxi provincial price code is higher than Yunnan, qualified people can receive 300 yuan of cash each time, to complete a certain number of sperm donors can get a subsidy of 5000 yuan.
At present, the highest known price is Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
The last Communist prime minister in East Germany has died.
The successor to the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that “last night Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.”
As a result, our party has lost an important leader.
“
On November 13, 1989, four days after opening the Berlin Wall, which separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Modro had said he would help turn East Germany into a democracy.
At the time, Communist Party leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
After the Soviet Union came to power, Mikhail Gorbachev called for changes in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election result led him to no longer serve as prime minister.
Despite the reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political change and unification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reshape rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modero was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but was not jailed.
The allegations are politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modro continued to serve in the German Parliament and was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modero sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters he did not want the return of the Old East Germany, but said he should acknowledge East Germany’s achievements.
Modro was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a leader of the youth fire brigade and was a member of the Nazi militia group Volkssturm, a Nazi militia group that enlisted men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight the final war.
At the age of 17, Modro was captured by Soviet troops and brought to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he took anti-fascist courses and became a staunch Communist.
In 1949, the year East Germany was founded, he returned home to work as a mechanic and went on to study social sciences and economics, where he received his doctorate.
Modero was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which was joined by almost all young East Germans and was promoted to president of the Dresden Regional Party from 1973 to 1989 through the ruling Socialist Unionist Party (SED).
He has also served in the East German parliament for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modro became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest national position.
Iran Commemorates Revolution Anniversary, Hackers Pro-Protest Hacking Speaks on President's TV Address
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Raisi's televised speech.
The president’s televised speech was interrupted for about a minute on the internet, and a group of anti-Iranian government hackers appeared on the screen with a sign named “Edalat Ali.”
There was also a voice chanting “Death to the Islamic Republic.”
Reuters reported today that Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution, and hackers interrupted state television reports.
Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, and Raisi’s hardline government faces the boldest challenges posed by young protesters who asked them to step down, but Raisi still calls for “deluded youth” to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran’s supreme leader.
After 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the country’s morality police in September, nationwide protests swept still in Iran.
Iran’s security forces have carried out a deadly crackdown on the protests, one of the most powerful challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the 1979 revolution overturned the 2,500-year-old monarchy.
As part of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities on Friday released jailed dissident Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha, who went on hunger strike.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty that included some of the prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
Human rights group HRANA reported that as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
The report said 70 Government security personnel were also killed.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have called for a vote at Saturday’s rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On the evening of the Iranian Revolution anniversary on Friday night, state media showed fireworks as part of a government-sponsored celebration, with people chanting “Allahu Akbar!”
(God is the greatest!)
However, many people can also be heard shouting “Dictator to die!”
As well as the “Death of the Islamic Republic” in a video posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television aired live footage of official rallies in the states.
In Tehran, domestic anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed as part of official celebrations.
President Lacy’s speech was often interrupted by the slogan “Death to America” — a signature slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted “Israel is going to die.”
Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months, Reuters said.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on national security charges.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she went back to prison.
Adelkhah has denied the allegations.
Mesami was released a week after supporters warned he was at risk of death from a hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting the forced wearing of a headscarf.
The French foreign ministry responded to Adelkhah’s release on Friday, calling for her freedom to be restored, “including allowing her to return to France if she wants to.”

Balloon incident more polished the eyes of the United States?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to the Wall Street Journal today, after the balloon incident, the United States is ready to further tighten its technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials said the balloon incident highlighted a national security threat posed by China and would garner more political support to strengthen U.S. technology protection.
The U.S. said the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communications.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official now working for the New American Security Center, a Washington think tank, said.
"This is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire and supporting the view of the hardliners on China."
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that “we will also consider taking greater action to expose and respond to China’s larger surveillance activities that pose a threat to our national security and our allies and partners.”
U.S. officials said they had briefed governments in more than 30 countries on the balloon incident, and that international coordination was crucial to responding to the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the Biden administration’s actions, the newly created U.S. House of Representatives Ad Hoc Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party may also pressure the United States to take tougher measures to slow China’s development.
She said members of Congress would feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn could force the White House to take a tougher policy.
The Wall Street Journal said that many advocates for stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also working on a foreign investment review program to examine whether U.S. investment abroad poses a potential national security threat from China.
Analysts say the White House could face calls for a faster rollout of the program.
Turkey earthquake relief day and night
Since the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have worked day and night among the ruins of thousands of earthquake-defeated buildings to rescue survivors buried under the rubble.
In the icy temperatures, they often called for to be quiet, as they tried to hear any sound of life from the dilapidated pile of concrete.
Reuters reported today that two more women survived the rubble of the quake and were rescued a few days later.
However, the death toll from the earthquake climbed to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey is 20,665, and the death toll in Syria is more than 3,500.
The 7.8-magnitude quake, which continued to have several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria on Monday, was the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan’s 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which was close to 31,000 deaths in neighboring Iran in 2003.
A similarly intense earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women had been trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in 20 years in the region, and rescuers rescued the two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey.
Another injured 55-year-old man was identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, Turkey’s largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the icy temperatures, rescuers often call for silence as they struggle to hear any sound of life from the dilapidated pile of concrete.
In Turkey’s Samandag district, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs and whispered “Inshallah” — “God bless” — who carefully reached into the rubble and rescued a 10-day-old newborn.
He opened his eyes wide, and the baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to a field hospital.
Video images showed first responders also taking his mother away, who was dizzy on the stretcher, pale but sane.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and a total of 31,000 rescue workers had been deployed in the affected areas.
About 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, he said, while 1.05 million people were left homeless by the quake, which they crowded into temporary shelters.
Because many people lack food in the cold winter conditions, there are growing questions about the response of the two leaders to the disaster.
According to Syrian state media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, along with his wife Asma, travelled to a hospital in Aleppo, where he was reportedly his first trip to the affected area since the quake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said its stockpile in northwestern Syria, which is under rebel-held control, was about to run out as a result of the war that complicated relief efforts.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey’s Adyaman province, where he acknowledged that the government’s response had not hit the pace expected.
Opponents have seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a May 14 vote, but could be delayed by a disaster.
Reuters said anger over delays in aid and the launch of relief efforts could affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the toughest challenge in Erdoğan’s two decades in power.
Erdogan called for solidarity and condemned what he called a “negative movement for political gain.”
Turkey's main opposition leader, Kemal Kilidarogru, criticized the government's reaction.
“The earthquake was large, but more serious than the earthquake was a lack of coordination, a lack of planning and incompetence.

What is the "object" that was shot down over Alaska?
Disturbed, guessing.
The U.S. military on Friday afternoon again used the F-22, the most advanced stealth jet fighter in the United States, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska.
The shooting was 10 miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the U.S. military has shot down an aerial flying object.
On Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted over U.S. airspace for several days before being destroyed near the U.S. coast of South Carolina.
The Pentagon said the second object, which was shot down, first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), about the size of a small car, and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that had previously been shot down.
The Pentagon also believes there is no indication that the object is maneuverable.
John Kirby, the White House National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications, said Friday that while the exact appearance of the high-altitude object is unclear, it “poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft.”
Bryant said the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the U.S., did not have a “payload” on it.
“We call it an ‘object’ the best description we can make at the moment.”
President Biden listened to the Pentagon's advice before ordering the shooting down of the object, and he was "very cautious" when making the decision, Kobe added.
The official description of this object in the United States can be roughly summarized as follows: the size is equivalent to a car, no joystick, no suspension device, and the altitude is about 10,000 meters.
But this information can not answer the basic questions, such as what kind of thing the object is, what it belongs to, what task it is performing.
At present, many online analysis and speculation believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It may have come from China, as did the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon that fluttered over Latin America, who carried out some sort of mission in different locations.
Some have also linked this Alaskan “object” to a “unidentified flying object” (UFO).
The U.S. Newsweek report quoted former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday that “I really hope this ‘UFO’ is also a spy balloon, not a legal UFO.”
“The irony of conflating an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it’s not worth triggering an interstellar conflict,” Major said.
Major sent the tweet shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said it was more than just Major who suspected the object was a UFO.
Republican Rep. Tim Burchett, a Republican in Tennessee, criticized the administration’s cover-up last month, asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on “UFOs.”
Amazon's customer service attitude makes it difficult for me to believe
I think very few people see it here, but I want to say it a little bit too.
This dress was a zipper hoodie when we bought it, and finally gave it to me with a short sleeve.
After receiving the clothes immediately with the Amazon customer service contact, when confirming that the clothes are still in stock, I asked for a change of goods, customer service said to solve it, and then immediately saw the product name become short sleeves, the original I bought the link off the shelf.
Then the customer service notice either retains the goods to compensate for a certain amount, or returns.
Is this the way Amazon handles it?
It’s really unbelievable that it’s not my problem to make a mistake in the clothes itself, as a consumer I ask for the goods I’m going to get, and there’s nothing exaggerated, but Amazon has changed its name to say there’s no inventory.
This is my first comment, and I hope this is not my last.
Incomprehensible sleeves.
It is said to be cowhide, it is indeed relatively hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in the part, it is not clear whether it is leather, and the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible, usually the sleeves of the jacket are longer than the clothes, but usually 1-2 cm, this dress is 5 cm long, the arm naturally droops in the position of the palm of the tiger, but the sleeves of this dress are covered with fingers.
It is easy to buy clothes and easy to return.
When is it important to return the money?
The clothes are good, because the version is small, only have to return, but after the return, so far more than a week has passed, has not received a refund?
And to ask the purchaser to contact the full peak express with that dishonesty, this is the worst purchase since the purchase of Amazon's items!
But the store is still good, actively cooperate with the prompt delivery of timely refunds, but this full peak express real work is done is quite angry, dragged about half a month before the refund, this partner is to drag Amazon's hind legs, poor work efficiency, no sense of service!
More suitable for young people.
99 seconds to kill.
The workmanship, color and feel of the trousers are good, soft/thin and moderate, and there is no kerosene flavor.
Unfortunately, the version is thin and more suitable for young people.
3XL, tile waist 2 feet 5, stretching maximum size of 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg wearing waist a little tight.
It seems that there is no tight belt in the waist, and it is difficult to add a loose waistline.
In addition, wearing is uncomfortable.
Very good color is not very bright.
I bought it more than two hundred times, what is the situation?
The first time Amazon used the cooperation of the daily bad courier, the first delivery did not come at home, and then took the initiative and the courier about two delivery time, the courier did not send, and then directly returned to me, this damn courier is not honest, it is strongly recommended not to use that daily bad courier.
This time, there is also a t-shirt that returns me, and then the price of more than 100 yuan.
Amazon should not be self-employed with such a product.
When the special price of the product is purchased, the price is not low, and the review is also a very good product.
When I actually received the product, I was stunned, the surface of the product was a large area of wear, and many other places had wear, not defective or old, which was later charted.
I apply for a return, the manufacturer's people see the picture after saying that it is the result of transportation, this is not nonsense?
How can the inside of the product be worn out?
There are only two possibilities, either the old product is seconded, or it is I deliberately damage the product and then take it back.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence that I have not damaged the goods, but in terms of my credit history of Amazon shopping, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon's own goods, customers choose Amazon's own self-operated is trust, customer win, we win, the customer's victory is the victory of the manufacturer, I hope everyone work together to improve, thank you.
I used the product less than a year ago, there were two E2s, I don't know how to deal with it?
I bought the product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016 the two groups on the right of the receiver often appear red E2, should be the launch module problem, which is not much in line with the launch module on Amazon.com for 7 years of sustainable work, in the Amazon website and can not find after-sales, now I don't know how to do it?
It's okay.
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn’t feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the machine-body label was broken.
It’s always a white screen.
Change it later.
The exchange is very fast, the evening is a little vague, the perspective is not very wide, but ordinary families are enough.
The lack of cards is no card, buy your own, and have bought a mobile phone on Amazon before.
There will be stickers on the packaging to prevent the packaging from being opened, this time there is no, there is a sticker-like chapter when buying a mobile phone, which can be attached to the warranty card, this time no.
I don't know if it's cheap, it's confusing.
Waiting for the supplier to respond
The packaging does not have any logo, directly to the supplier to call, answer no logo is the original, such as suspected that the can be used to mail to Johnson Johnson inspection, but also leave a license plate number and phone number, promised to send a text message to my information into the Johnson Johnson Corps official website warranty card, so far did not receive a text message ah?
I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
The second purchase.
Amazon’s own products are reassuring.
The master of oil change said that the oil is clear, and it is indeed good oil.
Because it was the second purchase.
So it's still very reassuring.
Express speed, packaging is not picky place, with this oil, the sound of the engine dropped significantly.
The price is good, it is difficult to find synthetic oil below 200.
Support the star crown, support the winning card, and effectively protect the car.
Japan's Amazon has suffered serious damage to buyers' interests due to customer service problems (8c caterpillars shipped to 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
Admitting errors, but has been prevaricating, always emphasizing that the goods are third parties and cannot be bound by third parties.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
I originally purchased the page size option is 7c, 8, 9c, when I felt that this is a trap, call the Chinese customer service in Japan, clearly tell 8 is 8c, but when the goods returned to China, only 8cm, I think this is a completely deliberately set trap to pit the Chinese people (according to Amazon after-sales), now the page has no this option.
Chinese customer service: I am sorry, it has brought you a loss, we give you two ways:
1, you return the goods, the buyer bear all the freight.
2, you do not return, we compensate you 1000 yen.
(I count the account, shoes more than 4,000 yen, counted as 200rmb, choose 1, I have no shoes, the loss of 200 yuan.)
Option 2, I have shoes, finally compensated me 2000 yen, and finally the loss in 150rmb customer service: we have recorded, we will seriously deal with, the next day to return the seal of the mail, said I do not accept the Chinese customer service mediation, this is over.
When I proposed that the page purchased is 7c, 8,9c with a confusing option, the Chinese customer service helped me to say that the Japanese common code is not like C, similar to 140, but have you go to other caterpillar pages to see?
There are all beauty codes, and the situation of daily code mixing appears.
In addition, why do you put 8cm in the middle of 7c and 9c, obviously the smallest size, what do you mean by putting it there?
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese services, but do not know that you want to transport home, so your freight is not claimable.
This logic I do not understand, I am Japanese, I also want Chinese customer service, living in Japan in China also do not need Chinese customer service, to Japanese tourists, no kung fu to play international long distance, then the problem comes, who needs to call Amazon overseas to buy Chinese phone, nothing more than like me.
Isn't Amazon Chinese customer service just convenient for these people who are in Haitao?
This purchase is not satisfactory.
This is the second time from Amazon to buy a diaper, once in the baby 2 months to buy a box, choose the European imported paper diaper, the first purchase experience is still relatively satisfactory, the baby all night with a diaper, can indeed meet 12 hours do not change diapers.
However, this time to buy the L number of diapers, a box with 2 packs of separate packaging, open it feels that the paper is loose, and there is a clear difference with the imported help treasure, after the baby is used, it is possible, there is no leak of urine and no signs of red rash.
However, to the second pack of diapers, after the baby's thighs began to appear immediately on the inside of the rash, so far has not faded.
Doubt 1 box inside the two packs, the quality is not the same.
I won’t buy it again!
We want to pay attention to the protection of the package.
It’s been my online shopping for so long, seeing the worst one packaging shipping, no protective measures at all, buffer foam, package buffer materials, etc., nothing.
Just a broken box.
And the soft rubber box inside is packaged, and the card box is pressed to the deformation.
Hope is the quality of the product is guaranteed, in the future is not how dare to Amazon buy things.
I would rather be half expensive in the country, there is a guarantee point.
And the problem of commodity product packaging, I think the comments in 2016 have been commented, and now 19 years, it is still the same.
It shows that Amazon does not attach importance to the service feedback at all, and the domestic Jingdong, Tmall and so on are too far away.
Looks good, but a little sorry.
The color of the whole cup is my favorite, orange, although my family is a male treasure, but still feel that orange with yellow is very dazzling.
It’s smaller than I thought, but it was used to take them out, so it’s acceptable.
Last night took home to try, after the bottle cap pushed away, the distance between the straw and the lid is too close, because the position of the straw is vertical, so the son always want to put the bulge on the lid to contain water, feel whether this place can be improved.
It seems that other brands of straw cups make a tilt of the straw still makes sense, and the little child's thing really cares about safety and comfort.
Lightweight large capacity
Like it is light, large, that is, two separate separate bags for me a little superfluous, feel not know what to put on.
After buying, I found that there is another brand on the overseas purchase of the United States and Asia is very similar, less than two hundred dollars.
Fakes, fakes are great.
Amazon sells fakes, and I take it too.
The customer service said that because it was used, it could not be returned, and I did not know how to know that it was a fake.
Because of trust, so sad, after all, is the face of the supplies, really go to the physical store to buy it, recognition is a little more expensive.
Because it is a second kill, so I did not read the comments, I have submitted to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform, we will protect our rights together.
Bad?
Fakes?
In any case, tragedy.
With the second piece of the choice of pores meticulous, but as soon as the open is a strange smell, I think it is normal, because you have not used this, and then stick to the face when the whole can not stand, very punchy taste, can not describe, smoked to immediately cough out, eyes are also very painful, tears, immediately picked to wash your face.
Unbelief has opened a piece of the same paragraph, not so heavy taste, is now applied.
It’s a bit like the smell of poor quality hot water in a hair salon.
I can't imagine it, is it difficult to fall on Amazon's self-operated skin care products from now on to avoid it?
The traitors.
At that time of purchase, the activity page is said to be full of 99 yuan to give "three-body set", received the goods do not have this gift, call the customer service to say to show them the screenshots of the activities at that time, the question is who buys things and save the screenshots of the web page ah, you do the activities you have done, you also need customers to help you provide ah, the buyers should keep a close eye next time, save evidence.
Feel it later.
The first time in Amazon to buy things, feel a few points, first of all, the feeling of using the goods, the first is indeed painless, there is no irritating taste of things, overall very good, waiting for 8 minutes or so to wipe off, but there will be a small amount of sweat and slag on it, not to see is not visible, so said the overall is good, as to use once to continue to observe, continue to use will know.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
The second from the 27th order, the 12th received the goods, a total of 15 days that is half a month, Amazon's delivery staff service attitude is also very good.
Third, Amazon's what Black Friday do not believe, Friday order, wait for 2 days to cheaply close to 12 dollars, that is, I bought more than 170 (plus freight or whatever), there is a kind of activity to raise the price of the feeling.
Customer service said price fluctuations, I paid attention to more than 10 days of price is this way, the volatility is not big.
Affordable price, Japanese origin, Chinese label, with pellets, absolute buyback!
The paste body with particles, refreshing feeling is just right, with the back of the teeth smooth, more than a second-hand east, where it is said to be imported things, but a lot of things do not have a Chinese label, do not know where to wholesale.
As long as Amazon has, it will never go to the second-hand East.
To give a suggestion, Amazon's app on the sun can not sometimes sun, hoping to improve some applications, will do better and better!
Excellent over the years, more and more poor, there is no service quality can be said!
Waste excellence does not take into account customer needs When placing an order, the special delivery time is 19:00-22:00.
Because there are elderly people who are inconvenient to stay in bed after surgery at home, only the evening can be convenient to receive.
As a result, it was sent directly to the door at 12 noon, and it was not notified by telephone in advance.
If the delivery time is what time your courier wants to send what time, why do you have to take a time to let customers choose?
If your logistics can not guarantee the service, then simply do not do e-commerce!
Let an old man with 3 wounds on his body get out of bed and open the door to collect the courier and find change to pay!
There is a phone call on the order!
No one has ever called from the beginning to give an explanation!
The so-called complaint customer service of the excellent network is a group of foreigners who pretend to look like there, perfunctory your complaint and then give you a so-called answer.
There will be no change or compensation.
Before this is also encountered similar delivery time is not right, but this time can not bear, too much!
The pre-sale of the new book is actually the back cover and cover after the delivery of the new book, so that the quality problem is obvious so closed to send the book to the customer.
Comments will not be made to you.
Excellent over the years, more and more poor, there is no service quality can be said!
No more spending money on excellence.
The quality of the picture is unacceptable.
As a title such as "ancient atlas", this book is really unacceptable in the selection, typography, and printing of pictures, and some pictures even have mosaics that are blurred to unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even small-format illustrations should be worthy of the ancient literature left by the ancestors in the catalogue!
(In addition, many images are available to get clear original documents from relevant industry resources), and what is the difference between using such images to piece together books and not using pictures?
I feel sorry for this spirit of learning.
The text is not evaluated, and the family has a difference.
Overall 2 stars.
The second year of high school to read this book was just a boring attitude to see the play, feel that such a book itself should not be addicted to it, after all, the starting point of the network is still not very attractive to me.
And then... it fell into the hole.
According to this plot, the whole book is more relaxed and pleasant, the former part of the Ye Xiu is still in the online game, even if the guild between the heart of the fight, but also because of the often by the blood of the god of the god, made not heavy at all.
As for the part of the game, I wrote a little bit of a sad feeling of the old and new changes of the times (possibly my sentimentality).
Reading the whole book took me a lot of study time in my second high school, but I just couldn’t stop.
Full-time portrayal of the characters and emotional line is very amazing, some characters only occasionally take, will leave a deep influence, like the more focused portrayal of the role of Ye Xiu Huang Shaotian Su Mu orange are a large number of fans, not in the writing center of the role such as Jiangbo Tao Chuyun show and so on is also very popular, in an e-sports in the Shuang article can not find a disgusting character, this is the full-time in the character description of the success.
And on the emotional line, full-time and no ordinary online text is a reproachable harem of 30 million or beautiful women or corrupt problems, the full text of everyone's feelings, there is a common place is that they like to glory this game, and most of them want to be decent victory.
Small measures have no big conspiracy, and everyone looks so simple and lovely.
This may also be why there are no annoying roles for full-time.
Full-time IP is very large, also thanks to this.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online writing, full-time is a good book.
How much he really would give someone some hot blood, a little moved.
In April of this year, full-time animation.
In fact, I want to buy this book for a long time, because the wallet is not thick enough to start, and then want to buy when you find that tb is simply a fake, in fact, full-time recently out of another version, the cover diagram is quite like, but still intend to buy the old version, so on Amazon to see, a one-time purchase.
Let’s talk about the goods.
The fourth book is not sealed, but the book is new.
The 17th seal is in, but it is opened, and the texture of the book is very strange to feel that there is no other hard.
The 23rd book is the same as the seventeenth, but it is also harder than the seventeenth, but very old.
The publishers of individual books are different as if the 23rd and 17th are the same publishing house, and the other is different.
Overall, it is satisfied, 24 books are a big one box, which is very satisfying.
The Fallen Lion.
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner", and the result was a lot of text!
I read this book three times before I finished reading this book to children, a little lion who would shoot, a little lion who loved fruit juice fudge.
When I saw the lion eating the hunter, the heart was slightly uncomfortable, and modern urban people were a little unacceptable for the arrangement of being eaten by animals.
At the end of the day, this little lion, who has succeeded in human society, has lost himself, he is no longer a complete lion, nor is he a complete man.
In the end, only the back of the little lion, I don't know where he went.
Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion is still in the impression of a grown-up child, remembered when he is inadvertently, and may be touched or inspired by her.
A very cost-effective portfolio.
1, before I do not know TASCHEN, recently bought a lot of their books, the reason is too strong, whether it is the choice of the topic or the production itself.
There have been three versions of the book, the largest version and the full collection of the Michelangelo, are close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the middle version is about 36 cm long 23 cm wide; this version is the smallest, and with a book box of two books.
Personally, I think it is acceptable, one is cheap, and more than 700 pages are divided into two, as a paperback is also better to read; second, it is different from the full collection of Michelangelo, the painting occupies the main body, da Vinci this black and white manuscript accounted for the majority, for the budget-limited, non-art professional readers, this version as to appreciate the painting and the manuscript is the most cost-effective.
The interpretation of the painting part is great, there is composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the last dinner), but I do not know whether it is printing or book size problem, some shaded part of the county is too deep, can not see the details, a little regret.
Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo's manuscripts are much richer.
The former is already a genius, and the latter is far-reaching and highly accomplished, not enough for genius to describe.
If you used to only look at the painting and only experience half of Leonardo da Vinci, after reading the manuscript, it will be completely out of language.
Rubbish, who buys who regrets!
Never give bad comments, this sincere garbage, buy a waste of money Shenma, give a reason!
When you go, it is not allowed, suddenly it becomes January 1st, and the time is zero.
Poor-quality belt, not silicone, with wrist allergic foaming.
Often can't connect to a mobile phone.
It only lasts for five days.
Sleep detection does not show, the time is 0.
6, not waterproof.
7. Other.
Logistics is too slow.
Showing October 16th, the result 21 was received, bad review!
The delivery is too bad, Amazon shopping is already slow, I did not expect to be so slow!
Overall Satisfaction
Before the beginning is also worried about the camera packaging, this time is good, there is an inflatable bag, the camera three code is the same, can also be registered on the official website, the number of shutters 0, the rest can only wait for time to test.
The delivery speed is quite fast, here Tucao courier brother, valuable items are placed in the door, go fast, I can not open the box inspection in front of him, this is really speechless.
The business did the customer's thought before shipping :)
Merchants are more responsible, specifically call to ask the screen size of the camera used, it is indeed for the customer to think.
The delivery speed is also fast.
The taped on the film is also very suitable and useful.
Battery is not satisfied.
The machine is really good, I want to ask how to charge for the first time when you are dissatisfied, the charging indicator has always been red.
At present, we can't find Amazon's official feedback channel, so it can only be reported in the product evaluation.
On March 29, the book was purchased using 31 yuan through pre-order, showing that the March 31st will be pushed to the device, at which time the book cannot be previewed on Amazon's official website (because it has not yet been released);
2. March 31st pushed to the device of the book, the content is blank, only please wait, and Amazon on the book electronic version priced to 18 yuan;
These two days have repeatedly tried to delete the downloaded blank book on the device, and synchronized again, and can not get an electronic version of "Essence of Commerce" containing the actual content, but see that Amazon's official website can already preview the book.
I have a few thoughts now.
The price problem is not the most important thing, the key is how to replace the blank book on the Kindle with the actual content of the book, rather than always download it is "stay tuned"
Pre-purchased books should not be bought again, after all, in case of jump ticket, and then download an empty content of the book, the formalities look very complicated;
I hope that Amazon can give a normal channel that can feedback such problems, and when you ask questions about e-book downloads or use, you can have local feedback (work orders, online customer service can, you can refer to how Microsoft's official mall is done).
Not very recommended to read.
I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it by writing a little after reading it from memory.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories, but rather a collection of fragments of love in life.
The tone of this book is extremely dull, is the kind of white water as bland, the words are pursued to the extreme of simplicity, and the plot is also like the street in the afternoon of summer, the silence is flat.
Each short story is a silhouette of a short period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no ending.
Finally collected together, the title “What We’re Talking About When We Talk About Love.”
I think, this collection of novels, and its title, like a kind of performance art, the author wants to express that love is not only the sadness and joy on the stage, the sea withered stone in urban legend, not only you are like glue, love is not only the above should not be represented, love is also a plain life, boring day after day, there is also a lack of help for life, the escape of reality, the future.
When reading this book, your mind may recall the quarreling couple next to you, the tasteless marriage of people you know, and the unpleasant feelings.
This is why I do not recommend reading, from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are tasteless, unless your life is as scary or sweet as living in the candy castle, otherwise you have to read the feeling is not surprising and boring.
From the depth of thought, the daily plot does not make people shine or expand a person's thinking and vision (this is different from Márquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short clip does not explore any problems, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?
The breakdown of the protagonist's marriage comes from those reasons.
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much sense to read it.
The author's ideas are expressed more through techniques and genres than through the storyline, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience in this book.
Suitable for rough reading, can not look.
The logic of the book is good, but the content is not full enough.
Explaining what a lot of sales theory is and why, but it is weak in how to do it, but it points out the direction but does not give a specific approach.
In addition, the book feels like a patchwork.
Examples include both domestic and foreign; there are well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and lesser-known people.
I don't know if it's a story compiled for example, if you give some examples of the author's own experience will be more convincing.
Change in the name of the customer or the customer.
The title is still the customer, and the text becomes the customer.
There are also problems with typos, missing punctuation, and errors in the numbering of e-books.
In short, this book is a good choice as a theoretical introduction, but it is not suitable for people who are already engaged in sales work to improve sales.
Quick understanding of Internet finance guide reading
This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is just an introductory class, which can help everyone quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to understand more deeply, it is still necessary to dig deep by trying to go deep.
And the book time is earlier, later Alipay WeChat through the subsidy war to cultivate the user's habits of the content has not been mentioned, now the third-party payment share is afraid is not the book said the proportion of such a small.
Now a lot of people go out to eat is good to bring a mobile phone, businesses also because the bank is too high reasons, abandoned UnionPay.
But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book, which shows that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such an easy-to-understand content.
It is easy to write high and empty, and it is difficult to write easily.
Admire you, I want you to know!
The first factor in determining a person’s job satisfaction is not the salary level, but whether they are given enough attention and appreciation at work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the most urgent thing after the basic survival needs of man are met is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the hope is understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for the people of the country, most of them are "love you in the heart is difficult to open", even if you have love, gratitude and appreciation is silent in the heart will not say.
In this book, the author describes five languages of appreciation: affirmative words, careful moments, acts of service, gifts of heart, and physical contact.
I think it is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages to appreciate and be grateful to those around you, whether it is family, friends or colleagues, anytime, anywhere.
In fact, the more intimate people need appreciation and gratitude, so that our lives will become better.
Learn to appreciate that enterprises can also retain talents to a certain extent, reducing the resignation rate.
Thank you to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign ideas and the world.
For reasons such as the cultural background of China and the West, there will be more or less differences between languages, and if you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, you will gain more.
Thank you again for the hard work of the authors and translators and the editors!
Suspected of fake and shoddy goods, please Amazon strictly review
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, no weight, even less than the roadside stall product, no weight, no bar code, ten bags of packaging is also loose, not the characteristics of qualified products; is Amazon's worst shopping experience, has applied for return; it is a matter of quality; it is recommended that the merchant polishes its eyes and refuses to inferior goods; supplement: and buys the heart print, the supermarket 23 yuan / 10 volume, and adds several contrasting photos, further verifying the fake and shoddy of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference.
Once again, I hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strict with the source of the goods.
There is a gap between sloppy products and expectations
Advantages:
Big brands, cheap.
Advantage 2: The motor and the blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and it is also OK to use, but there is a gap with my expectations.
Disadvantages:
Charging no indicator, this most basic your power indicator has been saved, it is estimated that customers who buy 300 yuan of products, in the eyes of Panasonic, are also alms, without respect.
When charging, even if it is only charging for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of plastic burning.
The office tried for one day, and the whole house was made with this plastic taste.
Compared with the Philips Philips I have used before, although there is more than a knife, but Panasonic this product, the quality is really sorry to consumers.
Small packaging
Received a look at the express on the e-commerce version to know that it fell into the pit, smaller than the supermarket to buy, it should be M, and the above picture packaging is not the same as the introduction of goods, the so-called new version of it.
Three stars is to blame their own sloppy did not see the product specifications, you sell M code e-commerce version I have no problem, your goods wrong version is how much?
The e-commerce routine is deep, and there is still time to go to the supermarket to buy.
The sauce is purple.
The smell doesn't like it.
Children do not like the taste of toothpaste, every time they say spicy, perhaps with other words to describe more apt, the child's thesory in the temporary only word.
When you buy it, it is very cheap, so I am embarrassed to give a bad review, four stars, but I will not buy it again.
The original packaging.
The packaging is very complete, with an inflatable bag added inside, and only the appearance of a bare product without online reviews.
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, as described in the picture, and the courier is also very fast, and the next day comes.
It's genuine, it's just no goods, I don't know when to go on the shelf again.
A bad shopping experience.
The black five time the order, the result waited for a long time did not receive, behind a query, the package has long been signed, asked colleagues around them said no help to sign, hurry to contact the courier, but said to send the party to launch an inquiry, contact Amazon customer service, and wait for more than ten days, finally figuring out that the courier was mistakenly cast to others, and then several turnovers to finally retrieve the courier, the outer packaging has been removed, the goods are still complete, do not know that it has not been used, it is not bad.
The wrong map.
I thought that I could receive headphones such as Figure 1, I did not expect to receive such headphones as Figure 2, the picture is inconsistent, even if the sketphones are different in the size of the left and right sound?
Although the name is the same, but I still hope you can pay attention carefully, but also ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct drawing in time, thank you.
Operating system in general.
It took a while, in general, the picture can be, can not feel any difference, that is, the system makes people look tangled, the boot time is obviously a little slow, can not be a good setting, and then bring the software is not to comment, the response speed is more general, compared with colleagues is not an order of magnitude.
Looking at the comment that the design is very humane, I can't find any humanization, the remote control is commonly used up and down, the location of the return key design is really not flatter.
So, just be a TV, plus a TV box and so on.
The price is too high.
The price is too good, more than a hundred now 99!
I have accumulated a lot of unevaluated orders at Amazon, so I used a copy of the paragraph as the evaluation content.
If I use this statement to evaluate, it means that this product is at least 85 points.
And the worse products, I will never be lazy to copy and paste evaluation, so that other consumers will use it as a reference when buying, and the business will also improve the quality of the goods.
Low price, good line, no fever is enough!
Such a cheap line, but it should have reached the HDMI certification standard, personally compared to kill the domestic Akihabara these bullshit (the price is twice as expensive), the line is strong, but also relatively soft, 7 meters transmission without noise, after the low price line to consider!
Things are okay, but Amazon’s after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, it was found that the wrong, but the cancellation of the order has been cancelled, the web page contact online customer service has been showing the wrong link, can not contact.
After the delivery, the deliveryman called me, I said I don't want to, I want to cancel the order did not cancel the success, the sender took it back, said first to me sign and receive, let me apply for a return.
When applying for a return, you are told that the food category cannot be returned once it is signed, and it is impossible to call Amazon customer service, which is also said, and the signature cannot be returned.
I have previously bought items that cannot be returned in the policy in Jingdong and Suning, including milk, diapers, etc., and the contact customer service has been returned, and the taste of Jingdong's diapers is too much to contact the customer service, and you can't.
The rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?
Tell me either I take it myself, or let the sender buy it by himself, it is not easy for people to send the staff, why should I let people pay for things that are not bought by themselves?
Well, I didn't give up either, I took it myself, but I had to give your service a point.
Tell everyone not to spend money in vain.
First of all, full of expectations to buy, feel that the Dole brand should not be bad to go to, received later to see the packaging feel good, a good head, but there is a box basically soft, the appearance is not visible, to feel, eat to the mouth completely tasteless, light tasteless, biting the flesh is dark yellow is broken that, good or bad to sell, can eat less than one-third, advise everyone not to buy, not cheap, the quality is too poor!
Eat a piece of wisdom, and never buy fruit in the electricity supplier again!
Where are the anti-counterfeiting labels of products?
The bottom of the bottle a corner of the depression, should have experienced a strong impact can be caused, from the outer packaging bag to see, feel the degree of ravage is heart-wrenching, after all, is the food packaging is too simple, but also belongs to the international purchase, there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting logo, open the bottle is very easy, the key is the cover of a layer of honey directly out of the inside, there is almost no adhesion, foreign products are like this?
I don’t understand living in China.
It must be genuine, right?
There is also a reminder when the 20th to the 24th, this is the 14th received, I bought here for the first time, just write down your doubts, maybe this is normal?
Pick-up services need to be improved
I bought a total of 5 pick-up coupons, in the extraction, the first appointment to withdraw 3, the result is only sent to 2, after multiple communication to confirm that it is missed, agree to need to be re-sented; the second appointment, just in time to catch the rest day, the website and WeChat are not prompted to make an appointment on the working day, resulting in unnecessary panic, it is recommended to improve later.
Good shopping.
Something well-received!
Or more believe in Amazon's own things, now after overseas shopping is very convenient, from abroad to buy back logistics time than the domestic will be a few days, I have to say that Amazon overseas to buy to the domestic customs clearance ability is still very strong, much faster than the transfer, so now a lot of things are purchased overseas.
It is hoped that the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, and many things are produced domestically, but it is cheaper to go out and buy it around than in China, and hope to improve.
Rubbish
Seeing such a package, ask everyone: do you feel like it is roadside garbage?
A plastic fragile packaging, with a plastic bag from the so-called Germany, such a packaging is responsible?
I think such packaging is the same as garbage, buy this product, packaging and its rudimentary, without any measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after hand, the package is completely deformed, the contents of the items are also damaged.
If I just came across one like this, I recognized, bought a few are like this, find Amazon customer service, customer service said you can refund, but the freight advance, and then the freight in the form of a gift card back to me.
I'll ask, I pay the freight with cash, you give me the gift card, this is to buy your gift card to say directly, but also to mail the product to the German warehouse, this is not to buy a product suffer ah!
And I have been to the customer service to say that such a problem is who is responsible, customer service is half a sentence does not say is their responsibility, even half a responsibility is not dare to bear, such after-sales service what is the guarantee?
Good quality 5 stars, poor logistics
1, the quality is very good, the second kill, the price is moderate, the value of the good value.
2, strong, with material feet, solder joints are firm, the surface is properly treated, and the color is very good.
3, logistics is hard injury, 3 under the order, 11 to.
If Amazon does not indicate that the expected delivery time is February 7, I may be satisfied.
5, but the marked expected arrival time is equivalent to giving the user a commitment, when the promise can not be fulfilled, the user is very uncomfortable.
If you are not sure of a commitment, please do not make a commitment.
In fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by the merchant.
8, so I scored low.
The gold line will fade.
There are still some effects, but whether the feeling is obvious depends on the individual, or psychological effect.
A little bit is not good, that is, the golden line, originally designed to feel good, but in fact, this gold line will fade, put in the car, if you take a few times, hands, and the car, there will be some gold powder.
I hope the product can be improved.
This kind of square, there is no decorative effect, do not engage in the gold line, fall down in the car to get dirty car is also trouble.
Things are intact, speed can, divided into 2 packages and different packaging
8 days the speed is quite fast, but it is 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, the packaging is still different, obviously a shock-proof too much, thick cardboard pasted, sealed layers of plastic, outer packaging is also convenient to disassemble, a domestic express box, put a few buffer airbags even if it is a little perfunctory.
Jalan mattress is really good.
The mattress of 34CM is not generally thick, and the mattress can be slept directly in the bed.
The quality is very good, whether it is on the front or the back, it is very soft, the sleep is very comfortable, lying on it and soon fall asleep.
After receiving the mattress because of the express violence transport there are two some stains, Yalan customer service is very responsible, very efficient contact to solve the problem.
It's not self-operated goods, Amazon is shameless.
The page is clearly marked self-operated, in fact, by the supplier of distribution, after-sales by the supplier responsible, the problem to contact the supplier.
Want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, can not cancel; want to return the goods, in Amazon successfully applied for return, sorry, no one to ignore you, you need to contact the supplier to return.
This Nima is a self-operated commodity.
The goods are not Amazon delivery, after-sales Amazon does not bear, the customer service even said "I help you contact the supplier", but also claimed to be self-operated, too shameless, naked shameless, naked fraud against consumers!
A depressing experience.
Before the filter element purchased online in other homes, the filtration effect is good, and there is no scale for one or two days after the end of 28 days.
Because the quality of what has been purchased in Amazon can be, this time I want to buy it here, the first time I bought a filter on Amazon, I don't feel very good, not only began to have scale early, but also the filter has been used for the 28th day, there will be suspended small black toner, I really don't know if it continues to be used, or directly tossed it, very depressed~
Not as good as imagined.
Compared with the plug-in boards I have used in the past, the external workmanship is general, how the inside is not opened, and I hope that as described by the store, from the point of view of convenience, whether each independent unit is energized and lacks display.
The packaging is broken, waiting for time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is more serious, the box inside seems to be new, but the manual seems to be not new, September decoration, hoarding, hope that the time will not be bad, please explain Amazon why several customers mention the packaging damage, you can safely, thank you!
Overall good, a little problem.
The first time to buy a water filter pot, read a few evaluation articles, feel that LAICA's cost-effective choice, received the goods according to the instructions installed filter, try a little, feel generally good, but when pouring water, it seems that the raw water will be mixed from the place of the pot mouth and the treated water (the original water storage is not very strict).
When used, you must wait for all the water to be filtered and poured out!
The picture is incomplete.
The picture does not take the details of the side, the details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body, which is very different, this is one; this bead is produced in Thailand, there is no indication of the origin, this is the second; no indication of the texture, this is the third; when I bought in England, I clearly found that each one has a box, here is only a simple plastic bag, and the beads do not have any product logo above, where I can judge whether it is true or false.
Buy carefully, especially buy out of Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service is terrible.
Two days ago, the order, received today found that the drop of 40 yuan, spent a lot of time to find customer service, customer service said can not make up the difference, you can buy and return.
This kind of customer experience and service is really ten thousand times worse than a treasure.
As a newbie, it’s worth it.
The taste is good, and the goods are not comparable to the goods, before I saw the price of the mall, less to say hundreds of times, I was the first time to play King Kong, OK.
Something good.
Things are really good, send girlfriend, but at noon I am not in the delivery of some unpleasant, the logistics company directly put the mail deposit treasure and did not send a copy of the verification text message to me, causing me to run two times.
But baby is really good.
Worth buying.
The little monkey is cute, the Amazon offer is really strong, Zhou Shengsheng official website directly shipped, the night before the order, received this afternoon, really fast.
The postal courier is also in charge.
Oh, and praise!
Confessions of a customer.
1 Receive such a scrap, Amazon customer service told you do not hurry ah, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then you contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that the problem will be handled by the commissioner, he will tell you the results.
You will never be able to contact this commissioner, you will never know her work number, there is no direct contact phone, you can not contact her, only she contact you.
The tragedy was that after waiting for nearly three days, the commissioner contacted me, and I left my mobile phone for a while without receiving a call from the commissioner.
I waited two hours and didn’t wait for the commissioner’s call, during which I contacted Amazon customer service and emailed her to get her to call me back.
In the past 3 days, I don't know what the results of Amazon's coffee machine that I received for this defective product!
There is no problem with Amazon's goods in the United States, and it is good to buy this kind of shopping overseas, but it is far worse than the service to the United States and Asia.
6 For me, I can only wait...
Inflated
Because the review is very good, all the pot is very expected, get the hand is also very like, very light, but when the pot is opened, found that the problem, the bottom of the pot is not flat, the middle protrusion, the surrounding concave, the oil is run to the surrounding, specially bought the open pot of large fat meat fried a lot of oil can not cover the central area, paste, open the pot can not open, such a structure can not be normal cooking.
I don't know if I was unlucky, just got a bad pot, fortunately Amazon provided a month of return service, decisively refunded.
I brushed the pot cleanly and retreated, and was busy for half a day.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve
This is a very simple design product.
The shape of the cube, the designer treats the top into a slight arc.
It should have been a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.
Because there are two parts on the top, the front is the control panel, and the back of the water box top cover.
The curvance of the top cover and the curvance of the control panel are actually inconsistent, and after the combination, a high difference of about 2mm is present.
It looks like a small gap.
But it can be said that the whole design sense has been destroyed.
I love that product designer.
It seems that the product manager of the beautiful is not yet able to build such a level of product.
(Of course, the feedback of the after-sales lady can not be too high, but when I heard the after-sales said that all the individuals of this product are like this, not only I bought this problem, her disapproval and solid burden-bearing mood let me understand that the beauty can not be too high) 2019-7-7 pump failure water loss, has been the second maintenance, the first maintenance two weeks after the broken.
After the discount is very cost-effective, Amazon fake discount is very sad
The baby was born a week to buy, super insulated.
The outside of the pot can not touch a trace of heat, that is, not afraid of burning people can also effectively protect the temperature without spreading.
After one night the air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon said that the anniversary activities of 320 major offers, and later found that everyone 249, 289, 299 have, there is a sense of deception in an instant, but to the supermarket compared to a variety of miscellaneous cards are still more than the same price, the future can go out with the car to carry.
Vitamix 6300
It has been a long time to wait and see the US and Asia 6300 discount, Central Asia overseas purchase of the same price, hurry to start.
September 2nd order, the expected goods are the 21st, the result of the 12th arrived, almost 10 days in advance, the speed is really fast!
The box is not large, directly using the original packaging of Vitamix, Amazon is not afraid to break across the sea!
The machine looks very new, the accessories are complete, that is, the cup is swung on the base, I am afraid to open the cup directly out!
Ask a friend who has 5,200 and listen to him describe it as if it were so loose without me.
Random accompanying recipes in full English, very tired to see, online did not find the Chinese version, this is a trouble!
After receiving the goods, quickly buy a transformer, it is estimated that you can come in 3 days, and then toss it well!
Too small, no umbrella, general material.
Not at all big!
The second Totes, 1. This does not have an umbrella sleeve 2. Umbrella handle material is generally 3. obviously write Large, in fact, is a convenient umbrella for one person, two people with an estimate enough.
Instead, the one that I bought in Meia before was able to use three people without pressure.
It doesn't feel good.
First of all, the box is not very strong, with a click on the deformation, followed by the back of the design of the flat to prevent the box of ABS scratching and can not play a role, and once again is the box inside is a cloth wrapped, pull the bar place highlighted out... and so on, all kinds of dissatisfaction, and finally the zipper is a little smooth.
PS: The wheels feel really good.
It can also
Advantages: This shoulder bag is more delicate and looks durable.
Disadvantages: the two-dimensional code on the card can not be scanned (what the hell), 15.6 inches of notebook can not be put down (and a little longer can do it), this shoulder bag zip can be locked up, but not for the buyer to prepare a lock, can not be described as service first.
The whole thing is okay, I don't know if it's real skin.
The overall feeling is okay, do not know whether it is the leather, can not be blindly evaluated.
Can be installed A4 file, installed 80 pages thick, but too thick and too hard box-shaped objects (can not be deformed) estimated to be installed.
The bag is very soft, and the inner bag separation is also more human, which is quite good.
It's just that I have a little garbath at the bottom of this, I don't know if it's a bad person or not?
Don't bother to turn back and forth, endure.
A total of four stars, or worth it.
ForRoyal Popular Global Camera SLR Backband
This strap is designed to be more scientific, hanging shoulders, practical, and the chest is fixed with soft materials and protect the camera, unlike other fast gunners with screws to fix the bottom of the camera, and it is very convenient to take off the photography.
After the sale of garbage
I bought the piano a month and a half ago, the lack of parts, after notifying Amazon gave me a call after the sale, after many times after communication, the parts have not yet received, what is the efficiency!
Estimated after the problem maintenance more troublesome, look forward to good after-sales friends or detour, too much trouble!
Small flaws, good sound.
The head is defective, there is a horn, the feeling is a defective product, and there is no gift, but this price is already good, and the sound of the piano is also good.
All right, first line.
It took a long time, except for the low voice, which was generally good.
Work is not as perfect as you think.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with everything, and all the lights were flashing and couldn’t be used.
Ask for a change of goods, the result of the goods arrived in Shanghai for three days, but also did not send.
The phone call to the delivery is also not answered.
The delivery company said they only had that contact information.
Amazon could not find a place to complain.
Without having requested, delayed delivery in the case of inexplicable as I asked for delayed delivery – such a text message came over.
What is the turning point later?
Anyway, the very poor shopping experience began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
I don’t think we’ll get it today either.
The label is too sticky and not waterproof.
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, but the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not laminating; and the label stickiness is very poor, for cable labels are not good at all, it is very easy to fall off, buy to organize the cable friends need to pay attention to.
The pen is okay, but the package is too simple, just a paper box, no protective measures, and the pen box with a large piece of transparent glue glue glue, tearing off the glue are on the box.
Six hundred dollars of things are treated like this, very disappointed in a shopping.
But the pen is no problem.
I hope to improve the packaging later!
Quality does not say, if you talk about writing, it is better than 925-25
First of all, praise the daily express, air parts, super fast, the service attitude is also very good!
I have been using 925-25, very good, just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is not said, the style is also very beautiful, the reason why the four stars are given is because the pen is a little heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap adjusts the length of the lead core at a little shake, personal opinion: 925-25 is more handy than 85.
So it became Amazon's dead powder.
Super good prices to buy, the result children do not like to read pen.
Unpacked, try to apply for a return, actually free to pick up.
Too much cow.
Returns are not recommended, but such a service is the only one in China.
I hope it is not abused.
Later, the books were moved to buy here.
Headphones, and noises.
This headset is really garbage, I don't know if there is a problem with my ear, or this headset is not as good as before.
I bought a blue one two years ago, the sound quality is not bad, no noise bass is also good, used for more than two years to break the intention to buy another (urbeats), after all, feel good.
I saw a purple look, and I bought this today to open a listening to feel wrong, and the voice was loud and small.
At first I thought it was the sound of the song because I didn't think much about it, but then after listening to it for half a day, I found that the problem was very serious, not only polarized, the bass effect was not as good as I had before, and there was a little noise, was it only I bought this purple phenomenon?
Very bad assessment, very disappointing.
Must be returned tomorrow during the day.
PS is good.
This AV amplifier is set up complex, the appearance is rough, and the heat is large.
The sound will take a while to review!
August 14 just started the German version of DN1080, look at the work outside the poor.
The front panel and the knob are all plastic.
The rear board audio input socket, the speaker output terminals are poor, just look for a 1000-2000 CD amplifier machine is much better than this.
The top cover is relatively thin, my transformer is still recessed, had to open the box to restore by hand, the top cover and the front panel combined loose.
The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased towards the end of the transformer, and it is very awkward when moving.
It feels like a Sony entry-level machine, just the workmanship, produced in Malaysia.
It feels that Sony has to put a better job in China than the pony.
The machine is hot, watching the movie with two channels for about 2 hours or so the top cover with a hand to touch it is 40-50 °C, I do not know whether the transformer is too large to generate heat.
Now use more switching power supply, this stupid transformer is estimated to have 4KG.
Sony should use an active heat dissipation mute fan in the machine, and only see the large aluminum plate heat sink on the tube after opening the box.
Small expensive

Not opened.
The battery is in use.
I’d love to do it and see what’s in his stomach.
Later, think about it, if you are very disappointed after the opening, it will be too wrong to spend so much money; if you are satisfied after the opening, it will be difficult to install again, and it will not be cool to use.
Even if Sony is using a good battery.
As for the detailed description of the electricity, the average person will look at the heart will be fictitious.
I am still good, I have worked in the mobile phone factory for a long time, in addition to not understanding the circuit, but also half of the battery engineer, can withstand.
Overjoyed.
There is really no bottom in my heart before buying, until you open the package and feel very good!
Finally, when I touched the headset cable, I felt particularly flexible and of great quality, and I couldn’t wait to plug in the QQ music on my phone.
I was surprised that the sound quality was surrounded by 3D three-dimensional!
I asked in the physical communication store, almost 30 or so, but by no means the winning brand, is a miscellaneous brand, so say this win although 27, but the price is definitely worth having!
The worst online shopping experience.
After the order was placed on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, and the result was that it did not receive the goods until October 12.
Enquiry about the status of Amazon orders, the seller did not provide the courier number, can not find where the order is.
So an email was sent to the seller asking if he could provide a courier number, and there was no reply for two days.
In desperation, called Amazon customer service, customer service told the seller's mobile phone number, I called the store again, after a few times, the phone was spoke, was told that the courier lost, you can immediately send me one again.
Although I was particularly angry, due to the urgent need of the computer, I did not say more to the seller, as long as it was immediately sent to me.
The next day, I called and asked, did you ship it?
The seller said no, so he could not send it in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon to ask, the seller said must send, shipped after five or six in the afternoon, the result is waiting for me to call at 7 p.m., the phone will no one answer.
On the morning of the third day, I hit again and asked if the goods were sent out?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said no, told me if I was in a hurry to order from another home, if I could wait for the afternoon.
I can’t wait a long time for an order from another home.
Ask the seller to ship quickly.
After a lot of phone follow-up, I received my computer on October 16.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because it was bought for others, and then add comments later.
Just bought six months did not use a few times, now the contact is not good, ask can you repair?
Because there is a desktop, I have not used it many times after buying it.
Just take a few times in the fashion bag for business trip.
Recently found to be on the power supply, do not charge, need to hand around a few charger and line connection, in order to charge.
Suspect is that the interface is in poor contact, I do not know if I can still repair it now?
Amazon is strongly encouraged to stop using EMS!
Five stars, one star for logistics, an average of three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon wants to send EMS, the industry is recognized as unreliable, well, the computer is also a valuable item!
After the purchase of the order, it is expected to arrive on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
Send from Xiamen to Fuzhou, why four or five days!
On the morning of the 22nd, the logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, ready to collect the goods happily, as a result, in the evening without any phone calls, text messages, a check logistics, even at noon was signed and received, but also showed my signature!
I was instantly shocked!
Where am I? is this computer really I bought?
Doubts about life?
I finally ran a collection point to move the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier brother reversed the two single numbers, but even if it was not lost in the piece.
I strongly recommend that Amazon not use EMS, and if Amazon sends couriers with EMS, I will definitely not buy them again.
Good goods.
First of all, just bought a few days to find the price reduction, bad reviews, it is still good, cost-effective, CPU and graphics card enough to cope with the mainstream online game and a considerable part of the single machine, heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little light (ips screen pass disease), the sound quality is not good, the hard disk is not good (recommended to spend a little money plus a solid state), yesterday to take the after-sales detection of the hardware, no problem, the win8.1 is not very easy to use, it is recommended to upgrade to 10, the seller.
(By the way, buy a keyboard film must not go to a treasure called E cool digital center store to buy, the delivery of slow quality is poor, the product has problems do not change, the boss is still full of dirty words, especially exposure )
Things are fine, the platform bureaucrats are still
The hard disk quality is very good, the price/performance ratio is absolutely high, cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, and it is definitely recommended to buy if you are not in a hurry to use and be able to tolerate logistics.
But I have to say that the Amazon platform bureaucrat is still, and a few years ago I swear absolutely did not use the time did not improve, you will never find the actual logistics situation, information will always be sent in a few weeks, can never complain, is such a bureaucrate!
The goods have been received for a few days, and the logistics information is still 10 days away, and you will receive the goods in 10 days!
Logistics is not easy.
Send it this way, not only the packaging is flattened, the electrical packaging is also open, and I do not know whether there is a transfer package.
FYI
There is no trial, always trust Philips, and hope that the battery life is longer than other brands.
Check the Internet, it may be a problem with water, and there is no warranty.
Depressed!
Now wrap the cling film continues to use, I don't know how long it can be used?
Buy someone else to open it.
More than 300 machines to more than 100 more taxes are indeed relatively high, look now more than 600 hearts more balanced.
When received when the sealing adhesive strip state look very wrong, as if opened, quickly took a picture, really torn open, open the inside of the cardboard and damage, worried that others retreated, before the anniversary, hurry to the husband to try, the result machine did not have any electricity, good knife inside there is no slag, to not much long back ah!
Good to use or short-term will not have any problems is unknown, such as the previous evaluation, out of stock when the things are indeed not reliable!
Experience is on the upper level.
Almost the top electric, there are many kinds of cleaning mode, but few people will change different mode brush every day.
It took six months without any problems, brushing every day, almost one more Monday rush.
Brush head accessories are equally cheap to buy on Amazon.
App is a little difficult to use, in addition to changing the color of those, other seemingly compatible questions are the reason for the overseas version?
I want to learn the law.
Cost-effectively
It has been used 3-4 times.
1) Packed well.
2, the use is very simple, cleaning is also very convenient.
3, can completely DIY haircut, save money.
A very successful purchase.
There are fakes.
The last time I bought two bags, it was actually two different versions, the original packaging on the bottom left corner of the word is green, the result is a bag is not, is a white word, the result of the cat eating the stomach.
Whether Amazon's supply is fake, or the employee's bag is dropped when shipping, I can't be sure.
I will buy it again, and if it is still a fake, I will seek responsibility for your relevant people.
It's a crossover!
The Amazon picture is slashed, and the result is a crossbar for me, isn't that a lie?
The effect is okay.
Cats like to eat, that’s the point.
It is also effective.
Tight, narrow, hoop feet, grinding feet.
Not recommended.
UN is the most comfortable series in Clarks, but this one is too bad.
Added: Today compared the previous UN series insoles (shoes thrown in the pad to keep), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, breathable is not as good as before, is fake soft.
My foot is not high, and the part of the kung fu is about 3 centimeters forward at the highest point on the back of the foot.
Three pairs of clarks were purchased overseas, and only one pair was suitable.
It scared me to cut the music from my collection.
Try Rockport back, you can't just go to the Ecco physical store.
In order to do well, the quality control is not good.
First of all, it is worth being sure that Prime overseas purchases of Ups are very powerful, and the single 6 number under the 31st is received.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the cortex feels good.
The shoe size is a little larger, the 25 feet are 10.5 wide and 7.5W, the upper foot is a little loose, but usually like to wear looser, a pair of insoles just right.
Secondly, this shoe quality control really dare not compliment, one shoe sole glue is damaged, another shoe has a variety of scratches and a needle eye, the upper and soles are connected to the glue strip misplaced, clearly placed in the supper shop shode!
A little regret!
Buy it for $280 for the event, and it's quite cost-effective to buy Arthurs at this price, and of course there are lower prices for reviews.
Now say the shoes, the advantages: the shoes are very light, running is very comfortable, but also more fit, will not loose down.
The face value is high, but the shortcomings are also obvious: I generally wear 40 shoes, this time the 40.5, wear the front of the shoes there is about a thumb distance, but this does not affect anything.
The shoe is very "narrow", although there is still a distance in front, but it feels tight.
Another point, the shoes may not be very good, now wear feel the feet are very hot.
Feet-pressed back
First of all, the shoes are very good, worth the price.
My feet are very standard kind, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, Amazon's love steps have also bought a few pairs, there have never been a bad pair, but this pair of I refer to the comment, buy the big one uk7, after the foot because the size of the size is obviously long, but because the insole is too thick, or the weight of the foot back pressure, coupled with hiking shoes is very hard, resulting in the upper foot is very uncomfortable.
If your feet are not particularly thin, it is not recommended to buy this one.
If you must buy, change the insole can also be solved, but the original insole looks very high-end, no need to be a pity.
Perfect for a shopping trip!
Very satisfied, very much like, Amazon overseas purchase is not doubtable, quality is also very good, good quality and low price, buy rest assured, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very kind and kind, deal with the problem patiently and efficient, perfect to solve the worries, the supporting express delivery door is very convenient and safe, the delivery master is very convenient and safe, delivery master is very for the customer's sake, every time will remind the timely pick-up from the express cabinet, thank Amazon to provide customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In short, our whole family likes to buy shopping overseas at Amazon!
Absolutely bad review!
This agency is very speechless to this agency and Amazon.
After that, electronic products will be bought on Amazon or be careful.
Although it has been a long time, it is still coming to spit.
Winter seconds to buy, less than 200, placed at home for a few months useless.
When it is necessary to use in the spring, it is found that the bracelet is not even connected, and the two equipment instructions are in support of each other, and later it is found that it should be a problem of the heart rate band, because the other equipment can not be connected.
Call Amazon, let me contact the agency, the agency asked me to send the device to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, the thing was sent back by the original, and even the express box was the one I used when I sent it!
No responses or receipts or test reports!
Tell me if it’s good or bad!
Call to ask, say this to send back to say that the equipment is no problem, it is good.
But how can I still not be connected, the agency replied: that is not their business.
I'm too unlucky to be tossed by you for a 200 dollar thing.
Serious goods are wrong.
Very bad thing about the board.
The headband material is very good.
Much better than Nike.
Breathability is also good.
Just the hat in front.
Very fine.
Do you want to make fun of it?!
Completely unscorn the sun.
Not returning because it is a good headband function.
Wear it up, but you can't cover the sun.
But it is different from other headband styles.
Keep it used.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks the spirit of contract, and the deliveryman is very good.
I asked for a Saturday and Sunday delivery!
Amazon rules do not allow deliveries on Saturdays and Sundays.
It hurts me to drive 200 kilometers from the field to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery staff was very active and enthusiastic.
Give it a compliment!
Good thing, a simple try, good.
But I have not bought similar products before, and I can't compare prices!
Size Logistics
Work can also, that is, the logistics is too slow, the previous shoes are DHL, this Apex is really... domestic buy a lot of UA, the price is not low, feel engaged in higher than NIKE ADIDAS grade?
It’s all the same, so it’s all good.
Size: I am 176CM, 68KG, my shoulders are wide clothes are 180, buy M, the hem is slightly longer, the other wear just right, I think there is a recommended S code, the body is so slim?
The size is just right.
Bust 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, before the purchase of the customer service was told should buy xxl, and then read the comments decisively to start L, after receiving the goods found that the size is just right, almost was pitted.
The price of the double eleven is much more expensive than the black five.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
Z affordable goods problem is very troublesome!
The order under the 18th, the goods received on the 25th, the speed of Guangzhou to Beijing snail!
Buy is Z affordable goods, the instructions are told that there are scratches, but after receiving the goods, you find that there are 4 screws and nuts!
The child is not willing to return, think of the problem is not big, but the accessories of this small part, the child's grandfather ran away near several hardware stores did not buy!
Grandpa finally stuck!
It seems that you can't buy Z's affordable goods again!
The quality of toy processing is not good.
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, the bolts are very laborious, you can see that the processing quality is not good, and do not know how long you can play, because the broid is the child's promise of things, will not retreat.
Other comments said that the installation is not difficult, is there only a problem with this one I bought?
Very general
Was I not lucky?
The packaging is old enough; the workmanship is very ordinary; the music is only one and only 8 seconds long and then repeated; the action is to shake the head from the way forward, without any change.
Not worth the price.
Hurry up and don’t return it.
The quality of the toys is good, Tucao packaging
Yesterday received the courier, Amazon bought, marked is the EMS delivery, and finally the Tmall courier sent, this is how many turns?
Put another package, is to wrap a few layers with plastic wrap, even a packaging plastic bubble paper does not, open a look, all the parts are placed in an empty box, good toy quality is good, no broken parts, is much smaller than the imagination, because not with the battery, hand push often derailed, feel the track on both sides of the gap is too large, unreasonable design.
Good quality, fun.
It is fun, the components are very accurate, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is about the same as Lego, and the price is very favorable when doing activities.
The process of putting together is very interesting, I come to fight, 5-year-old son to play, very good.
He was laughing and probably would continue to buy this brand of toys.
The machine is new, the sea is good.
Christmas has been looked down, before the purchase of 150 yuan, but now the delivery is a little slower.
The machine is still good, it's all quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then the words that connect the elves ball will send a dream.
It’s better than the PS4, and it’s more portable.
I bought Zelda, waited for the game, and tried again.
The production of rotten goods, the sale of rotten goods, the result of bad service, bought six watches to send children, one of the fast numbers showed not complete, the time of six pieces is inconsistent, the difference of more than ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask the manufacturer whether the watch has a check time in the warehouse?They replied that "there is", since there is, then why is there a so many time difference, it is certainly the watch has no accuracy, simply say that it is a seafood product, not what I said is ugly, look, obviously the quality problem (the number is not complete) are taken out to sell, is not garbage.
I contacted the seller, the seller said a lot of reasons, but also complained that the original should not buy their things, such a product, such a seller, such after-sales service, who will dare to buy things on Amazon in the future.
In short, I recommend not to buy things with this seller, but also to buy garbage.
Amazon shipping issues
Upon receipt of the goods, the inspection found that:
1, the table packaging is seriously dilapidated.
2, the table instructions have serious use of folds.
3, the table does not go, the lamp charging is not used, can not adjust the time.
4, contact Amazon customer service, can only be mailed to the United States at their own expense, after the postage fee.
The reason for 5 and 2 minutes is that the customer service is good.
I can only say that it is still together.
Time is not very accurate, about one second a day, it takes only a few months to get fast more than two minutes.
I have used a piece of Cycole before, and I don't feel that it will be a few seconds in a year or two.
The perennial calendar function is quite good, the timing function is a little bit of chicken ribs, basically not used, and occasionally accidentally touches into the time mode.
Solar sports watch
Advantages: Solar charging does not have to worry about replacing the battery, with world time, a variety of alarms and a full reminder.
Inadequate: The mirror is easy to scratch and dust.
Cost-effective: the general domestic price is between 220-300, and the overseas purchase is more than 180 (it takes about 1 week).
A very happy watch.
It is certainly authentic, go to the special inspection, the appearance of the watch is very beautiful, fine workmanship, with foot, plus the imported mechanical movement, so there is a certain amount of weight, those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watch can not be compared, this is the real.
The time of the table is very accurate, the error is completely within the acceptable range, the table packaging has a jewelry identification certificate, the 12 words of the dial are real diamonds, this is very suitable to wear, as a gift to send out also has a face.
The Bentley watch is really good.
The worst shopping ever.
On the evening of September 23, his wife's mobile phone fell, and Amazon immediately ordered an 8p, which was goods but not self-operated and no mark-up (hearts are happy), because it was not self-operated shipments were relatively slow, and the system showed that it was expected to receive goods until September 27 at the latest.
My wife did not have a mobile phone to die, the next day at 6 o'clock in the morning more than ask me to think of a way, and then go to Jingdong to see 256G goods can be delivered on the same day, only immediately order another one.
The new purchase is ready, just want to cancel Amazon's order immediately.
Because the order is in the middle of the night, it is impossible to collect the courier in the early morning, and at 7 o'clock, the customer service request to cancel the order, the customer service reply has been cancelled, please wait for the SMS notification.
Well, I wait patiently, to the phone at noon to see, the order is still in the state is still in the state of not shipping, immediately contact the customer service to ask for the cancellation of the order, customer service reply has been operating OK.
At 3 p.m. on the phone to see the order is still there, can not only contact the customer service again to clearly inform the third call, please cancel the order and notify the seller must not ship!
The customer service contacted the seller on the spot under my request, and told me that the seller was not familiar with the system, and to wait for familiarity with the system before operating to cancel the order.
But clearly tell me that the seller already knows, and please rest assured that it will never be shipped.
When I look at the order on Monday, I have already shipped, and I am speechless.
Since it is not possible to contact the seller directly, you can only call the customer service again.
The back of the processing is simply speechless, basically I said a step, customer service to continue to operate.
Orders are still in the state of rejection and are preparing to send them again!
Will Amazon follow suit?
It doesn’t matter if the seller company receives money anyway and doesn’t follow up.
After the summary, the big pieces will never advance the money, which is too troublesome.
It looks good.
I looked at this camera a long time ago, but because there are some other reasons besides the price, so I did not buy it, this time because of the package, the price can also be bought.
After buying the other is no problem, in the software connection, how can not even, my home is TP router, after the Internet check found that many people have this problem, get more than two hours, a variety of router settings, and finally I use 360 WIFI as a medium to get it, during the call to millet customer service, they have no solution to this problem, directly let me contact Amazon after-sales.
Another point worth noting is that I saw the user's comment on the Internet that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and the storage capacity is smaller and cannot be recognized, and I hope you pay attention to this.
It can be used to feel it, the picture can be accepted, but the sound quality is very poor, the machine has a certain degree of heat, and if it is always opened, it feels that this degree of heat is a little difficult to accept.
To sum up, this product still has a lot of shortcomings, I hope you should be careful when you buy.
The reason why I gave 3 stars is because this was bought with the first love of life, and I have been in a relationship for nearly 3 years, so I left last year and went to this time.
The reason why to give 3 stars, because this is with the first love of life to buy, now do not know how much to use, perhaps throw away it!
I have been in a relationship for nearly 3 years, so I left me last year, and now when I think of her, I want to leave this world with heartache, the first woman in my life, bringing me the shadow and heartache of my life, so far I have not been able to come out.
When buying this mobile phone, think of two feelings at that time, or can be together with each other, but now it is unbearable to look back, life may be like this, some people do not want to meet in a lifetime, some things do not want to know, but what can be done?
How many times when I saw the Samsung mobile phone, I thought of her, the pain followed by filling the whole body, I never had to use more than 2 thousand yuan of mobile phones, but when I bought her, but did not hesitate to be good to a person, but one day when she changed her heart, all the mountain oaths will disappear.
Fine products in domestic brands
Huawei is a boutique in the domestic goods.
Low-key co-owners and enterprises rely on technology and quality to win to win customers, which is very different from the current business culture of increasing visibility through advertising operations!
Companies without power can’t do that and don’t dare to do it!
It was from this that I chose HUAWEI.
It took more than six months to buy, and it feels very good, very good.
The reason why I did not give a full score is because once when I used its offline navigation, there was a lack of positioning phenomenon, and I did not find out the reason in the end, and the other times it was very good.
And its online input has been good for the destination, after the search automatically designed the route, after leaving the wifi departure, its automatic offline navigation function is very practical, do not run traffic, it directly with the satellite dialogue to achieve positioning and navigation, very good!
Sony Dafa is good.
Sony's low-end machine, the design is still full, and the price is cheap, the screen is large enough, the battery life is a first-class stick, and it is very suitable for the elderly to use.
Although the time has passed for a long time, there is still no problem with this machine.
But because my Z2 was decentralized, the phone also completed its mission.
