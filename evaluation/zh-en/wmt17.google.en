28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim&#39;s brother said he couldn&#39;t think of anyone who would want to harm him and said &quot;everything is finally getting better.&quot;
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco coroner&#39;s office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is underway.
Louis Galicia, the victim&#39;s brother, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a line cook in Boston, found his dream job as a line cook at the Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons &amp; Daughters said they were &quot;devastated&quot; by Frank&#39;s death.
&quot;We were a small team who got along like a close-knit family and he will be deeply missed,&quot; the spokesman said.
We express our deepest sympathies and condolences to Frank&#39;s family and friends at this tragic time.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially lived in a guest house, but recently &quot;things started to get better.&quot;
&quot;Frank found an apartment and was dating a girl,&quot; Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he can&#39;t think of anyone who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a kind heart and a big heart.
&quot;Frank would often cook dinner for his family,&quot; Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to quarrel with his family.
He is a person who follows everyone&#39;s opinions.
Louis Galicia said: &quot;Everything in this world can go wrong, but Frank is a tough guy who shines every day.&quot;
Anyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department tip line at 415-575-4444.
Junior doctors strike: Call for new industrial action
Junior doctors&#39; representatives have called on the union to approve fresh industrial action over a new contract dispute.
The British Medical Association&#39;s Junior Doctors Committee will ask all its members to support more industrial action from early September.
The Junior Doctors Council said ministers had not addressed concerns over the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott a contract deal with the British Medical Association.
58% of the members who participated in the vote opposed the contract transaction.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, Junior Doctors Council chair Ellen McCourt said the government had been &quot;consistently silent&quot; on the issues leading to the boycott of the contract.
She said: “In light of this, the Junior Doctors Council executive committee has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has called for a formal re-negotiation to address all concerns.”
Responding to the government&#39;s silence, the Junior Doctors Council executive committee has today formally asked the British Medical Association Council to convene a special meeting to approve a long-term plan to escalate industrial action from early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strike in NHS history.
Dr Johann Malawana, the BMA&#39;s junior doctor leader, resigned after a vote to boycott the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told members of the British Medical Association at a meeting ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students that the deal was a good one and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be mandatory for healthcare workers in England.
Russia and Türkiye: “Out of tune”?
A gesture ends a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday, shaking hands and announcing a formal end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
Yet as Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in the splendid halls of a St. Petersburg palace, I had a strong feeling that this reconciliation was what Ankara wanted most.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
Yet even by Mr. Putin&#39;s typically reserved standards, Mr. Putin smiled faintly and betrayed little enthusiasm.
According to reports, Recep Tayyip Erdogan mentioned &quot;good friend&quot; Putin five times.
I can&#39;t remember exactly.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels and even higher.
The next day, a newspaper here wrote that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
However, I think his enthusiasm suggests something to the contrary.
Yet Mr Putin&#39;s continued coolness suggests he has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
The reaction in Moscow was violent.
Mr Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of plotting against Moscow&#39;s back.
Attacks from so-called friends are even harder to accept.
It is difficult, if not impossible, for both parties to re-establish real trust.
Since November, Russian public opinion has also reversed.
For months, the government-controlled media has waged an alarming, all-out attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be responsible for everything.
The most serious of these are accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan’s family has profited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has categorically denied this claim.
However, news coming out of St. Petersburg suggests it&#39;s time to move on.
After all, the premise of this meeting was that Putin received an apology from Turkish President Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First, Erdogan will need the support of all his friends as he narrowly missed being ousted from power after a failed coup last month.
The constant terrorist attacks have obviously taken a heavy toll on him.
There is also a financial motive.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the ban on charter flights that bring millions of Russian tourists to Turkish shores every year.
This number has plummeted by nearly 90%.
Russian travel agencies and charter companies will surely breathe a sigh of relief as flights resume.
They will have a late season wave of Mediterranean tourism.
State television even predicted this week that fruit and vegetable prices would fall once Turkish agricultural imports reopen.
A report in the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: &quot;The tourists have gone, the tomatoes have returned.&quot;
For Moscow, the visit also has additional political value.
Ankara is angered by the weak response from the Western world to the attempted takeover.
In addition, Ankara has long been unhappy with the slow progress of EU accession talks and the interference of Putin, who is keen to exploit the political chill and weaken Turkey&#39;s relations with the Western world.
The Russian leader is sure to score brownie points with Ankara for embracing the elected authorities after the failed coup.
Mind you, this is a gift to Moscow, which has always harbored a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The meeting at the splendid seaside palace thus forged what one analyst described as an &quot;alliance of misfits&quot; between Russia and Turkey, two countries rejected and mistreated by the West.
However, despite the public settlement, major differences remain.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has been playing the role of peacemaker in Syria in recent days, while Russia and Turkey have supported opposing factions.
Predictably, after nearly three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at the press conference that the topic had not yet been discussed.
The Turkish president avoided questions about their differences, while Putin emphasized them.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to seek common ground while reserving differences on the Syrian issue.
After months of open hostility and the possibility of a major catastrophe brought about by the downing of a Russian warplane by NATO member Turkey, it would certainly be a good thing for the two leaders to resume dialogue again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
The bank will be reduced to a back-office unit, according to its chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was once committed to its global ambitions.
However, it was on the verge of bankruptcy eight years ago and had to accept a bailout. Since then, it has given up that pursuit.
During that time, brand strategists used &#39;RBS&#39; to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds sponsoring international sporting events such as rugby&#39;s Six Nations and Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to bring more national brands to the fore.
RBS will be available to Scottish customers but will not revert to the status quo.
In England and Wales, all references outside the head office and stock exchange will change to NatWest Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and the autonomous regions of Northern Ireland.
There are also other more prominent smaller private banking brands such as Coutts, Adam &amp; Co, Drummond and Holt&#39;s Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: &quot;The RBS brand will ultimately be our investor brand and one of the brands our employees are employed by because we are now more of a bank with many brands.&quot;
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS also became a global brand.
At the moment, I would say that we are no longer focused on the global, we have turned our sights locally.
Each brand represents something different in its respective industry, and our employees serve customers through the different brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland has stated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championship; at the same time, it has made efforts to improve the image of different brands in sports event sponsorship.
&quot;The time has come to become a multi-brand bank because privately we have been looking at how we can become a better bank for our customers,&quot; the CEO said.
Three years ago we would have been ridiculed if we had aspired to be a big bank with many brands.
We are currently focused on customer needs, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed the changes.
I think we can relaunch these brands and now is the right time.
Dettori reaches 3,000 career wins with Predilection success at Newmarket
Two wins at Newmarket take Dettori to 3,000 career wins and he celebrates by spraying champagne
Professional jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Friday.
He galloped down the track on Predilection, a horse owned by trainer John Gosden, and scored two wins that night, thus achieving his 3,000th career win.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional jockey to achieve this milestone in flat racing.
The top five are: Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
&quot;It&#39;s special,&quot; said three-time champion jockey Dettori, who had earlier won at Ghayyar.
I was so excited because my family was there too
I&#39;m delighted with what I&#39;ve achieved in Newmarket because that&#39;s where I started 30 years ago.
It&#39;s not a huge horse racing meeting, it&#39;s not Royal Ascot, it&#39;s just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I&#39;m very pleased and humbled.
Dettori brought Predilection after his victory, which caused cheers from the audience.
In the field of jumping, two jockeys have achieved this achievement. They are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy. Sir Cowie had more than 4,300 wins during his record-breaking career.
Berger is a nine-time Derby winner with 4,493 victories in his career.
Dettori is one of the best jockeys of the modern era, so it&#39;s no surprise that he achieved this landmark achievement, which not many had achieved before him.
He&#39;s stylish and muscular, but it&#39;s his tactical nous that really sets him apart in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic equestrian ambassador and his passion and charisma have attracted legions of fans to the sport over the years.
I told Dettori at Epsom a few weeks ago that if he had been more than just a weekend jockey, he would have racked up 6,000 wins!
Seriously, Dettori is Britain&#39;s best showjumping winner in thirty years, and that&#39;s so important.
He has a lively personality, which is a good thing for British racing, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Dettori celebrated the milestone with his signature leaping dismount
From crossing the line to dismounting, Dettori has been a defining figure in British flat racing for two decades.
His career has been a rollercoaster.
He won a number of major races, including his famous &quot;seven wins in a row&quot; at Royal Ascot in 1996, but he also suffered a plane crash and was suspended for doping.
When he returned to action three years ago after a six-month ban, he struggled. However, he showed amazing character strengths and finally returned to the top, giving those who were skeptical a slap in the face.
He may not be able to do it for much longer - Dettori has said before that he hopes to compete at least until he is 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin sacks Sergei Ivanov as chief of staff
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov from his post as chief of staff.
For years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of a core group of people who enjoy Mr. Putin&#39;s trust.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed special representative for environment and transportation issues.
A Kremlin statement said Mr. Putin had &quot;announced the dismissal of Ivanov as chief of staff of the Russian president,&quot; but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, Mr Ivanov&#39;s deputy since 2012, has been named as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, in 1972. He graduated from the famous Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government staff, the Kremlin website said (in Russian).
After being appointed, he told Mr Putin: &quot;Thank you for your confidence.&quot;
I believe that the most important task of this government is to support the Head of State in drafting laws and controlling the implementation of directives.
Mr Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr Ivanov himself had asked to resign and had recommended Mr Vaino to succeed him.
Is this smile convincing?
Moscow was puzzled by the move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin&#39;s closest aides and, like Putin, also worked in the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As chief of staff, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, both men said the chief of staff had asked for his resignation.
Despite all the smiles for the cameras, few were convinced - especially this time before parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of losing some kind of power struggle?
No way of knowing yet.
But the official story - that a man once considered a presidential candidate was suddenly chosen to run Russia&#39;s environmental policy - has drawn much skepticism.
&quot;Yes, in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to give me this difficult, even troublesome, position,&quot; Mr Ivanov said, quoted on the Kremlin website in a conversation with Mr Putin. , a four-year term.&quot;
&quot;As it turns out, I&#39;ve been chief of staff to the president for four years and eight months.&quot;
Mr. Ivanov assumed this position in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a member of Russia&#39;s Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the National Security Service.
When Mr Putin became head of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Service) in the late 1990s, Mr Ivanov was named his deputy.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov one of his five most trusted people.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become Russia&#39;s president at the end of Mr Putin&#39;s second term, as three consecutive terms would be unconstitutional.
But the position ultimately went to Dmitry Medvedev, another close aide to Putin.
Mr Putin served as Russia&#39;s prime minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later.
Mysterious fish appears in Banff garden
A Banff resident called for help after spotting a fish in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes the 75 fish may be sand eels blown by offshore tornadoes.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the strange scene on Periscope in the hope someone could explain the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Bridge now leads to Fife
The £1.35bn project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct, meaning the bridge now reaches Fife.
Four &quot;deck fan&quot; closures located near each of the bridge&#39;s three bridgeheads are now nearing completion, and this project is the first of its kind on a bridge.
The section of the bridge starting in Fife is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It used 10,000 tonnes of steel, 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay cables.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first people to climb onto the bridge.
&quot;This is a historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge,&quot; he said.
We have all witnessed the engineering work that goes into a project of this magnitude, with more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used to build just this section of the bridge.
Despite the bridge&#39;s size and weight, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck required delicate work and extremely precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck has now been installed, with the final section of concrete deck being poured in Rosyth today, meaning that all bridge decks are ready to be put into place.
Michael Martin, project director at Queensferry Bridge Construction Company, said: &quot;No matter which bridge project it is, the first closure is a major milestone.&quot;
This collaboration demonstrates cutting-edge civil engineering technology for this remarkable project.
After installing the final section of pavement and connecting it to the enlarged Northbridge pavement, the next step was to close the remaining gap on the north or landward side.
Completing this operation requires moving the northern viaduct approach southward by 700 mm.
This is a huge operation, but also a very precise one.
It is said to be huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes, and needs to be pulled out at a slope of about 3%.
It&#39;s precise because the engineering team needed to ensure that the deviation was very small, just a few millimeters on each side.
Happily, everything went smoothly.
Simone Biles wins women&#39;s all-around gymnastics title
Forget about stress.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is unfazed by all this.
Full of energy on vault.
Easily on the balance beam.
Amazing floor exercise moves.
The overall performance was brilliant.
Now, I finally became an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the all-around title on Thursday, fully demonstrating her world-leading talent in gymnastics at the Olympics.
Her total score of 62.198 far surpassed silver medalist and &quot;Final Five&quot; member Aly Raisman and bronze medalist Russia&#39;s Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States performs on the balance beam during the women&#39;s individual all-around rhythmic gymnastics final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles helped the United States achieve four consecutive Olympic all-around titles in women&#39;s gymnastics. She won a total of five medals at the Olympics, further confirming that she is the best of this generation, and possibly ever. Gymnasts.
When he saw his total score, Biles couldn&#39;t help but shed tears. She finally ended her long journey.
Biles joins the ranks of once-in-a-decade athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their respective sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated the competition for the past three years, winning a total of 15 world championship medals, including ten gold medals. With ambition, she trains hard every day to achieve higher precision. Mary Lou Retton, the 1984 Olympic champion, said: &quot;Biles is the best gymnast I have ever seen.&quot;
There&#39;s one final meet in Brazil, but this one will be less about Biles competing against other gymnasts than about herself versus the overwhelming pressure of expectations.
It would be a huge disappointment if Biles didn&#39;t return home to Spring, Texas, loaded with gold medals.
Simone Biles (left) and Raisman of the United States hug each other after winning the gold and silver medals respectively in the women&#39;s individual all-around rhythmic gymnastics finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles won her first gold medal on Tuesday, giving retiring national team coach Martha Karolyi a surprise gift at her farewell party.
While Biles insists she didn&#39;t plan for the future during her perennial reign as champion, that&#39;s not entirely true.
A section of Biles&#39; floor exercise, including one of her signature somersaults, is set to Latin music that she listens to in her home just across the street from the Rio Olympics venue. of.
This is no coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandparents as an infant and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman&#39;s mother during a field trip to the gym has grown into a mainstay.
Since the summer of 2013, Biles has not failed in the all-around competition. As long as she wants to win, she will win.
Mustafina&#39;s slight lead after two spins was an illusion.
Biles, the defending world champion in the balance beam and floor exercise, was waiting in ambush.
She scored 15.433 on the balance beam and 15.933 on the floor exercise.
While waiting for the final score to come out, Raisman gave Biles a gentle hug. When Biles learned that he had achieved the result he had dreamed of, he burst into tears.
Raisman&#39;s performance felt a bit like revenge for four years ago, when she tied for third but lost to Mustafina in a tiebreaker.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, nicknamed &quot;Grandma&quot; by Americans, was far ahead.
She blew a kiss to the crowd after the floor exercise, announcing a return that had sometimes looked questionable before.
Biles is only 19 years old. News of it has been going viral on Twitter since earlier this week. As far as Biles is concerned, his life has taken on a whole new meaning.
Mahaj Brown, 6, who was &quot;shot multiple times&quot; survives Philadelphia shooting
A six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, police said, becoming the second six-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The child&#39;s grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to areas including his groin, legs, arms and abdomen, but the child was conscious on the way to the hospital.
&quot;He suffered a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets,&quot; his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the TV station.
I can not believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in hospital and has undergone multiple surgeries.
His family told the station the child was expected to recover.
He was due to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Among the other three people shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition.
The child and the 29-year-old victim, who was in critical condition, were found in the front seat of the car, the TV station said.
The other two victims were not in the vehicle, and police are investigating whether the shooter was among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia it looked like there was an exchange of gunfire between multiple gunmen.
Many shell casings of assault weapons were found at the scene, from which it can be inferred that they used different assault weapons.
Judging from this, this is undoubtedly a continuous war.
There were shell casings on the sidewalks on both sides of the street.
&quot;So, it appears that there were multiple armed men at the scene who were engaged in a fierce battle,&quot; Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
Many houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
No arrests have been made yet. It is said that the police are reviewing surveillance video.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old girl was shot in the arm by a stray bullet while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane community.
She is currently recovering and police are still searching for the suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie
That’s how I rate this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team, for more reasons than one.
First, I&#39;ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
Secondly, this gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts - Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, They have been an inspiration to so many girls of color.
Everyone is proud of the team&#39;s composition, which includes Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian.
This team finally looks like Team USA.
It also cemented Black and Latinx women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the top female gymnasts have been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle came in first and second respectively.
This is amazing.
At the last Olympics, Gabrielle Douglas &quot;unexpectedly&quot; became the Olympic champion, which made the United States cheer.
Today, the world can witness the incredible performances of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez. They performed conventional gymnastics skills to perfection.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. win its fourth straight title in the women&#39;s individual all-around event.
Her teammate Aly Raisman took home the silver medal.
We reach the top of our sport, but not in gymnastics classrooms across the United States.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie have the same path to the Olympic team as Ali and Madison.
They are the &quot;Final Five&quot; as the next Olympic gymnastics team will consist of four gymnasts, Marta Karolyi&#39;s final year as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs. Their parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel expenses (including coaches and gymnasts and their families). related costs), and the list of costs continues to grow.
Most gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that support the industry.
All of the gymnasts&#39; training is done at these clubs, which is a long-term expensive expense for the gymnasts&#39; families.
Biles&#39; coach, Aimee Boorman, and Hernandez&#39;s coach, Maggie Haney, have coached the two gymnasts since they began practicing gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the countless young girls impacted by Simone, Gabrielle, and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organization, we provide free, low-cost gymnastics in residential neighborhoods to more than 15,000 urban youth, primarily black and Hispanic, and produce national and world champions.
In September we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.
Gymnastics helps develop physical strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as hard work, self-discipline and determination.
These can provide lifelong benefits to a person&#39;s health, academic and work success.
Thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics inspired by this team, which is really cool.
Playing sports means a lot, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you to Simone, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their wonderful display of “girl power” in winning Olympic team gold medals, and for inspiring so many young girls from all backgrounds to start a journey towards health, wellness and health. The path to strength and success.
Junior doctors plan further strikes after Jeremy Hunt proposal rejected
Ministers had initially hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a revised contract from British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58% of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the vote opposed the contract.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose contracts, saying the NHS was currently in a &quot;vacuum&quot; and any delay would harm the interests of staff and patients.
The new contract begins with changes to junior doctors&#39; overnight and weekend working practices to improve out-of-hours care.
Last night, Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA&#39;s junior doctors committee, said in a statement: &quot;Junior doctors continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly concerns that it will exacerbate the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly.&quot;
With just eight weeks left until the first doctors sign new contracts, we need to make progress and time is running out.
The BMA has tried to negotiate a resolution to the dispute, but there has been a reluctance to engage, and sometimes the government has responded with silence.
Still, just last month we got a commitment from Jeremy Hunt, who said his door is always open.
&quot;Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the mandate and address the concerns of junior doctors&quot;.
If he fails to do so, junior doctors have made it clear they are ready to take further industrial action.
The last strike, in late April, resulted in the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants covered doctors on the picket lines.
Ministers initially hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the BMA&#39;s revised contract.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors covered by the contract.
NHS Employers chief executive Daniel Mortimer has called on junior doctors not to stage any further strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: “Industrial action will achieve little but put pressure on already stretched teams and services, causing worry, anxiety and disruption for patients, carers and their families.”
Over the past two months we have been in ongoing negotiations with the Junior Doctors Committee and working with the Department of Health and other departments to proactively respond to their concerns about the guardian role and whistleblowing.
Employers want to continue to actively discuss other important topics - such as deployment, training flexibility, alternative training for those returning to work after a career break, training costs, common understanding of the syllabus, further study leave and the medical field The gender pay gap shows how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health take the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
£2-a-day drug could reduce heart attack threat
Thousands of heart patients could benefit from a £2-a-day drug after officials suggest it be given to more patients and taken for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor may reduce the risk of another heart attack in people with heart disease.
This drug, when taken for 12 months after a heart attack, reduces the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the regulator for the NHS, recommends that patients continue taking the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now NHS regulator NICE is recommending that patients continue taking the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Around 140,000 people in England suffer from a heart attack each year, and a quarter of these will go on to suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by plaque deposits of fatty material in the walls of arteries.
If the plaque breaks off, it can cause blood clots, which can block blood flow to the heart and lead to a heart attack.
If the clot moves, it can enter the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already experienced a heart attack are at higher risk of having another heart attack.
Ticagrelor, made by British company AstraZeneca and marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk by reducing the formation of blood clots.
NICE draft guidance published today recommends that patients take 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of ticagrelor and aspirin twice a day for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE&#39;s Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: &quot;Despite effective secondary prevention treatments, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will have another heart attack or stroke, often with serious consequences.&quot;
The fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person&#39;s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor, taken together with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of another heart attack and stroke in people who have had a heart attack.
We are pleased that the interim recommendation for ticagrelor will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who could benefit.
Because there is limited information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor beyond three years, particularly the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend continuation of treatment with ticagrelor beyond this period.
Computer culture makes &quot;election fraud&quot; prevalent in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was sacked last year for corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
A culture of &quot;political correctness&quot; has allowed widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities to be turned a blind eye, a damaging government report revealed today.
Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles accused police, the electoral watchdog and councils of turning a blind eye to evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot;hypersensitivity to racial profiling and religion&quot;.
The former community affairs minister and current anti-corruption leader said that intimidating voters with religious stances has a bad impact and that the police should be allowed to set up cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He advised voters to bring identification documents to prove their identity when voting.
Currently, voters only need to state their name and address.
The report even suggested coating voters&#39; fingers with indelible ink to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said there should be greater protection for whistleblowers.
He called for increased media access to meeting documents and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
“This is not just about guarding against electoral fraud, but also about protecting local governments from a broader culture of corruption and the financial fraud that is closely tied to it,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street following the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election tribunal ruled that the current mayor, Rahman, had committed a series of corruption and illegal acts and should be removed from office.
The tribunal found that Rahman &quot;grossly abused&quot; the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and remained silent about accusations that he was racist and Islamophobic.
Rahman is said to have &quot;declared during the campaign that it was a religious duty for loyal Muslims to vote for him.&quot;
As many as 300 ballots are suspect, and voters may have voted by pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
He specifically warned of fraud in postal elections, in which senior members of the Muslim community allegedly pressured voters to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (pictured) gave a number of suggestions for cleaning up the voting system, including bringing ID to prove who you are
He said in the report: &quot;Evidence suggests that senior members, particularly from communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background, exert pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to follow their own Will vote.”
&quot;They fear state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behavior due to oversensitivity to racial profiling and religious &#39;political correctness&#39;.&quot;
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including a strict ban on political campaigners handling postal voting documents to stop &quot;vote harvesting&quot;.
The report also calls for tighter checks on registration information to prevent electoral rolls being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
The recommendations include requiring voters to show identification before voting.
Indelible ink is applied to voters&#39; fingers after voting to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Systematically verify voters&#39; ethnic affiliation to ensure eligibility to vote.
Sets expiration date for automatic mail-in ballot requests to three years.
Political activists and activists are prohibited from handling completed postal votes and postal voting envelopes.
Authorizes police to set up cordons around polling stations.
Changes to the law will make it easier to charge individuals with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Makes it illegal to take photos at polling stations.
Requires that only English may be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly implement the rule that &quot;voters go to the polling hall alone&quot;.
Sir Eric has lambasted the Metropolitan Police, saying it was &quot;astonishing&quot; they had not laid any criminal charges following the Tower Hamlets incident.
“Rahman and his election officers committed many corrupt and illegal acts, and were therefore disqualified by the election court,” he said.
Under criminal standards of proof, he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in many respects.
He also criticized the ineffective “tick-box checks” of City Hall’s electoral registration department.
Sir Eric said: &quot;Last year&#39;s court decision in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.&quot;
Our country has a glorious tradition as the &quot;Mother of Parliaments&quot;. However, the secretive electoral fraud committed by certain institutions and their subsequent denials are really worrying and threaten this good reputation.

“I don’t think I look alike other than the beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
&quot;He&#39;s a good-looking playboy, so I guess that&#39;s a compliment.&quot;
One of the most popular comparisons from the London 2012 Olympics will no doubt draw more similarities this year: British long jumper Greg Rutherford looks a lot like actor Neil Patrick Harris Patrick Harris).

CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for comment that Chinese swimmers were &#39;slow as pigs&#39;
Byron MacDonald angered viewers of CBC&#39;s live Olympic coverage on Wednesday with his comments about 14-year-old Ai Yanhan&#39;s fourth-place finish in the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after a commentator said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer &quot;swam faster than the stench at the start&quot; during a race but ended &quot;as slow as a pig.&quot;
Commentator Byron Macdonald thought his microphone had been turned off when he expressed some thoughts at the end of the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay final.
The audience heard Byron, who was commentating on the contestants with &quot;colored glasses&quot; on the CBC commentator team, saying: &quot;That 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake.&quot;
I was so excited that I started swimming faster than the stench could spread, but then I started swimming as slowly as a pig.
It&#39;s all thanks to her.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds behind Canada&#39;s Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadian team to narrow the gap with China.
Audiences across Canada were shocked by the commentator&#39;s tone and wording, and they quickly reacted online.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: &quot;That CBC commentator said China&#39;s 14-year-old swimmer was &#39;as slow as a pig&#39;???&quot;
This idiot didn&#39;t realize it was live.
Chinese teenager Ai Yanhan, who participated in the finals of the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay, was described as follows: &quot;The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake.&quot;
Criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly came flooding in on Twitter, with many calling for him to step down from commentary.
Twitter users didn&#39;t stop there when they heard about Byron McDonald&#39;s lackluster response.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow #ByronMcDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and your words and actions make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #reallyannoying.
Shortly after, CBC Radio host Scott Russel apologized on-air for Byron&#39;s comments, saying: &quot;We apologize for comments we made on-air about a swimmer&#39;s performance.&quot;
&quot;We apologize for this inappropriate choice of words.&quot;
CBC apologized more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the comments
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also apologized on behalf of Byron.
The CBC later copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who protested Byron&#39;s commentary.
The channel was quick to apologize and release a statement.
We are incredibly sorry for saying this and broadcasting it live.
Last night, we moved quickly to apologize to those who tuned in to our live broadcast and those who follow us on social media.
It should be noted that Byron&#39;s commentary was aimed at the swimmer&#39;s performance, but not at her personally.
That said, the wording was certainly inappropriate and Byron is deeply sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, Macdonald apologized on air, saying his words were not intended as a personal attack and trying to excuse them.
&quot;I want to take a moment to apologize for the comments I made last night after the women&#39;s relay race,&quot; he said on the CBC Olympics broadcast.
&quot;I&#39;m just commenting on the swimmer&#39;s performance, not personally.&quot;
&quot;Of course, I didn&#39;t mean any disrespect and I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
Primark customers express anger at woman who shamelessly tried on knickers in the middle of the store
A woman took off her clothes and tried on underwear in the middle of a Primark store, leaving customers confused as to where to look.
To make matters worse, she looked at how she looked in them, then took them off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued browsing the shelves and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The woman tried on underwear before putting them back on the shelves at the Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone
Mother-of-two Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after trying on the lingerie, the mystery woman &quot;got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.&quot;
&quot;Everyone couldn&#39;t believe what they were seeing,&quot; she said.
She stood in the middle of the store, took a pair of panties off the shelf, took off her leggings and panties, and then put them on.
&quot;She didn&#39;t try to find a secluded place to try it on - she just stood there and was so shameless.&quot;
&quot;Everyone was stunned when she took her knickers off again. She was obviously still not satisfied because she put the knickers back on the shelf.&quot;
After that, she tried three more like this, and finally found that she didn&#39;t like any of them, so she got dressed again and walked out of the store.
&quot;She didn&#39;t seem to care that anyone was looking at her - or thought about who might end up buying the panties she was trying on.&quot;
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: &quot;It&#39;s disgusting to think that someone would buy someone else&#39;s unwashed underwear.&quot;
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: &quot;The staff apparently had to take the knickers off the shelves after she left, which was fortunate.&quot;
&quot;I hate getting home a new pair of underwear only to find that another woman has tried them on and they haven&#39;t been washed.&quot;
A Primark spokesman said: &quot;Primark is aware of what happened at our Folkestone store on Tuesday 9 August.&quot;
All products in question have been removed from the shelves.
How to use Krav Maga to protect yourself during a gun attack
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com might give you a little sense of security.
We asked New York-based Krav Maga Federation master Rhon Mizrachi for tips on how to deal with an armed assailant up close.
Whether he approaches you from the front or from behind, this video will teach you how to turn defeat into victory.
If a gunman approaches you from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so you can see the attacker and &quot;clear the line of fire,&quot; Mizrachi said.
Next, hold the gun between your forearm and shoulder and strike the attacker in the face with your elbow.
Next, knee him in the groin, and when the attacker doubles over in pain, twist the gun in his hand and hit him in the face with the barrel and backup group, keeping the weapon pointed at him.
Use a similar technique if a gunman approaches from the front - keep your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist the muzzle so the gunman cannot fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and strike the attacker in the chest, twist the muzzle of the gun from his grasp, and point the muzzle at him.
Sound complicated?
Check out the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, if you&#39;re not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to get out of a robbery is to hand over your cash.
A gangster family destroy their council house in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A hooligan family who were evicted for terrorizing their neighbors vandalized their tenement before leaving, causing £50,000 of damage.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their rented house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly evicted from the property, housing association officials were shocked to find extensive damage to the property.
There were holes all over the walls, the floor was torn, trash was thrown all over the floor, and the walls were painted messily.
The family have been on the move since being evicted and are now said to be living in a private home
Cornwall Housing Association housing manager Donna McEvoy said she feared the property was beyond saving.
&quot;It&#39;s a nightmare for the people who live here and I don&#39;t think people can live like this,&quot; she said.
There is now a lot to weigh up as the property is likely to become a less than stellar element of Cornwall.
The family was notorious, and so were their names.
The couple has three sons who live here from time to time. Police said the family&#39;s horrific behavior included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing, yelling, arguing and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant, named Skeldon, was handed an anti-social behavior decision.
Many rooms in this house, which may be demolished, are filled with long-standing rubbish
In this room where drugs were once traded, the floorboards were lifted
Neighbors said they often saw them fighting in the street and often called the police because of this.
Cornwall Housing Association forcibly evicted her and her husband from the property this week after giving them an 11-week extension to move out voluntarily.
Neighbors cheered the news of relief, saying their lives had been a living hell.
&quot;They don&#39;t care about anybody,&quot; one neighbor said.
We&#39;ve lived next door to them for 20 years and it&#39;s always been this bad.
We have seen the police come to our door numerous times.
&quot;We couldn&#39;t sleep this morning.&quot;
We woke up early because it was so quiet here - we weren&#39;t used to it yet!
It was great that they were finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive community manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years and police regularly visit
Trash and old toys were dumped on the overgrown side of the housing complex
He added: “It is regrettable that the tenant has not been held accountable for her actions with her family and eviction is the last option considered by Cornwall Housing.”
This was a very difficult case to deal with because their behavior was so extreme and what they did must have terrified the neighbors.
I would like to thank my team for their work, Devon and Cornwall Police and the members of the community who have bravely come forward with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to neighbours, and send a message that we have no tolerance for anti-social behaviour.
Mr Fitzpatrick said their three sons had lived in the house at different times, but said they were all in their 20s.
After they were evicted, a dirty mattress was left on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
Housing association workers will soon clear piles of rubbish around houses
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales, drug paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of class B drugs with intent to sell drugs.
She claimed the money was used to buy a tombstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood Tanya now lives with her husband in a private house in Plymouth after becoming homeless.
The walls of several rooms in the house were covered in graffiti.
Police say they will evict tenants who violate tenant rules.
Angela Crow, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout tenant rules.
&quot;This warning is directed at those who feel they are immune to blame for their actions and those who are devastated by this behaviour,&quot; she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police have no tolerance for crime and anti-social behavior and they will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillary will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he is confident that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland&#39;s confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president will choose this person to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland, who &quot;has some credibility.&quot;
A Reade spokeswoman later said Reade had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether Garland would be nominated and said he was merely speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton&#39;s team didn&#39;t want to &quot;rock the boat&quot; with a new pick.
Garland is chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland&#39;s nomination are &quot;favorites&quot; and &quot;achievers&quot; of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit to be president.
&quot;Treats&quot;: Nude calendar &quot;loved by both men and women&quot;
Treats magazine will team up with photographer David Bellemere to shoot a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, instead of famous nudes, they plan to look for a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboy because &quot;that magazine is geared toward men.&quot;
And we cater to women.
Apparently, he thought this calendar set was the same.
“We need to showcase timeless and classic nudes that both women and men feel comfortable in, and this was inspired by that,” Shaw said at a launch event for the calendar.
Women will love being a part of this shoot because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can apply online by submitting photos or in person at open recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Video report shows: Small-headed sleeper shark is the longest-lived vertebrate
Scientists say the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on Earth.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying sharks, said that according to records, there is a female small-headed sleeper shark estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old, with a body length of five meters.
French court rejects petition to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a petition by the Calais government to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the &quot;Jungle&quot; refugee camp. Thousands of refugees currently live in the camp.
At a court hearing this week, the Calais government argued that the French government should have the right to demolish a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp. Shops in the camps sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, provide haircuts and sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or a few euros in makeshift restaurants. Basic meals.
The office of the governor of Calais believes these places should be demolished because they are parallel economies that do not pay taxes and present fire and sanitary hazards.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were vital because free food provided by state-backed associations and other groups simply could not meet the needs of the camp&#39;s growing refugee population.
They say these makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Lille ruled there was no legal basis to evict the operators of the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais governor&#39;s concerns were &quot;completely understandable&quot;.
Judge Jean-François Molla said the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants went far beyond simply providing food to refugees &quot;living in extremely dangerous conditions&quot;.
He said these places serve as calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition is the camp’s Jungle Book Kids café, a non-profit shop that provides 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and supports hundreds of unaccompanied people in the camp. Provide asylum advice to vulnerable minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to save the cafe.
A letter to the Guardian said closing the cafe &quot;would be a catastrophe for these children, many as young as eight.&quot;
Charities Help Refugees and L&#39;Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camp had topped 9,000, the highest level since a surge in arrivals during the summer.
&quot;This 5,000 yuan subsidy has solved my urgent need.&quot;
Zhou Fen, a girl from a registered poor household in Mipo Village, Changle Township, Huayuan County, received the admission notice from the University of Nanhua.
Just when she was worried about the enrollment fee, on August 9, the Youth League County Committee promptly provided her with a 5,000 yuan subsidy.
In the past few days, relevant county departments have also provided 2.838 million yuan in education subsidies for more than 690 poor college students.
At the same time, for those whose family financial situation is particularly difficult, we also organize social donations to help them complete their studies.
Huayuan has integrated more than 18.5 million yuan in student aid funds this year, and raised more than 2.5 million yuan from the finance department. The financial department will pay the real-name bank cards of poor students within the prescribed time limit.
She said gratefully: &quot;I thought my father had passed away and my brother and I would not be able to go to college. Unexpectedly, the county solved our difficulties in time.&quot;
As of August 8, Huayuan has provided more than 21 million yuan in various relief funds for 13,140 poor students in the first half of this year.
All poor students in the county are provided with assistance as much as they need and any assistance they need.
The reporter saw at the scene that the front of a large container truck moved to the express lane under the command of the traffic police. The container fell onto the greenway and a 2 cm deep hole was created on the roadside.
According to Xinhua News Agency, the Australian government of New South Wales announced on the 11th that it will spend 200 million Australian dollars (approximately 154 million U.S. dollars) to carry out the largest-scale renovation of the famous Sydney Opera House since its completion.
The New South Wales government said the renovations would not change the opera house&#39;s shell-like appearance.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney&#39;s landmark buildings. It was designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon and built in 1973. It receives about 8 million visitors every year.
Rory Jeffs, general manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera House will use this renovation to make a &quot;turnaround&quot; and become &quot;one of the concert halls with the best acoustics in the world.&quot;
Non-Beijing citizens who have lived in Beijing for more than 6 months and meet one of the conditions of legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence, and continuous study in Beijing can apply for a residence permit.
Recently, the implementation details of Beijing&#39;s &quot;Interim Regulations on Residence Permit&quot; were released, which means that the &quot;Temporary Residence Permit&quot; will be upgraded to a &quot;Residence Permit&quot;.
The person in charge of the relevant department said that the change from &quot;temporary residence permit&quot; to &quot;residence permit&quot; means that Beijing will shift from &quot;management&quot; to multi-faceted services for the non-resident population.
The reporter learned today from the State Administration of Taxation that as of the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels had announced 2,470 &quot;blacklist&quot; cases of tax violations.
It is understood that in July 2014, the State Administration of Taxation took the lead among functional departments of the central government and jointly issued the &quot;Measures for Information Disclosure of Major Tax Violation Cases&quot; in conjunction with the &quot;Tax Credit Management Measures&quot;.
Not only will the illegal facts, legal basis, handling and punishment of these cases be announced, but the basic information of the illegal parties and the responsible persons of relevant intermediary agencies will also be included in the &quot;blacklist&quot; and exposed.
Government departments such as quality inspection, finance, and customs have also taken relevant disciplinary measures against those involved in the &quot;blacklist&quot;.
&quot;The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the construction of the entire social credit system. It marks the continuous development and improvement of my country&#39;s social credit system and its increasing maturity.&quot;
&quot;Environmental problems are manifested in air, water, and soil pollution, but their roots are still in production and lifestyle.&quot;
For example, in 2015, the land development rate in Jiangsu Province was as high as 21%, ranking the highest among provinces and autonomous regions in the country.
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, large amounts of energy, and large land occupation have not yet been fundamentally addressed through the transformation of production and lifestyle.
On the one hand, Jiangsu Province ranks first in the country with absolute advantages in terms of the effectiveness of ecological environment creation at all levels and in all types; but on the other hand, the resources and environment are under great pressure.
To solidly promote ecological environment protection and governance, we need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle, and promote transformation to benefit people&#39;s livelihood through the construction of ecological civilization.
On the 11th, at the Lianyungang Port Terminal, 42 wind turbine blades produced by Guodian Group were loaded for export to South Africa.
Since last year, Guodian Group has exported a total of 163 wind power projects to South Africa from Lianyungang Port.
The third-party company (non-Chinese company) commissioned by the Olympic Organizing Committee to produce the national flag is in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, about 75 kilometers away from Sao Paulo City.
In order to urge the manufacturer to complete the work as soon as possible, the Chinese Consulate General in Sao Paulo organized special personnel to rush to the factory to do in-depth work.
After 30 hours of overtime work, the manufacturer finally completed the production of the Chinese flag and loaded it for shipment, completing the task that originally took 4-5 working days ahead of schedule.
It is reported that the flag is expected to arrive in Rio on the 11th. After receiving the flag, the Olympic Organizing Committee will send it to various Olympic venues. The entire process will be completed under the supervision of the Chinese Embassy and Consulate in Brazil.
According to this newspaper, on the 10th, the Nantong Municipal Government held a discussion event on Hutong industrial cooperation at the Shanghai International Convention Center. More than 180 Shanghai companies were invited to participate, and 2 billion Hutong industry docking projects worth more than 2 billion yuan were signed on site.
The 20 projects signed collectively have a total investment of 8.063 billion yuan, involving multiple industries such as new energy, new materials, and modern service industries.
Qingdao is the 12th pilot city in the country and the first pilot city in Shandong Province for the paid use and trading of emission rights.
On the 11th, a number of companies came to the Qingdao Emissions Rights Trading Center to submit applications for emission rights. After the application is accepted, paid usage fees will be paid.
The first transaction that is about to be completed this time also heralds the official start of Qingdao’s emissions trading pilot work. It will also be the first emissions trading transaction in the province and the first city-level emissions trading transaction in the country.
On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd., came to the Qingdao Emission Rights Trading Center to submit an application for emission rights.
The company&#39;s factory in the old town of Qingdao ceased production at the end of last year and moved to a new factory in Pingdu for environmental protection.
After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, construction project environmental impact report and other materials, the Qingdao Emission Rights Reserve and Trading Service Center began a preliminary review of the application materials.
According to the collection standards determined by the price and finance departments of Qingdao City, the current estimated initial emission rights usage fee is approximately 641,200 yuan, and the staff will complete the verification within 7 working days.
The first transaction that is about to be completed this time also heralds the official start of Qingdao’s emissions trading pilot work. It will also be the first emissions trading transaction in the province and the first city-level emissions trading transaction in the country.
Zhao Xiuping said that at present, enterprises have invested 400 million yuan in environmental protection, which is a huge amount on the surface, but it has a great impact on enterprise management concepts and social benefits, and it also opens up space for enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Bus Parts Co., Ltd. also came to apply for emission rights for a project with an annual output of 4,200 high-speed rail and EMU interior parts.
This project belongs to a mechanical processing enterprise, and the initial emission rights applied for are chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons/year and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons/year.
The paid use and trading of air pollutant emission rights are key industrial enterprises in the city&#39;s electricity and heat production and supply.
Existing pollutant discharge units that have obtained environmental impact assessments before January 1, 2016 will not be levied paid usage fees for the time being.
&quot;Obtaining paid emission rights does not mean obtaining the right to illegally discharge pollutants, and one cannot discharge pollutants at will.&quot;
Han Hongyan, deputy director of the Qingdao Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if illegal pollution or excessive pollution still have to be punished in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid punishment by purchasing emission rights.
In other words, we must use legal means to severely crack down on environmental violations and severely punish enterprises for exceeding the standard of pollutant discharge, so as to protect the environment and protect public health.
Now, for their own benefit, enterprises have increased their enthusiasm for pollution control, cherished their limited emission rights, and reduced pollutant emissions.
Driven by economic interests, the reduction of pollutant emissions has changed from a mandatory behavior by the government to a conscious market behavior by enterprises, thereby truly achieving the goals of protecting the environment, protecting nature, and protecting public health.
Emission rights, also known as &quot;emission rights&quot;, are the rights to discharge pollutants. They refer to the rights that emitters have according to law to discharge pollutants into the environment within the quota allocated by the government.
This right is essentially the right of the polluter to possess, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.
In the next step, under the premise that the total amount of pollutant emissions does not exceed the allowable emission amount, the internal pollution sources will adjust the amount of pollutant emissions to each other through currency exchange.
Emissions trading was proposed by the American economist Dales in 1968 and has been applied to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources in the United States since the 1970s.
Our country started piloting it in 2007, and currently 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu are fully implementing it.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, in order to assist these six strategic bombers in carrying out air strikes against &quot;Islamic State&quot; targets in Syria, multiple Russian fighter jets took off from the Khmeimim Air Base in Syria to provide support.
On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire for all parties to the Syrian conflict. The ceasefire agreement began to be implemented on the 27th of that month.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations designated by the United Nations Security Council such as the Islamic State and the Jabhat al-Nusra Front.
Russia will continue to build relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian soldiers will also be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if extremist forces are not combated, these forces will expand into Russia.
Although Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on jointly combating extremist forces in Syria, Russia will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran, Iraq and other parties in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia began military strikes against extremist forces in Syria at the invitation of the Syrian government.
On March 15 this year, Russia&#39;s main military forces in Syria began to withdraw, but Russia promised to continue to retain the Hmeimim air base and the naval base in Tartus.
In the cases of rebirth of old houses and successful rural creation, He Peijun has set a good example: inheriting a century-old house while also telling the inheritance story of a piece of land.
Today, an average of 100,000 people gather in Zhushan every year, either to bring a variety of creativity or to seek inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the countryside and the city should be about accompanying each other, just like a mother and her child. There is no distinction between strong and weak, and no one needs to rule the other. It should be very warm.
There is no fixed model for rural development, but it is difficult to rely on spontaneous changes in the countryside. The most important thing is to get the right people to go to the countryside.
The Shanghai Songjiang District traffic control department recently used electronic police to crack down on drivers using mobile phones while driving, and more than 30 cases were seized in a week.
With the popularity of smartphones, mobile phones are becoming more and more fun. Checking WeChat, posting on Weibo, even playing games and browsing Taobao have become normal. Many people seem to be unable to do without their mobile phones, even while driving.
The Road Traffic Safety Law explicitly prohibits using mobile phones while driving and defines it as &quot;behavior that hinders safe driving.&quot;
Unfortunately, due to the large number of offenders and the difficulty in obtaining evidence, this phenomenon has not been punished as it should be, and legal regulations have almost become a decoration.
If the traffic control departments are determined to &quot;declare war&quot; on the behavior of using mobile phones while driving and normalize this measure, this illegal behavior will definitely be curbed.
It is necessary to strictly manage household registration files, and establish electronic and paper files one by one for the household registration materials of people without household registration to ensure that the file information is complete and effective.
The public security organs should promptly report the situation of household registration of persons without household registration to relevant departments.
Policies and measures that are inconsistent with the spirit of these implementation opinions will be intensively reviewed, those that should be revised will be carefully revised, and those that should be abolished will be resolutely abolished.
In a collective greenhouse in Donglin Village, Taicang City, 48-year-old Wang Xuefen is leading workers to spray pesticides on pear trees.
The village has 150 acres of orchards and more than 10 tree species, requiring only 12 workers and 1 technical engineer.
Last year, the total was 50,000 yuan. At my age, I would definitely not be able to get this kind of money if I worked in a factory.
Last year, the village-level income of Donglin Village reached 22 million yuan, of which total agricultural income accounted for nearly half.
Village Secretary Su Qifang: The per capita planting area is increasing every year. It started from 50 acres and now exceeds 100 acres. The average benefit per mu is increasing every year, and there is room for growth in the income of professional farmers every year.
The shares are quantified to every villager. The biggest highlight of rural collective economic reform in southern Jiangsu is to clarify the property rights of rural collective operating assets and explore the separation of politics and economy.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperative organizations in Anzhen Street, Xishan District, Wuxi City &quot;separate accounts management&quot; with the village committees where they are located. The village committees perform rural public affairs management, while the cooperative organizations are mainly engaged in business operations.
The two institutions have two accounts and do not &quot;cross boundaries&quot; with each other to prevent corruption when village cadres participate in collective asset management.
Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Committee, said that Jiangsu will continue to promote the reform of community joint-stock cooperative systems, encourage farmers to develop jointly, and establish a village-level democratic power operation mechanism.
Zhu Baoping: Further advance the reform, engage in community share cooperation, quantify assets to members, fix them to farmers, and form clear property rights.
Through Internet+, farmers will be given the right to know, the right to participate in decision-making, and the right to supervise democratic management. This will indeed turn it into a standardized operating mechanism for joint-stock cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy in rural areas of southern Jiangsu has mainly formed four development models: asset leasing, enterprise shareholding, agricultural development, and joint development.
It is understood that overseas exhibitions have become an important platform to promote the construction of “One Belt, One Road” in Zhejiang Province.
The successful holding of these overseas exhibitions has accumulated valuable experience and a good foundation for continuing to explore emerging markets along the “Belt and Road” and building a comprehensive platform for overseas exhibitions.
Peak will always be oriented to enhance consumers&#39; sports needs, build a sports industry ecosystem, and accelerate the strategic upgrade from a single sports goods manufacturing company to a professional sports service company.
Hamill also said that 34 other people were injured and sent to hospital, including three firefighters who suffered minor injuries and have since been discharged.
He also appealed to residents of the apartment where the fire occurred to contact the authorities as some residents were still missing.
It is reported that Mariana Turay, who has lived in this apartment for 30 years, said: &quot;It seems like a bomb fell.&quot;
It is reported that it took the local fire brigade 1 hour and 45 minutes to extinguish the fire, and residents of nearby buildings were allowed to return to their homes a few hours later.
American Red Cross personnel estimate that about 100 people are homeless, and 60 to 70 of them are temporarily staying in shelters in nearby community centers. Most of them are Hispanic residents.
On August 11, the first Jinzhou Wetland Tourism and Culture Festival kicked off at the &quot;Hequan Lake&quot; in Jinzhou Oriental Huadicheng.
Since 2014, the revenue generated by the tourism industry has accounted for 10% of Jinzhou City’s GDP; in 2015, it reached 11.3%.
Oriental Huadicheng Wetland Hot Spring Tourist Area is located at No. 1, Linghai Section, Binhai Highway, Dayou Economic Zone, Linghai City, Jinzhou City. It is 70 kilometers away from Jinzhou City, 50 kilometers away from Linghai City, and 70 kilometers away from Panjin City.
The scenic area has indoor hot springs covering an area of 3,000 square meters and outdoor hot springs covering an area of 4,600 square meters.
Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: She started shooting with &quot;beautiful hands&quot; and her career has been &quot;reversed&quot; several times.
Zhang Donghong from Dongyuan Village, Xiang&#39;an District, Xiamen just replaced the old 29-inch TV at home with a large 65-inch TV a few days ago.
The daughter of an ordinary farmer is Zhang Binbin, who won the silver medal for China in the women&#39;s 50-meter rifle three-position final at the Rio Olympics on the evening of the 11th.
On the night of the 11th, in front of this new TV, Zhang Donghong and his wife, together with dozens of relatives and friends, witnessed the magical process of their daughter catching up all the way, from almost being eliminated in the preliminaries to almost making a huge comeback.
In the competition that day, Zhang Binbin was once ranked in the middle and lower reaches, and seemed to be very far away from the finals.
But his parents, relatives and friends did not give up and kept reading the live broadcast. Seeing that as other contestants completed the competition, Zhang Binbin&#39;s ranking improved all the way, and finally secured his seat in the finals. A burst of cheers erupted in his family.
In the final, Zhang Binbin once again ranked low, but his last few shots became more and more stable, and he won the silver medal only 0.2 rings behind the champion.
Zhang Binbin, who is 27 years old this year, has almost missed this hard-won silver medal several times in his 16-year shooting career.
His mother Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that when they were hesitating, Zhang Binbin found several &quot;novel readers&quot; from the same village.
These &quot;novel guests&quot; were children from the same village who were recommended to participate in the training camp at the same time, including Zhang Binbin&#39;s cousin.
Shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin took the initiative to return to school in Xiang&#39;an due to family difficulties and other reasons.
But after repeated efforts by his first coach Zhang Yajie, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again returned home because he could not see hope for the national team.
This time, not only coach Zhang Yajie, but also leaders and coaches from the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian Provincial Team came to the home and finally persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Just like yesterday&#39;s game, this Xiamen girl used persistence to achieve reversals on her shooting road.
&quot;Each coach has a different method of selecting players. When I saw Binbin&#39;s beautiful hands, I fell in love with him.&quot;
Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, although her daughter&#39;s score was not the best, her number of rings was very stable. This was also an important reason why Zhang Binbin attracted the coach.
In the process of training Zhang Binbin, what impressed Zhang Yajie the most was the input of this farm girl.
He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted long-lasting gun-raising training in standing shooting, requiring the team members not to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that his daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child. She has loved painting and homemade handmade toys since she was a child.
&quot;It turns out that I can make clothes and mend clothes at home, and Binbin will pick up some leftover materials to make dolls by herself.&quot;
She said that her daughter often sews handmade toys by herself, and because she is good at painting, she can always make the dolls&#39; facial features and clothing lifelike.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends less time with his family and spends more time away from home. He can only go home during holidays and usually relies on phone calls.
His parents said that whether in person or on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom talked about his hard work, but more often talked about happy things with his parents.
They rarely see their daughter, so their parents carefully store their daughter&#39;s childhood paintings and honors over the years at home.
Zhang Xiaolong showed his daughter&#39;s animation paintings to reporters, &quot;If she hadn&#39;t become a shooter, she would have continued painting.&quot;
In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin&#39;s house, there is a cabinet filled with medals, medals and certificates she has received.
Zhang Donghong arranged the medals and medals neatly, and put the certificates into folders for storage. &quot;These are the honors that Binbin has earned with more than ten years of hard work, and we all cherish them.&quot;
Recently, the Hebei Province Cixiao Fund sent 16,000 yuan in condolence money to six bereaved families in Xiaozuo, Taitou, and Guiquan villages in Jingxing County.
This is another act of condolences and care after the fund issued a message to the society to find &quot;the children who lost their relatives and the lonely elderly in the 7.19 floods.&quot;
Heavy rainfall on July 19 caused disasters in many places in Hebei Province, causing floods in some areas of the province, as well as deaths and missing persons.
The good man &quot;Lao Tie&quot; unfortunately died while helping to voluntarily drain water in the community, leaving behind a 2-year-old child and a pregnant wife. The touching story of the good man &quot;Lao Tie&quot; moved the entire provincial capital.
On August 4, staff from the Hebei Province Cixiao Fund and volunteers from the Hebei Brand Association came to the home of a good man named &quot;Lao Tie&quot; and handed over 3,200 yuan in love to his family.
When Ye Li, vice president of the Brand Association, learned about the current situation of &quot;Lao Tie&#39;s&quot; family, she immediately decided to launch a &quot;Charity Sale&quot; activity among the corporate members of the Brand Association to help &quot;Lao Tie&#39;s&quot; family overcome the difficulties.
Hebei Province Cixiao Fund, the full name of Hebei Province Voluntary Service Foundation Cixiao Fund, was initiated by the Hebei Brand Association Preparatory Committee and established in August 2015.
According to a report by Hong Kong&#39;s &quot;Oriental Daily&quot; on August 12, there are currently three major problems in diamond sales in the mainland, including false marking of diamond clarity that drives up selling prices, false marking of diamond weight, and no guarantee of after-sales service.
Antwerp is one of the world&#39;s largest diamond trading centers. The diamond cutting skills of local craftsmen are world-famous. The diamonds sold have undergone strict appraisal and are very popular among mainland ladies.
&quot;A small cloth bag, held in the palm of your hand, a small handful, worth nearly one million yuan,&quot; an aunt surnamed Liu who participated in purchasing diamonds described her experience in Antwerp in June this year to the mainland media.
She said she hid the diamond in her underwear and carried it with her to the toilet and shower for several days, making her very nervous when walking or sleeping.
She said that the diamond she bought in Antwerp cost about 55,000 yuan per carat, and the retail price of diamonds of the same quality in Xiamen was about 111,000 yuan.
She recently sold all the diamonds she bought on her behalf at a price plus 20%, making a huge profit of NT$200,000.
According to mainland customs regulations, diamonds are not supplies or necessities for travelers during their itinerary, so they are classified as goods and must be declared when entering and leaving the country. Otherwise, they may be classified as smuggling, and in serious cases they may be jailed.
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th local time, Downing Street, the British Prime Minister&#39;s Office, announced that British Prime Minister Theresa May will spend her summer vacation in Switzerland, but did not disclose the specific location of her vacation.
Some media said that after the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, the new British Prime Minister chose to vacation in Switzerland, a &quot;neutral country&quot; on the European continent, with some policy symbolism.
The British &quot;Guardian&quot; commented that the symbolism represented by Switzerland, a neutral country, played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister&#39;s first vacation destination.
The British &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; commented that Theresa May chose to vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time a British prime minister has vacationed in Switzerland since Margaret Thatcher.
The choice of the two female prime ministers is in contrast to the two male prime ministers, Blair and Cameron, who like to vacation in hotter places.
It is reported that the new British Prime Minister Theresa May will return to London on August 24, and a series of important tasks and activities await her.
The British Parliament will resume sitting on September 5. Among the issues debated include the online request for a second Brexit referendum.
The UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum on June 23, but the new British Prime Minister is unwilling to activate Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty regarding the withdrawal of member states from the EU before the end of the year.
There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage items in Huangshan City, ranking first in the province in terms of both type and quantity.
Since the intangible cultural heritage of Huizhou mainly relies on oral and face-to-face teaching, many intangible cultural heritage are on the verge of being lost, so it is imperative to use digital technology to preserve and protect them.
According to the main work arrangements of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People&#39;s Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to hear and review special work reports, and conduct special inquiries on the implementation of the Banking Supervision and Administration Law and serving local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research teams to conduct research in some cities to prepare for special inquiries.
Hua Jianhui pointed out that it was the first time in our province that the Standing Committee of the Provincial People&#39;s Congress heard and reviewed the special work reports of vertical management departments and conducted special inquiries. It was an active exploration to strengthen and expand the supervision work of the People&#39;s Congress.
At the exercise director&#39;s office in Kashgar, Xinjiang, following an order from the chief director, the armed police units stationed in Kashgar, Hotan, and Aksu quickly followed the guidance instructions, carried out mobile assembly, and headed for the exercise combat site.
China’s Mars plan is coming
Our country&#39;s Mars exploration mission will orbit, land, and patrol at one time, which has never been done before abroad.
Our country&#39;s Mars exploration and launch goal is to orbit, land, and patrol in one step. This task is quite difficult.
Because it takes 26 months for Mars exploration to reach a time window, experts are rigorously formulating engineering plans and striving to launch my country&#39;s first Mars probe within this window of 2020.
According to Xu Dazhe, although my country&#39;s aircraft have entered deep space, it is still indispensable to complete the Mars exploration mission. Exploring Mars means that China has truly entered the era of deep space exploration.
&quot;Only once every two or three years does Mars have the opportunity to be closest to the Earth. Launching a Mars probe at this point in time is the most energy-saving for the launch vehicle.&quot;
&quot;Considering the quality of the Mars probe, my country&#39;s Long March 5 carrier rocket will complete the launch mission.&quot;
Our country&#39;s Mars exploration mission will orbit, land, and patrol at once. This form has never been seen abroad. Foreign countries once planned to orbit and land at once, but the landing failed.
Mars exploration involves many technical fields. What is special is that although the Mars rover is a space probe, it has distinctive characteristics compared with ordinary space probes.
In other words, the Mars rover must have the ability to determine the driving route and detect obstacles and dangers.
Pang Zhihao, a researcher at the Fifth Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, said that the reason why humans are so interested in Mars exploration is because Mars exploration has important scientific and technological significance, and is even related to the future of mankind.
At present, Mars has become the most studied planet by humans besides the earth. The history of humans using space probes to explore Mars almost runs through the entire history of human spaceflight.
Therefore, humans hope to one day establish a residential base on Mars, eventually immigrating to Mars and turning it into a second home for humans.
A large number of signs also indicate that Mars was likely to be the same as the current Earth. It only took billions of years of evolution to become a thin atmosphere, lower temperature, and depleted water sources.
Therefore, exploration or manned landing on Mars for research can provide plans to prevent the earth from becoming a second Mars where humans cannot survive.
As of June 2016, a total of 114 lunar explorations and 43 Mars explorations had been carried out around the world.
However, since the 1990s, humans have conducted a total of 18 Mars explorations, while only 14 lunar explorations have been conducted.
There are currently 5 Mars orbiters and 2 Mars rovers in operation, but only 1 lunar orbiter and 1 lunar lander are in operation.
The world&#39;s major space powers have formulated exploration plans targeting the Mars system. It can be seen that today&#39;s Mars exploration is hotter than lunar exploration.
On November 5, 2013, India launched its first Mars probe &quot;Mangalyan&quot; and became the first country in Asia to successfully detect Mars.
&quot;Mangalian&quot; is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars, and to explore whether there is methane and signs of life on Mars.
The most difficult part of this mission is that after the probe enters the Martian atmosphere, the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration only have one chance.
According to Sun Zezhou, chief designer of the Mars probe at the General Headquarters of the Fifth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure of Mars is very low, only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth&#39;s surface, and has a high degree of uncertainty.
Scientists do not yet have a thorough understanding of factors such as its changes and storm characteristics.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to those on Earth in the summer, which will cause the solar energy received by the rover to drop sharply. A &quot;sleep&quot; mode must be designed for the rover to wait patiently for the dust storm to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere also reduces solar illumination, which poses problems in the energy supply for Mars exploration.
This requires the detector&#39;s solar wing area to be larger, and it needs to be constantly adjusted to strive to align with the direction of the sun.
Also, the gravity on the surface of Mars is only 38% of that of the Earth, but it is much greater than the gravity on the surface of the moon, so the detector needs more power.
&quot;The core and most difficult part of this Mars exploration mission is the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters the Martian atmosphere. There is only one chance, and success must be ensured.&quot;
Sun Zezhou said that due to the long distance between the Earth and Mars, the entire process cannot be controlled in real time by the ground, so it must be completed independently by the detector.
Since there is not that much propellant to offset such a high speed, when landing on Mars, deceleration depends on the Martian atmosphere. However, the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
Pang Zhihao said that generally speaking, the method of detecting Mars is similar to the method of detecting the moon, which is also &quot;circling, landing, patrolling, and returning&quot; to ultimately achieve the goal of manned landing on Mars.
Since Mars is much farther from the earth than the moon is, detecting Mars requires overcoming a series of more complex technical difficulties.
According to Taiwanese media reports, Taiwan’s “Executive President” Lin Chuan announced yesterday morning that the “Regulations on the Disposal of Improperly Acquired Property by Political Parties and Their Affiliated Organizations” will take effect today.
Kuomintang Vice Chairman Zhan Qixian said, &quot;A Kuomintang with a history of more than 100 years has social commitment and responsibility and will not collapse like this.&quot;
Lin Quan emphasized that if political parties, affiliated organizations or trustees violate the prohibition of punishment stipulated in the regulations, the committee will investigate and punish &quot;in accordance with the law&quot; in accordance with its authority.
Lin Quan also announced that the deputy chairman of the Inappropriate Party Property Committee will be Hong Peigen, Taiwan&#39;s &quot;Deputy Director of the Independent Commission Against Corruption&quot;.
He said that Gu Lixiong is the best choice to serve as the chairman of the Committee on Improper Party Assets. Hong Peigen’s past experience in investigating related major cases will be used as the basis for the committee to investigate related cases of improper Party assets.
Zhan Qixian believes that as long as there are still party assets today, no one will give you social donations. If all party assets are confiscated and taken away, the Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship. &quot;Today, if there is really none, there will be a chance to ask for it.&quot;
Zhan Qixian also emphasized that even if the Kuomintang&#39;s party assets are not completely confiscated or confiscated after the illegal party assets regulations are enacted, the remaining assets will still be donated as promised, so that the party assets will be returned to zero, and the party will start everything from scratch.
Original title: &quot;Corridor Doctor&quot; Lan Yuefeng lost the first instance lawsuit against CCTV host Wang Zhian for reputation infringement
Legal Evening News reported that because CCTV host Wang Zhian made remarks about the &quot;corridor doctor&quot; incident on Sina Weibo, Lan Yuefeng sued Wang Zhian and Beijing Weimeng Chuangke Network Technology Co., Ltd. to court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haidian Court pronounced its verdict on the case. It found that Wang Zhian and Weimeng Company did not constitute infringement and rejected all of Lan Yuefeng&#39;s claims.
In early 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhian investigated and found that although Lan Yuefeng, who had been sitting in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days, was portrayed by the media as a tragic hero suppressed by the system, these reports contained a lot of false information.
On March 29, 2014, the &quot;Corridor Doctor&quot; program produced by CCTV News Investigation was broadcast.
All the so-called excessive medical information reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media is not supported by evidence.
Wang Zhian also described in his real-name authentication Weibo that &quot;the reason why Lan Yuefeng has reached this point is due to his personality and his obvious paranoid personality.&quot;
Lan Yuefeng requested Wang Zhian to delete his Weibo, apologize to him, and pay 100,000 yuan in compensation for mental damage.
During the court hearing at that time, both parties had a heated debate over whether Wang Zhian had violated Lan Yuefeng&#39;s reputation rights.
Highlights on the 12th: The Chinese team is very busy at the start of the track and field competition, and the women’s football team is looking forward to a breakthrough
Cycling is expected to achieve a &quot;zero breakthrough&quot; in Olympic gold medals, while the women&#39;s football girls will challenge the two-time world champion German team, looking forward to an upset into the semi-finals.
Wang Zhen has been in outstanding form in the past two seasons. He won a silver medal at the World Athletics Championships in Beijing last year, and was promoted to the individual event championship at the World Team Walking Championships in May this year.
According to foreign media reports, 27-year-old South Korean female archery player Jang Hye-jin won the gold medal in the women&#39;s individual archery competition and won the Olympic gold medal after the team competition, becoming a double champion.
Zhang Huizhen is considered a late bloomer. She once regretted not getting a ticket for the last London Olympics, but now she proudly stands on the highest podium of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in the women&#39;s individual archery finals at the Samba Avenue Arena in Rio de Janeiro, defeating Germany&#39;s Lisa Onru with a total score of 6-2.
She only shot archery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school. It was not until she was 27 years old that she won her first individual gold medal at the World Cup in 2014. She is a player who became famous late.
Zhang Huizhen recalled, “Before I entered middle school, I was not good enough to participate in national competitions.
Zhang Huizhen only finished fourth in the London Olympics trials four years ago. She regretted losing her Olympic ticket and could only sit back and watch her colleague and friend Qi Fu win two gold medals.
Zhang Huizhen talked about her gold-winning speech after the award ceremony of the women&#39;s individual archery competition, &quot;I shot arrows one after another as much as possible until the end. Maybe it brought good results and I was satisfied.
The 28-year-old South Korean archery &quot;first sister&quot; and London Olympics individual archery gold medalist Qi Bobei won the bronze medal.
Qifubei lost to Zhang Huizhen in the semifinals and started a bronze medal competition with Mexico&#39;s Alejandra Valencia.
Qi Fubei burst into tears after securing the bronze medal. One can imagine the burden he silently endured during this period.
The first is that the coaching staff has accumulated rich experience through continuous research, and the second is scientific training methods, which need to be accumulated over a long period of time.
The archery team uses military training and night walks through cemeteries to help members focus and maintain a sense of normalcy.
Although it has not been confirmed yet, many sources have said that Apple’s 2016 autumn conference will be held in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming.
Although Apple has not responded, news about the functions and configurations of the new iPhone have been released one after another, and there are even pictures of the iPhone 7 &quot;real model&quot; online.
The new generation of iPhone can be described as &quot;much-anticipated&quot;. It is hot, in short supply, and there is money but no goods... If you want to buy genuine products as soon as possible, you must choose a good channel, such as Suning.
This adds to people&#39;s disappointment with the new phone, &quot;It&#39;s longer, but it can&#39;t project holographic images at all! This generation of iPhone sucks.&quot;
iPhone7, like other iPhones, was accompanied by countless secrets before it was born.
In addition, multiple sources claim that the new generation iPhone will cancel the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging interface, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple allowed headphone manufacturers to produce headphone products connected through the charging interface.
These messages may be true or false, and the answer will not be revealed until Apple’s 2016 autumn conference.
But this does not prevent industry insiders from being optimistic about the prospects of iPhone7 - many people believe that iPhone7 will most likely become Apple&#39;s last major upgrade of the iPhone series.
Although judging from the data released not long ago by market research organization IDC, the iPhone&#39;s market share has declined.
Among them, Goldman Sachs maintains a &quot;buy&quot; rating on Apple&#39;s stock, while analysts at BMO believe that iPhone 7 will achieve historic sales results.
At the same time, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple&#39;s future revenue growth will likely exceed 20%, which is entirely due to the launch of iPhone7.
7% of the respondents said they planned to buy iPhone7, while only 4% planned to buy iPhone6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of the users who currently own iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase iPhone 7, which is a quite high proportion.
Secondly, some experts have analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhones from generation to generation.
According to statistics, among all iPhone users, about 26% have not changed their phones for 2 years, which means that almost 120 million users have used iPhones for 2 years.
Some media said that during the production of iPhone 7, Taiwan suffered several earthquakes. &quot;The extent of damage to TSMC&#39;s production facilities was beyond imagination and may have an impact on the initial supply of iPhone 7.&quot;
The contradiction between supply and demand will affect ordinary users. It is time to choose a good channel and buy genuine iPhone7 at a low price as soon as possible.
According to people familiar with the matter, Suning executives have met frequently with Apple recently in order to prepare sufficient supply.
The operator has reached an agreement with Suning. It is foreseeable that with the in-depth cooperation between the two parties, it will inevitably bring lower prices and more considerate services to users.
&quot;At the lowest price, consumers may be able to buy iPhone 7 for only 7 yuan a day.&quot;
Sufficient supply and various discounts make buying iPhone7 no longer &quot;stressful&quot;, and Suning&#39;s logistics will turn this beauty into a more intuitive experience.
Maybe, you will receive a call in the middle of the night, &quot;Hello, Suning.com, your iPhone 7 has arrived.&quot;
The organizers hope that through the cultural relics exhibition, local people can learn more about the long-standing Chinese culture, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
Barcelona&#39;s &quot;Ming Dynasty Cultural Relics Exhibition&quot; is part of a European tour that will last until early October.
Hua Xia Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank released their 2016 semi-annual reports yesterday. In the second quarter, CSI Financial Holdings once again increased its stake in these banks.
Among them, CSI Financial Holdings increased its holdings of 29.2931 million shares in Hua Xia Bank. By the end of June, the number of shares held by CSI Financial Holdings in Hua Xia Bank increased to 387 million shares, and its shareholding ratio also increased from 3.35% to 3.62%.
According to calculations by China Merchants Securities, excluding transfers, CSI Financial also increased its holdings of 38 million shares of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank in the second quarter, increasing its number of shares to nearly 600 million shares, accounting for 2.77% of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank&#39;s shares.
Recently, the Hebo Garden in Shizibang, Zhengfu Village, Tongxiang City, Zhejiang Province was officially opened to villagers and tourists.
The garden consists of more than 100 small circular ponds, and about 300 varieties of ornamental lotus, water lilies, etc. are planted.
The rural lotus industry is both ornamental, recreational and economical, and has become a highlight of the local new rural development.
According to foreign media reports, the &quot;green pool&quot; incident at the Rio Olympics has attracted much attention recently because the water in the diving pool turned from blue to green.
However, on the morning of the 10th, the water in the water polo competition pool adjacent to the diving pool also turned green.
The Australian water polo player said after the game that his eyes stung and he wanted to cry.
Previously, Rio Olympic officials confirmed that the pool water turned green and said that the discoloration of the pool water was due to the weakening of alkalinity and would not affect the health of athletes.
But Australian athletes said their eyes stung after their victory against Japan in the water polo pool.
After the water in the diving pool turned green at the earliest, the competition organizers worked overtime on the evening of the 9th to deal with the problem of the diving pool, but on the morning of the 10th they discovered that the color of the water polo pool had also changed rapidly.
During the match between Australia and Japan, the environmental conditions in the water polo pools gradually deteriorated, but officials emphasized that they would restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colors on the 11th.
Rio Olympics spokesman Mario Andrada said: &quot;Yesterday afternoon, the alkalinity of the water in the diving pool first became weaker.&quot;
&quot;We learned about a range of possible causes of discoloration in pool water and the alkalinity of the water.&quot;
The Aquatics Center conducted a series of water quality tests and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the pool to ensure that water quality standards were met. &quot;
&quot;We have been following normal procedures these days, but we may have overlooked the impact that more athletes may have on water quality.&quot;
&quot;But the change in water color definitely has no impact on human health, especially on athletes.&quot;
&quot;This independent team confirmed our assessment and the steps we took to restore the pool to its normal color and chemical state.&quot;
&quot;We had hoped that the pool would be back to normal color in the morning, but the rain has affected the speed of recovery.&quot;
According to Taiwan&#39;s &quot;Central News Agency&quot;, an explosion occurred in a suburban prison in Metro Manila last night, injuring the warden and killing 10 inmates, reportedly including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN TV reported that the incident occurred at the Paranaque jail at around 9 o&#39;clock last night, but the police did not provide a preliminary statement until 2 o&#39;clock this morning.
The police said that the 10 prisoners asked to see the warden to complain about their transfer. However, the two sides did not agree, and some prisoners threw grenades, causing an explosion.
The prison has not announced the names of the dead prisoners, but GMA TV reported that they included two Chinese.
As of 8 a.m., prison authorities had not yet provided a detailed explanation, including how the inmates obtained the grenades.
Yesterday, police in the central Philippines entered the regional prison in Leyte Province and shot and killed an inmate who &quot;attempted to attack the police.&quot;
Urumqi regulates the business order of the individual tourism market and travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists
Xinjiang has now entered the peak tourism season. In order to regulate the operating order of the individual tourist market, the Urumqi Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment and the Municipal Transportation Management Bureau Law Enforcement Detachment yesterday investigated the irregularities in the use of tourist vehicles in the individual tourist market and the low rate of contract signing between travel agencies and tourists. Conduct investigation.
At 8 o&#39;clock yesterday morning, about 10 buses full of tourists were parked around the Kempinski Hotel. Most of these buses were individual groups heading to Tianchi for a day trip.
&quot;Hello, I am from the Urumqi Tourism Bureau. Have you signed a contract with this travel agency?&quot;
Yu Bin, a staff member of the law enforcement detachment of Urumqi Municipal Transportation Management Bureau, said: &quot;Off-site tourist buses and shuttle buses operate tourist passenger transport projects in the Urumqi market, and they have no business qualifications.&quot;
&quot;The penalty for operating outside the scope is between 30,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan. If the driver does not have a business qualification certificate, the fine is 2,000 yuan.&quot;
It is understood that the Urumqi Tourism Law Enforcement Department has previously conducted inspections on places where individual tourists gather, such as West Park and Hongshan.
Based on the results of the two inspections, Ma Qi, deputy leader of the Urumqi Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment, said: &quot;The first is safety, and the second is standardization. There is nothing trivial about tourist vehicles. If something goes wrong, everyone will be injured and killed.&quot;
&quot;We and the transportation management team continue to inspect the market and regulate travel agencies&#39; car use to ensure the safety of tourists.&quot;
On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the performance of the national economy in July 2016.
Sheng Laiyun, spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics and director of the National Economic Comprehensive Statistics Department, said that in July, the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy slowed down, but it was still operating within a reasonable range.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics show that fixed asset investment growth, total imports and other data fell back in July.
Sheng Laiyun said that regarding the performance of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow a sentence once said by the Prime Minister, &quot;There are fluctuations in the situation, but the trend is still improving.&quot; This can better summarize the characteristics of the economic performance in July.
He explained that &quot;tangible fluctuations&quot; meant that the growth rate of some economic indicators did drop in July.
Because the domestic and foreign economies were still undergoing deep adjustments in July, the international situation was complex and changeable, and the recovery of the world economy was less than expected, so export pressure was still relatively high.
Judging from the domestic situation, the entire economy is still in a critical stage of adjustment. The pain of adjustment is being released. The economy is facing considerable downward pressure, so some indicators have fluctuated.
Sheng Laiyun pointed out that there was another special situation in July. Floods were relatively serious, and high temperatures and hot weather had some impact on production and operations in some areas.
According to the latest information released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people across the country were affected by the disaster, with direct economic losses exceeding 200 billion yuan.
Judging from industry, investment, and transportation-related indicators, these regions have been affected to varying degrees.
The growth rate of cargo turnover in July dropped 3.6 percentage points from the previous month. Floods have had a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
Judging from these factors, it is normal and expected for some indicators to fluctuate in July.
He said that &quot;the trend is still improving&quot; means that although the economic growth rate has slowed down, the economic operation is generally stable, and the general trend of steady progress and steady improvement has not changed.
The CPI rose by 1.8% in July and 0.2% month-on-month; from January to July, the CPI rose by 2.1%, so the price situation is generally stable.
According to the statistics of high temperature weather in various districts and counties on the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal website, except for Youyang, the rest of the city can receive varying degrees of high temperature subsidies.
At present, at least 28 provinces across the country have clarified the subsidy payment standards, but the standards for each province and city are different. Chongqing receives high temperature subsidies in the form of high temperature working day allowances.
If the temperature is above 35℃ and below 37℃, the payment will be at a standard of no less than 10 yuan per person per day; if the temperature is above 37℃, the payment will be at a standard of no less than 15 yuan per person per day.
Workers working in high temperatures above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan/day in monthly allowances (except for workers who already enjoy high-temperature job allowances in accordance with the law).
According to this standard, Kaizhou, which had the most hot weather days last month, can receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou, which has the fewest days, can receive 80 yuan. However, since the highest temperature in Youyang did not meet the high temperature standard, there is no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many units would use refreshing drinks to offset the high temperature allowance. The Municipal Work Safety Bureau said that this behavior was not in line with current measures.
If work is stopped or working hours are shortened due to hot weather, the employer shall not deduct or reduce workers&#39; wages.
The Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau stated that employees who encounter high temperatures but do not receive high temperature allowances can fight for their legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to complain.
If the employing unit refuses to pay the high temperature allowance, the worker may complain to the human resources and social security department at or above the county level where the employer is located.
At the same time, since the high temperature allowance is part of the salary, not a benefit, it must be included in the total salary and personal tax deducted.
Therefore, high temperature allowance is not within the scope of the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be replaced by physical items such as drinks.
The newly built Urumqi Station is located in the high-speed railway area of Urumqi, with a total construction area of approximately 100,000 square meters.
The first and second floors above ground are for the entrance, waiting hall, office and commercial buildings, and the first underground floor is the outbound floor.
At present, Urumqi Station is the largest comprehensive transportation hub in Xinjiang. It integrates high-speed rail, rail transit, buses, taxis, etc., and can realize seamless connection of various transfer methods.
There are three ticket halls on the north and south sides of the platform level and the north side of the exit level, equipped with 39 manual ticket windows and 34 automatic ticket machines.
In terms of ticket checking, there are 30 channels on the east and west sides of the waiting hall. Passengers can quickly check and wait according to the ticket gate number on the ticket.
If you need help, you can press the 41 call buttons set up in the station to choose from and get timely service.
Starting from July 1st, passenger trains from the old passenger station, that is, Urumqi South Station, will run to Urumqi Station in stages.
In other words, all high-speed trains and 30 pairs of trains out of Xinjiang can stop at Urumqi Station.
Now you can buy tickets at both stations, and the train travel time between them is about 10 minutes. Passengers need to pay attention to the specific names of the origin and destination stations on the ticket.
The official launch of Urumqi&#39;s new passenger station will become an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national comprehensive transportation city and promote the construction of the &quot;Silk Road Economic Belt&quot; and new areas.
Gracia is a cute female toucan, exuding the atmosphere of a tropical rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, Toucan Gracia and her story have long been a household name.
At a press conference on August 10, Gracia finally appeared after recovering from the operation, showing off her brand new 3D printed plastic beak.
This toucan, whose beak was broken off a year and a half ago and was dying, has finally been given a new lease of life.
This day not only announces that it has recovered 100% to health, it is also the day that it moves into a luxurious aviary and meets its human friends who care about it.
Gracia was a little shy when she first entered her new home, but soon she became lively, rolling and playing in the water basin and eating grapes with her new beak.
To remind people of the damage it had suffered, technicians did not color its new beak, but retained the original white color of the 3D printing material.
The outside of the beak is a thin sheath of horn, and the inside is hollow, with only some thin bony support rods arranged staggered.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan&#39;s beak is fragile and can shatter when injured.
The animal rescue center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to make several &quot;test beaks&quot; for Gracia, and finally created the &quot;perfect beak&quot; that best suited her.
Gracia is now able to use her new beak proficiently to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains.
&quot;The design of the final product took about 2 months, and it only took 4 or 5 hours to print it.&quot;
&quot;3D printing is not a future technology. It has actually entered our lives.&quot; Thomas Lange, chairman of the American SG3D Printing Company, said in an interview with Xinhua International reporters.
In January 2015, a toucan named Gracia was found covered in blood on a farm in Gracia, Alajuela Province, central Costa Rica.
At that time, its upper beak was brutally broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and was in critical condition.
After Gracia&#39;s tragic story was reported by the media, it aroused a wave of calls against animal cruelty in Costa Rica and abroad.
People are calling for stricter animal protection laws and greater punishment for abusers.
People came spontaneously and tried their best to help Gracia return to her pre-injury life as much as possible.
Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, participated in the design of Gracia’s upper beak.
&quot;Gracia&#39;s situation is very special. The remaining part of its upper beak is less than 1 centimeter, so it brings many difficulties to install a new beak.&quot;
&quot;We first scanned Gracia, then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the remaining part of its upper beak, and fixed it to its upper beak with glue.&quot;
&quot;This can reduce further invasive damage to Gracia.&quot; Lange told Xinhua International reporters.
Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean Gracia&#39;s beak every day to prevent infection.
Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved the famous documentary director Paula Heredia and Discovery News Channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded every detail of Gracia&#39;s process of installing her new beak and recorded a documentary &quot;Toucan Country,&quot; which was broadcast on the Animal Planet channel this month.
The documentary &quot;Toucan Country&quot; shows people how a little toucan can change a country and how it can get citizens to participate in the fight against animal cruelty.
Core tip: Japanese oil companies are especially wary of the rise of China&#39;s small independent refineries known as &quot;teapots.&quot;
Reference News Network reported on August 12 that Japanese media said that Japan’s largest oil company JX Energy believes that “China’s export expansion is one of the reasons for the sluggish market.
Japanese oil companies are especially wary of the rise of small independent refineries in China, known as &quot;teapots.&quot;
The quality of China&#39;s petroleum products is gradually approaching that of Japan&#39;s oil products due to the Chinese government&#39;s strengthening of environmental protection regulations.
Before obtaining a crude oil import license, the &quot;Teapot Refinery&quot; generally imports heavy oil with high sulfur content from Russia and other places for refining.
The produced petroleum products have high sulfur content and poor oil quality, which has become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining a crude oil import license, the Teapot Refinery was able to import crude oil from Oman and Russia with lower sulfur content, and the quality of its petroleum products also improved.
Dongran General Petroleum Company said, “As China’s domestic petroleum product quality standards continue to improve, the capacity of oil refining equipment has also improved.
As a result, the quality of China&#39;s exported petroleum products has gradually reached the same level as Japan (the world&#39;s highest quality).&quot;
JX Energy stated that &quot;after the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia,&quot; competing with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although &quot;Japan&#39;s high-grade oil&quot; is facing a crisis, the response strategy adopted by Japanese oil companies is only to &quot;pay attention to market conditions while exporting to profitable areas.&quot;
As China&#39;s exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on Asian market conditions, there is increasing attention to the Teapot Refinery.
The 2016 Yangzi Evening News Liqun Sunshine Student Aid Campaign was launched on May 26. After two months of registration, the total number of poor students who applied for scholarships reached more than 800.
During the student assistance process, more than 1.2 million yuan in social donations have been received (disclosed in five batches), which can help at least 240 disadvantaged students realize their dream of going to university.
At present, donations are still continuing, and this newspaper calls on the society to continue to lend a helping hand so that more children from difficult families can receive funding and care from the society.
In order to ensure the fairness, openness and transparency of student aid actions, this newspaper will publish the basic information of students in batches from today on. Today, we will publish the 1st to 100th students and accept the supervision of readers.
Liqun Sunshine Student Aid Action is a well-known charity brand in China. The Yangtze Evening News Liqun Sunshine Student Aid Action has been launched in Jiangsu since 2003 and has supported more than 4,000 poor students.
The funding scope of this activity is for freshmen admitted to the college entrance examination, excluding tuition-free majors; students with both good character and academic performance and whose families are poor.
The Bureau of Statistics said New Zealand&#39;s population growth had only exceeded 2% in 1974 and during the &quot;baby boom&quot; peak periods of the 1950s and early 1960s.
As of June this year, New Zealand&#39;s net inflow of immigrants in the 12 months was 69,100, becoming the main driving force for New Zealand&#39;s population growth in recent years.
In addition, during the same period of time, the natural increase in New Zealand&#39;s population was 28,200.
Data show that in the past 10 years, New Zealand&#39;s average annual net inflow of immigrants was 21,800, and its average annual natural population growth was 32,300.
From the perspective of population structure, the large influx of immigrants means that the proportion of the &quot;working-age population&quot; aged 15 to 39 is gradually expanding.
In the 12 months to June 2016, New Zealand&#39;s working-age population increased by 3.6% to 1.58 million.
At the same time, the elderly population aged 65 and above also increased by 3.6%, reaching 700,000.
At about 10 o&#39;clock yesterday morning, the X9003 international freight train departed from Xi&#39;an Xinzhu Station and headed for Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The launch of this train marks that the Xi&#39;an Railway Bureau has successfully exceeded 10,000 trains since it launched the Central Asia International Freight Train in 2013.
It is understood that the goods transported by this freight train cover six categories: industrial raw materials, machinery and equipment, industrial spare parts, building materials, food, and light industrial products, with a total of 206 varieties.
As of August 11 this year, a total of 221 Central Asia trains and 10,009 vehicles have been operated at Xinzhu Station, and a total of 338,000 tons of export cargo have been shipped, including 84 trains in 2016, a year-on-year increase of 47%.
It is understood that the goods carried by the Central Asia Express on its first trip were all &quot;Made in Shaanxi&quot;, and now it has attracted a large number of foreign goods sources to actively list.
As of the end of July, the container arrivals and departures of Central Asia trains exceeded 64,000 TEUs, an increase of 8% compared with the same period in 2015.
With the increasing number of China-Asia freight trains, the freight volume of Xi&#39;an Railway Bureau&#39;s Xinzhu Station has increased year by year.
In 2015, the annual freight throughput of Xinzhu Station was 2.477 million tons. As of August 10, 2016, the freight dispatch volume had reached 1.531 million tons, an increase of 6.7% over the same period last year.
In order to meet the needs of future development, the Xi&#39;an Railway Bureau has launched a construction plan for the Xi&#39;an Xinzhu Railway Comprehensive Logistics Center centered on Xinzhu Station, and is striving to build a modern Xinzhu Railway Comprehensive Logistics Park.
An Indian uncle who just experienced the shock of landing in the belly of a plane at Dubai International Airport last week won a $1 million jackpot at the same airport this week.
Mohammad Bashir Abdul Hedar, an Indian who has lived in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, has the habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns to his country.
His 21-year-old son was paralyzed due to an accidental fall when he was 13 days old. He has been working hard to repay the loan for his son&#39;s medical expenses.
&quot;Escaping the plane crash was God giving me a second life and giving me this money to do good,&quot; Hedahl said.
Although it is already the beginning of autumn, the power of &quot;autumn tiger&quot; seems to be no less than that of summer.
Ultraviolet rays not only darken the skin of students, but also cause sunburn. How can the skin survive military training smoothly without getting sunburned?
Sunscreen packages are generally marked with SPF and PA. SPF refers to the sun protection index, which is against UVB ultraviolet rays. Our common SPF indexes are 15, 30, 50, etc.
Products marked with PA are for UVA, so that the sunscreen will play a more effective role. Usually, the intensity of PA is represented by +, and one more + indicates that the effective protection time is extended.
Oily skin should choose water-based sunscreen products with strong penetration, and sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose cream-based sunscreen products; there are generally no strict regulations for normal skin, and it is a burden to apply any skin care products to sensitive skin. It is recommended to choose purely physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance as it takes time for sunscreen products to fully penetrate into the skin.
Military training requires a long period of sun exposure. Sunscreen needs to be applied every two hours to have a lasting effect. Don&#39;t be lazy.
Since your skin has just been irritated by the sun, do not use whitening products immediately after returning from military training.
After exposure to the sun during military training, if possible, ice cubes wrapped in a towel can be used to cool the burned skin to slow down the local heat.
Farmers who purchase agricultural machinery during the exhibition will continue to implement the cumulative subsidy policy. Farmers who purchase agricultural machinery can receive up to 40% of the subsidy.
This exhibition attracts global investment and exhibitions, especially increasing the invitation to countries along the “Belt and Road” and target market countries.
This exhibition strives to complete 60 investment signing projects, introduce capital of 22 billion yuan, and sign more than 160 trade contracts with a contract value of 3.2 billion yuan.
It is reported that the reason why the &quot;Hunan Expo&quot; has been settled in Loudi for seven consecutive years is that Loudi City, Hunan Province has a strong manufacturing industry foundation and a long history of industrial development.
As the host of the &quot;Hunan Expo&quot;, Loudi has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
The &quot;Hunan Expo&quot; has become an important platform for the local area to cultivate the development of characteristic industries and promote characteristic industries to go abroad.
On some nights, the ionosphere is filled with free electrons, which means radio signals can travel farther.
According to a report on the website of the US monthly magazine Popular Science on August 11, the US Air Force is interested in replicating this effect.
While a stable ionosphere with lots of free electrons could help people listen to a college radio station at the edge of its range, that might not be what the Air Force is interested in.
An electron-filled ionosphere means radios used by the military have a greater range, and it may provide some protection for Global Positioning System (GPS) signals from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to create an on-demand fleet of CubeSats that can bolster the ionosphere when needed.
But first, the teams contracting with the Air Force must prove that the science will work.
Industry data shows that the total coal production capacity in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons, and the country&#39;s coal production capacity was 1.8 billion tons.
In the past ten years, the State Council has issued five notices to eliminate excess and backward production capacity.
Although the coal industry was not targeted in the first four times, the target industries were directly related to the coal industry.
From November last year to January this year, the price of 5,500 kcal thermal coal in Qinhuangdao hovered at a low of 370 yuan/ton for a long time, and 90% of coal companies fell into losses.
Since February, coal prices have gradually recovered. Recently, Qinhuangdao thermal coal prices have risen for four consecutive weeks, rising to a 16-month high, once climbing to 436 yuan per ton, nearly 70 yuan higher than at the beginning of the year.
As prices rebound, concerns arise from all walks of life: Will a group of small coal mines resume work and production?
In this regard, Kuang Xianming, director of the Economics Institute of the China (Hainan) Reform and Development Research Institute, conducted an analysis and interpretation.
Kuang Xianming: Overcapacity reduction has attracted great attention from all parties. The report card on overcapacity reduction in the coal industry announced today has indeed made everyone worried.
These three superficial factors still reflect the reason why the transformation of our growth mode has lagged behind in the past, that is, the government-led growth mode has not yet undergone a fundamental transformation.
Second, this is also directly related to the advancement of local governments. In the process of overcapacity reduction, funds and corresponding supporting measures must be in place. From this aspect, the differences between different regions are indeed relatively large.
Third, if some provinces that are currently progressing slowly have to catch up in the second half of the year, they may face greater risks.
In this case, relying on central government subsidies and subsidies to promote the process of overcapacity reduction may have certain negative effects.
First of all, cutting overcapacity is not simply about total volume control.
Our purpose is to eliminate backward production capacity, promote structural optimization, and reconstruct the entire coal industry&#39;s new business format.
In the process of deploying overcapacity reduction, local governments must combine overcapacity reduction with the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry and vigorously develop related service industries.
Second, if we want to complete this year&#39;s overcapacity reduction task within this year, we still need to give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we must strengthen the protective role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to employment issues, we must strengthen employment skills training for employees and workers.
“The reason for the decline in the ranking is the deterioration of foreign investors’ expectations for Brazil’s GDP development in the medium term.”
In 2015, Brazil&#39;s participation in global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.
The Credit Suisse International Investment Attractiveness Index includes four sub-indexes: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment volume.
In 2015, Brazil&#39;s international direct investment was US$64.6 billion, down from US$73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, &quot;greenfield investment&quot; (the investment model of investing and setting up factories abroad) in Brazil was US$17.9 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 2.1%.
&quot;There are 288 &#39;greenfield investment&#39; projects in Brazil, compared with the annual average of 314 from 2003 to 2014.&quot;
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached US$33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10% compared with the same period last year.
Original title: Canadian police kill IS supporter: Preparations for homemade bomb attack in downtown are nearing completion
The taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to Driver&#39;s home before police arrived.
Canadian police said at a news conference on Wednesday that they had received information including a &quot;martyrdom video&quot; provided by the FBI of the young man about to carry out the attack.
According to Deutsche Welle, the video showed a man wearing a black balaclava reciting the Quran, mentioning crimes against Muslims and vowing to launch an attack on a Canadian city soon.
He said in the video that the attack would occur within 72 hours and during peak hours.
This incident was the first time since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office last year that the police killed a terror suspect before the incident.
The upgraded Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal branch channels Laowanfu River and Beidaliu Channel will collect tolls from September 1.
These two tributary waterways are being reconstructed and constructed using social financing methods, and the fees have been approved by relevant departments of the provincial government.
The Laowanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang and Yutai, and then enters the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal via Nanyang Lake, with a total length of 32.5 kilometers.
According to the needs of navigation, the Laowanfu River channel has been maintained and reconstructed, and local water depths have been dredged, and local sharp bends have been cut and straightened, so that navigation conditions have been improved.
The waterway flows through Jinxiang County and Rencheng District, passes through Nanyang Lake and enters the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, with a total length of 19 kilometers.
The reconstruction project of the two waterways started construction in February 2011 and completed the handover and acceptance in January 2015. The main investment, construction and operation entity is the Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center.
In accordance with the principle of &quot;loan construction, fee repayment&quot;, Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center collects waterway tolls based on the charging standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.
Among them, the basic toll is charged at RMB 1.75/dwt, and the mileage toll is charged at RMB 0.05/km DWT.
The toll collection period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
The reporter learned from the Jining Port and Navigation Bureau that there are currently four toll channels in Jining, namely the Zhushui River Channel, the Baima River Channel, the Beidaliu Channel, and the Laowanfu River Channel.
The four waterways are tributary channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, and they have all been upgraded using social financing.
The Zhushui River channel upgrading and reconstruction project is the first project to adopt the &quot;government + market&quot; model for the construction of inland river port and shipping infrastructure in Shandong Province. The government accounts for the main investment and social funds supplement the funding gap.
Branch waterways such as the Baima River, Laowanfu River, and Beidaliu River adopt a purely market-oriented operation method.
Funds allocated by the national finance cannot meet the needs of project construction, which restricts the progress of waterway upgrades.
The use of social funds for the construction of public infrastructure meets the requirements of national policies and has also become a way to break the financial bottleneck.
Ning Zetao&#39;s performance in the 100-meter freestyle semifinals has left many Chinese viewers speechless.
But in the 50-meter freestyle preliminaries, Ning Zetao once again refreshed people&#39;s &quot;bottom line.&quot;
In fact, the 50-meter freestyle is not Ning Zetao&#39;s main event. His performance and best results at the Kazan World Championships also determine that it is unlikely that he will make a breakthrough in this event.
Sure enough, Hong Kong&#39;s authoritative media &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao&#39;s failure was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors off the court may have had a great impact on his thoughts on the future, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment industry.
After the World Championships in Kazan, Ning Zetao instantly became an internet celebrity with his superb looks and good results.
As a result, titles such as &quot;National Husband&quot;, &quot;Little Fresh Meat&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Boy&quot; have also become labels on him.
All kinds of business activities come to your doorstep, and the wonderful money path becomes a glittering avenue.
Under such circumstances, even if Ning Zetao chooses to retire and join the entertainment industry at this time, it is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly feasible path.
After all, he is only 23 years old. After some training, he can definitely star in one or two TV series based on his popularity.
But Ning Zetao needs to see if he is qualified enough compared with these seniors?
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the 21-year-old Liu Xuan had reached the end of her athletic career.
Liu Xuan&#39;s beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered by people, and also laid the foundation for her future entry into the entertainment industry.
After retiring, Liu Xuan starred in many TV series and established her own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in the single and double ten-meter platform competitions in two Olympic Games and won 2 gold medals and 2 silver medals.
However, after losing to his teammate Hu Jia in the singles ten-meter platform competition at the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang&#39;s competitive status declined and it was revealed that he was expelled from the diving team.
He and his daughter participated in variety shows such as &quot;Where Are We Going, Dad&quot;, which made him even more eye-catching.
The former golden generation of gymnastics Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in various variety shows with high profile.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led China to win the 2008 Olympic men&#39;s team championship. Yang Wei even won the individual all-around gold medal twice and was called the all-around king.
Chen Yibing also became the ring king while leading China to the 2012 Olympic team championship.
After suffering a misjudgment and losing the gold medal at the London Olympics, Chen Yibing&#39;s magnanimous behavior also won him countless fans.
However, the main focus of these athletes is still on the competition field, and they only scratch the surface of variety shows - just touch it and leave.
But whether you are a retired or active athlete, to be favored by the entertainment industry, you need to have outstanding results as a guarantee.
After all, when an athlete enters a new field, both his abilities and connections are blank.
Even for &quot;old people&quot; like Tian Liang and Liu Xuan who have been in the entertainment industry for many years, when ordinary audiences mention them, they think more of their performance in the Olympics.
Newcomers such as Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng are all introduced as &quot;Olympic champions&quot; when they appear on variety shows.
Compared with the above people, Ning Zetao&#39;s reputation as a world swimming championship champion is still a little thin.
What&#39;s more, compared to the retirement of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others, if Ning Zetao retired at the age of 23 after a slight setback in his sports career, the negative impact on his image would probably be immeasurable.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people&#39;s requirements are &quot;not to be victorious in every battle, but to be unafraid of hardships and dangers.&quot; Ning Zetao is still far from this point.
To put it bluntly, Ning Zetao is handsome and can win the support of thousands of idiot fans simply by relying on his looks.
If you don&#39;t have any skills and rely only on appearance, trying to do well in the entertainment industry is no more difficult than training hard to find your proper form.
The choice of life path depends entirely on personal wishes, but Ning Zetao should know exactly how to choose.
On the surface, online social platforms expand social circles and reduce people’s loneliness.
The sphere of influence of online social networking is becoming more and more extensive, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contact, but also penetrating into offline real life circles, quietly changing the current social life of the people.
The benefits of online social networking are obvious, such as convenience and speed, so it is especially popular among young people.
A survey on the social habits of college students showed that 57% of college students use mobile phones for more than 5 hours a day, and they basically cannot leave their phones in their daily lives.
“Social networks have the characteristics of low cost, fast transmission speed, and multiple people communicating at the same time, which meet the needs of contemporary college students.”
Expanding the circle of interpersonal relationships, having more equal conversations, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love online chatting more and more.
Newcomers who have just joined the company love to communicate with colleagues online. “Because we are new to the company and we are not familiar with each other. Through likes and comments on social platforms, our relationship is much closer than before.”
People who love making friends also often communicate online. “I lost contact with my friends for a while due to some misunderstandings, but then we started to talk a few words in a large group before we became more friendly again.”
IT engineer Wu Yan is an in-depth online social enthusiast. Most of his social life takes place online, and his online contacts are several times the number of people in his offline circle of friends.
Wu Yan himself admitted that he is more &quot;at ease&quot; on the Internet.
“You can reply to your friends when it’s convenient for you, because you have a lot of time to think about your words, and your expression can be clearer.”
&quot;Hidden under the ID, you come and go to avoid face-to-face interpersonal collisions. Not only do you have room for maneuver, but you even give each other more time and space to think about your words and actions.&quot;
“People with different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speak, and all the social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace.”
However, Wu Yan&#39;s friend Xiaopeng thinks that Wu Yan in life is a &quot;pretty boring otaku&quot;.
Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group. Because they were both active speakers, they quickly became familiar with each other.
Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan was completely different from those on the Internet. His speech was boring and he did not take the initiative to express opinions. He kept saying &quot;Haha, okay, right?&quot; or &quot;I want to check this online.&quot;
Lingshui police have now intervened in the investigation, and the Lingshui transportation department will also intensify efforts to rectify illegal operating vehicles.
&quot;The police have not yet investigated the conflict on August 4. At about 0:00 on August 11, the taxis of two other drivers were smashed again at their residences.&quot;
&quot;Nowadays, most tricycles operate illegally at night. I hope the competent authorities can also increase their efforts to rectify this.&quot;
Nanhai.com reporters learned from the Lingshui Li Autonomous County Public Security Bureau that the police have accepted the reports of these two cases. The causes of the two cases, who committed them, and whether they are related are all under further investigation.
Wang Wenyi, director of the Traffic Management Station of the Lingshui Transportation Bureau, said that the Lingshui transportation department began to crack down on illegal passenger tricycles at the beginning of this year and banned a total of 613 illegal passenger tricycles.
In the next step, the transportation department will apply to the county government and work with multiple departments to increase efforts to rectify illegal operating vehicles such as tricycles, motorcycles, and illegal vehicles in the county.
At 8 a.m. on August 11, a reporter from Qilu Evening News followed the &quot;Healthy China Tour&quot; free clinic service team to Hegou Village, Xihu Town, Donggang District.
The village is located in a remote area, about 24 kilometers away from the urban area. There are more than 200 households in the village. Due to economic, transportation and physical limitations, it is inconvenient for many middle-aged and elderly patients to go out to see a doctor.
The free clinic offers comprehensive services, including internal medicine, surgery, respiratory medicine, psychiatry, dermatology, and pediatrics.
Many villagers heard that experts from the free clinic were coming and were already waiting in the small square of the village.
The 67-year-old Aunt Xue suffers from congenital scoliosis. In recent years, she has been deeply troubled by &quot;asthma&quot;, so much so that she can&#39;t even walk uphill without being out of breath.
The doctor told Aunt Xue that it was unlikely that chronic bronchitis could be completely cured, and that the symptoms could be relieved by taking medication.
At the dermatologist consultation office, an old man in his 60s came for consultation with her grandson.
The old man&#39;s grandson is 11 years old this year. His left foot has been troubled by &quot;athlete&#39;s foot&quot; since he was 3 years old.
After checking, the doctor told the old man that this was not &quot;athlete&#39;s foot&quot; but seasonal eczema. Don&#39;t use medicine casually to delay treatment.
“In this village we provide medical treatment and B-ultrasound services, while another free medical service team in Qiujiadianzi Village, Hubu Township, Wulian County also provides free physical examination services.
This free medical clinic in the countryside is just one part of the &quot;Healthy China Tour&quot;. In the days to come, other activities will be carried out one after another. &quot;
51Talk Worry-free English is considered a milestone in building an online education industry ecosystem.
CEO Huang Jiajia said that bringing the world&#39;s best learning resources to Chinese children is their strategy for the next five years.
It is understood that “51Talk’s biggest advantage is that it can meet the different needs of users of different ages.
Chief Operating Officer Zhang Liming said that by connecting the world&#39;s high-quality foreign teachers&#39; resources and services to students, parents no longer have to travel and spend precious time picking up and dropping off their children.
The central bank renewed the payment business licenses of 27 non-bank institutions including Alipay for 5 years
In order to integrate business resources, leverage economies of scale, and improve regulatory efficiency, payment institutions that plan to merge the &quot;Payment Business License&quot; will be adjusted accordingly in this renewal period.
The merged payment institution shall complete the payment business undertaking within 6 months from the date of announcement.
The People&#39;s Bank of China will handle the cancellation and replacement of the relevant &quot;Payment Business License&quot; after the business undertaking is completed.
Because some payment institutions have serious business violations, business stagnation and shrinkage, or proactive applications to terminate business types, this renewal will reduce their business scope.
Relevant institutions should stop carrying out relevant payment businesses in an orderly manner as required within 6 months from the date of announcement.
The People&#39;s Bank of China will continue to carry out the renewal of the &quot;Payment Business License&quot; in accordance with the law and prudently.
Sustained earthquakes with magnitudes 4.4 and 4.5 in Tibet&#39;s Nyima County have caused no casualties yet
According to reports from the local civil affairs department, there have been no casualties so far, and the specific disaster situation is under further statistical verification.
Yu Bo, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Disabled Persons&#39; Federation, attended the event and delivered an important speech.
The leaders present jointly awarded the second batch of &quot;Love Yuanshan&quot; Lei Feng&#39;s private racing team.
Over the past 20 years, &quot;Love Yuanshan&quot; has written about the great love in the world with practical actions. Yuanshan Forest Farm has taken over and managed 5 institutions in difficulty, and directly resettled nearly a thousand employees.
In the face of every major disaster, Yuanshan people spontaneously organized donations of money and materials to extend a helping hand to the society.
Sun Jianbo, the National Moral Model Nomination Award and former Party Secretary of Shanshan Forestry Farm, said that Lei Feng’s spirit inherits the truth, goodness and beauty of the times and is a long-term cause that is in line with the socialist value system.
After the ceremony, participants visited the Shandong Yuanshan Hard Entrepreneurship Memorial Hall and experienced the construction of barrier-free facilities.
Rivas Mayor Wilfredo Lopez said at the teacher training site that various Nicaraguan government agencies are working together to promote environmental management plans and carry out tree planting activities with HKND Group.
As a canal project developer, HKND Group has always followed international best practices and built the canal in accordance with international standards to protect Nicaragua&#39;s ecological environment to the greatest extent. &quot;
Through a combination of theory and practice, college students led primary and secondary school students to plant trees together and educate the next generation of Nicaragua on how to green the environment.
Francisco Reyes, a professor at the Department of Natural Resources and Environment of the National Agricultural University of Nicaragua, led the team to participate in the afforestation education project.
We have reason to believe that the transoceanic Grand Canal project, also led by HKND Group, will bring more benefits to the Nicaraguan people and create more job opportunities for the locals. &quot;
In order to ensure the long-term effects of afforestation, HKND Group also produced an afforestation training brochure and distributed it to all 15,000 primary and secondary school students in Rivas Province, aiming to provide long-term technical guidance to teachers, students and parents.
Recently, the 10th China International Folk Art Festival, hosted by the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Qinghai Provincial Government, kicked off in Xining, Qinghai.
About 300 artists from art troupes from 13 countries and regions on five continents gathered together to bring wonderful performances with international and folk characteristics to the audience.
Tajikistan&#39;s &quot;Avesta&quot; news agency quoted the Tajik Central Bank on the 11th as saying that the inflation rate in Tajikistan in the first seven months of this year was 3.7%.
The report pointed out that the inflation rate in Tajikistan in the first seven months of this year was 3.7%, of which the inflation rate in July was 0.6%, while the inflation rate in the past year was 6%.
According to reports, the Tajik government&#39;s goal is to control the annual inflation rate at 7.5% in 2016, while the inflation rate in Tajikistan in 2015 was 5.1%.
In addition, the report also pointed out that regarding Tajikistan’s economic development and inflation in 2016, there are certain discrepancies between the forecasts of the Tajik government and some major international financial institutions.
According to the forecast of the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development of Tajikistan, Tajikistan&#39;s economic growth will reach 7% in 2016, and the country&#39;s inflation is basically above this level.
The Asian Development Bank, World Bank and International Monetary Fund have given different forecasts for Tajikistan’s economic development and inflation in 2016.
For these two indicators, the Asian Development Bank&#39;s forecast is 4.2% and 7%, the World Bank&#39;s forecast is 4.8% and 7.5%, and the International Monetary Fund&#39;s forecast is 3.4% and 8.2%.
It is reported that despite the impact of a series of unfavorable external factors such as the international economic downturn, the depreciation of the Russian ruble and the decrease in remittances, Tajikistan&#39;s economy still achieved a growth of 6% in 2015.
On August 11, when the reporter interviewed Huang Yilin by phone, who had returned to her home in Mianyang, Sichuan, she said: &quot;The situation was too urgent at that time, and the only thought in my mind was to save people!&quot;
Huang Yilin is a 2015 student at the School of Landscape Architecture, Central South University of Forestry and Science.
Huang Yilin, who majored in urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Langzhong, Sichuan and learn about local architectural design, so her family went on the trip.
Around 10 a.m. on August 8, Huang Yilin&#39;s father was resting in the hotel, and mother and daughter went out to visit Langzhong Ancient City.
After walking not far, I suddenly saw a group of people shouting, so I walked forward out of curiosity.
Seeing that &quot;the little boy had disappeared and the little girl was splashing desperately in the water, with only her little head exposed on the river and sinking from time to time,&quot; Huang Yilin, who had learned to swim as a child, hurriedly jumped in to save people.
After entering the water, Huang Yilin, who is 165 cm tall, found that she could not step on the bottom!
The water that looked calm before turned out to be a riptide underneath!
But she still swam to the little girl regardless.
Huang Yilin said that the river was turbid and fast, and it took almost all her strength to reach the distance of less than 5 meters.
She tried her best to push the little girl to the embankment. &quot;The slope is extremely slippery. I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t have enough strength and will sink.&quot;
So, Huang Yilin asked her mother for help. After hearing her daughter&#39;s cry for help, Ms. Yin, who was not good at water, prepared to go into the water to rescue, but was stopped by tourists nearby.
On August 10, after the news about Huang Yilin jumping into the river to save others spread, Ms. Yin received condolences and praises from many relatives and friends, and was also &quot;accounted&quot; by many relatives and friends.
&quot;Looking back now, I&#39;m really scared! To be honest, when the child couldn&#39;t hold on on the river embankment and asked me for help, my heart almost broke.&quot;
Ms. Yin said with lingering fear that although it was dangerous, if she was in such a scene again, she would still support her daughter&#39;s choice. She was proud of her daughter!
Because she was forced to swim, Huang Yilin rarely took the initiative to get into the water after learning to swim. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect that this skill would really come in handy.&quot;
According to Chen Yiyang, the monitor of Huang Yilin&#39;s class, Huang Yilin is recognized as the &quot;student master&quot; in the class and is willing to help others.
The opening ceremony of the first Youth Games of Yunnan Province on the 13th played the national card to show youthful vitality
The first Youth Games of Yunnan Province will be held in Mangshi, Dehong Prefecture from August 13th to August 22nd.
On August 12, in Mangshi, Dehong Prefecture, the organizing committee held a press conference to introduce the organization of the competition and preparations for the opening ceremony.
The first Youth Games of Yunnan Province are hosted by the Yunnan Provincial Sports Bureau and hosted by the Mangshi People&#39;s Government. The Games will hold an opening ceremony on the morning of the 13th.
The competition includes 11 events including track and field, football, basketball, tennis, volleyball, weightlifting, cycling, wrestling, gymnastics, and martial arts, involving 180 events.
Chang Lin, deputy director of the Organizing Committee of the First Youth Games of Yunnan Province and deputy director of the Provincial Sports Bureau, said that based on the principle of &quot;government-led, market-operated, and frugal hosting of the games&quot;, all preparatory work is currently in place.
Renovations have been completed on the weightlifting hall and martial arts hall of Dehong Prefecture Senior Sports Association, a small wrestling hall in Mangshi, and the mountain bike track in Yinta Scenic Area.
In terms of event security, the conference has currently recruited 580 volunteers. During the competition, these volunteers will provide enthusiastic services to athletes and spectators at various venues.
At the same time, 70 medical staff and 11 ambulances were mobilized from various hospitals in Dehong Prefecture to form 11 medical teams, responsible for medical security at the competition site and athletes&#39; accommodation.
When it comes to the opening and closing ceremonies, the lighting ceremony of this Youth Games combines the traditional sports characteristics of Yunnan ethnic minorities and will display the rich cultural connotation of Yunnan.
Currently, in preparation for the opening ceremony theatrical performance, a total of 1,500 student actors from Dehong Vocational College and more than 2,000 other professional actors have been mobilized.
The opening and closing ceremonies will fully integrate Yunnan elements and Dehong characteristics to showcase the regional culture and folk customs of Mangshi, Dehong Prefecture.
At present, the rehearsal for the opening ceremony has ended, and the official performance will be held tomorrow morning.
The artistic performance at the opening ceremony of this Youth Games was larger than in the past.
Starting from September 1, senior citizens aged 60 to 64 can ride urban buses at half price.
On the morning of the 11th, at the IC card sales center of Jining City Public Transport Company, several elderly people were queuing up to apply for cards in front of the card application window. 62-year-old Uncle Yao got the senior citizen half-price card.
Previously, the Jining Municipal Committee on Aging, the Municipal Finance Bureau, and the Municipal Transportation Bureau issued the &quot;Notice on half-price urban bus rides for seniors aged 60-64 years old.&quot; This preferential policy was officially implemented on September 1 this year.
&quot;Eligible seniors can just go to the IC sales center with their second-generation ID cards; seniors with out-of-town household registration who meet this age can also enjoy this discount.&quot;
Liu Xia, deputy director of the computer center of Jining Bus Company, said that more than 200 senior half-price cards have been issued since the application started on August 1.
Currently, there are two types of senior citizen cards, one is the senior citizen free card and the other is the senior citizen half-price card.
&quot;In order to facilitate the elderly, the system has been upgraded. The review of the elderly free card has been reduced from twice a year to once. Elderly people who hold the card do not need to make two trips.&quot;
According to the official Weibo of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission stated today that currently, the securities regulatory authorities of the two places, as well as the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, are working closely together.
At the same time, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has established a special working group for the &quot;Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect&quot; to actively promote various preparations for the &quot;Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect&quot;. Once the relevant regulatory rules and technical equipment are in place, it will be launched this year.
If a certain number of fraudulent text messages are sent in bulk, even if the fraud is not successful, the person can still be punished for fraud.
The Wolong District People&#39;s Court of Nanyang City, Henan Province found during the trial that from September 30 to October 4, 2015, the defendant Li Huiwang used pseudo base station equipment to send fraudulent messages in Tongbai County and Nanyang City.
In the same year, at around 10:00 on October 5, the defendant was caught by the public security police when he came to a hotel room in Wolong District, Nanyang City again and used a fake base station to send a group of fraudulent text messages.
After evaluation, the pseudo base station equipment sent 62,228 text messages on October 4, 2015, causing an average communication interruption of more than 8 seconds to less than 10 minutes for 62,228 mobile phone users.
After trial, the court held that the defendant Li Huiwang used fake base stations to send a total of 62,228 fraudulent text messages to an unspecified number of people, and his behavior constituted the crime of fraud.
Regarding the defender&#39;s suggestion that the defendant was an attempted offender when he was arrested, had no consequences, and had a good attitude of pleading guilty, it is recommended that the defendant be given a lighter punishment.
Taking into account the nature of the defendant&#39;s crime, attitude of guilty and other circumstances, he was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison for fraud and fined 10,000 yuan.
The Siberian tiger is currently listed as Endangered (EN) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, joint monitoring data from China, the United States, Russia and other countries in 1998 showed that there were only 4 to 6 wild Siberian tigers and 3 to 5 Siberian leopards in Jilin Province.
According to Yu Changchun, director of the Protection Division of the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, Jilin Province has continued to increase the protection of wild animals in recent years. The populations of Siberian tigers and Siberian leopards in China are growing significantly, and their distribution areas continue to expand.
The latest monitoring data in 2015 showed that 27 wild Siberian tigers and 42 Amur leopards were detected in Jilin Province alone.
As the world&#39;s flagship wildlife conservation species located in the border area between China and Russia, cooperation between China and Russia is of great significance to the recovery and reproduction of wild Siberian tiger and leopard populations.
According to the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, Jilin Province has previously established a long-term and stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the 2016 China Hunchun Tiger and Leopard Conservation International Forum that ended on the 11th, the forestry departments and animal protection organizations of China and Russia once again reached a number of consensuses.
The Jilin Provincial Forestry Department stated that strengthening cooperation in tiger and leopard protection between China and Russia is not only a very urgent task facing the protection of Siberian tigers and leopards in China, but also a top priority to maintain the health of the tiger and leopard populations in Russia.
As a party member and leading cadre, Sun Fujian has lost his ideals and beliefs and seriously violated the party&#39;s discipline. After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he still refused to restrain himself, refused to stop, and violated discipline despite being vile in nature and serious in nature.
After this case occurred, it became a focus case after being reported by many media, with extremely negative social impact.
After the case occurred, the leaders of the Criminal Police Detachment of the Haikou City Public Security Bureau attached great importance to it and immediately organized a large team of capable police officers from the detachment to take the initiative to carry out investigations.
The police immediately chased the suspect online, took various measures to control him, and contacted other local police to assist in investigating Wang&#39;s whereabouts.
Because the suspect is a habitual theft offender and has been attacked and dealt with by the public security organs many times, he has strong anti-reconnaissance capabilities. In addition, he has been taking drugs for a long time, and his drug addiction often occurs during interrogations, making the interrogation work very difficult.
The Greenland shark, also known as the small-headed sleeper shark, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic waters around Greenland and Iceland. It reaches a length of 4 to 5 meters when it reaches adulthood.
But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 centimeter per year, which suggests that Greenland sharks may have an exceptionally long lifespan.
Traditional dating methods usually use the calcified tissue of animals. In some sharks, fin ridges can be used, but this kind of calcified tissue is very rare in Greenland sharks.
The new study, led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turned to the lens of the Greenland shark&#39;s eye for radiocarbon dating.
This method has been used to determine the age of whales before, but this is the first time it has been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the lifespan of the largest shark was estimated to be 392 years, with a margin of error of 120 years.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and may be as old as 512 years old.
In addition, it is said that female Greenland sharks do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 4 meters in length, which means they do not reach adulthood until they are at least 156 years old.
The researchers therefore wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate known on earth, surpassing the previous longevity champion, the right whale (211 years old).
Over the past year, the exchange rate reform has achieved remarkable results, and the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable, which has also laid the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB.
Judging from market performance, over the past year, the RMB exchange rate has obvious two-way floating characteristics, the exchange rate flexibility has increased, and exchange rate expectations are generally stable.
Since the exchange rate reform, the central parity rate of RMB against the US dollar has frequently fluctuated over 100 points, but the process has alternated between rises and falls.
The last exchange reform measures before last year&#39;s &quot;8·11&quot; exchange reform were implemented in 2005. Over the past ten years, the RMB has appreciated significantly against the US dollar.
Since the implementation of the new exchange rate reform, the RMB has changed from its previous appreciation state, and the central parity rate of the RMB exchange rate has depreciated by approximately 8% in one year.
On October 1 this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the RMB as a weighted currency in the SDR (Special Drawing Rights).
This week, statistics released by the General Administration of Customs of China showed that in the first seven months of this year, China’s total import and export value was 13.21 trillion yuan, down 3% from the same period last year.
In July, China&#39;s total import and export value only fell by 0.9% year-on-year, and exports in particular increased by 2.9% year-on-year.
Relevant experts believe that although imports and exports show signs of stabilization in July, expectations should not be too high.
In July, China&#39;s total import and export value was 2.09 trillion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 0.9%.
Among them, exports were 1.22 trillion yuan, an increase of 2.9%; imports were 873 billion yuan, a decrease of 5.7%; the trade surplus was 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34%.
Although the total value of imports and exports still declined year-on-year, export data increased. This was also the fifth consecutive month of growth in exports since March this year.
Shanghai police arrested more than 3,400 thieves in four months and cracked down on 157 &quot;theft, robbery and fraud&quot; gangs
While solving the case, the police also recovered stolen money and stolen goods totaling more than RMB 33 million.
According to the confessions of the members of the theft gang, they entered Shanghai from other places by chartering a black car, and then got off the car separately to commit the crime. After a few hours, they met up and boarded the car, and then left Shanghai together.
During the crime process, criminal suspects often use a building as a unit, climbing on the outer wall and breaking off the anti-theft window fence to steal from top to bottom.
Recently, the suspect involved in the case has been transferred by the Xuhui Public Security Bureau to the Xuhui District Procuratorate for review and prosecution.
The police remind the general public to lock the doors and windows at home when going out. Regarding the choice of anti-theft windows, it is recommended that the public choose harder steel.
According to China Voice&#39;s &quot;News Evening Peak&quot; report, in late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the Sixth African Development Conference.
The African Development Conference is led by Japan. The previous five conferences were all held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan. Therefore, this conference will also be moved to Africa for the first time.
Officials from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that holding a local meeting in Africa would help draw the attention of African and European countries to Japan.
In order to cooperate with Shinzo Abe&#39;s visit, according to Kyodo News, Japan&#39;s Liberal Democratic Party will send parliamentary groups to relevant countries.
Japan&#39;s path to becoming a member of the United Nations Security Council began in the early 1990s, and the Conference on African Development initiated by Japan also began in 1993. This is no coincidence!
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations and is an important vote bank of the United Nations. If Japan wants to &quot;join the permanent membership&quot;, how can it abandon Africa?
They will also exchange views with relevant people from various countries on the extremist organization &quot;Islamic State&quot; and countermeasures against terrorist activities.
The &quot;Western Group&quot; will visit 7 countries including Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea-Bissau.
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida also recently stated his intentions for the African Development Conference at the United Nations Security Council.
Abe announced here that in order to stabilize the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, he will provide 100 billion yen (approximately RMB 6.1 billion) in assistance within five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan&#39;s generosity to Africa has always had two main purposes: one is to increase Japan&#39;s presence in Africa; the other is to win the support of African countries on the issue of permanent membership.
Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japanese issues, analyzed, &quot;Politically, although Africa is relatively lagging behind in development, it has a relatively large number of countries, so Japan has always regarded it as a so-called &#39;big ticket field.&#39;&quot;
Japan will not give up in the future, and its work in Africa will not stop here but will continue to be strengthened.
Economically, because Japan has relatively strong production capacity, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the current context of low birthrate and aging population, domestic demand is relatively sluggish.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi 10 years ago to Abe 10 years later, Japan has launched many &quot;sprints&quot; to join the permanent membership, but all failed.
Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japanese issues, believes that Japan’s intention to join the permanent membership is clear at a glance, but the road to joining the permanent membership is bound to be full of difficulties.
If Japan wants to achieve its goals, it must first have good relations with neighboring countries. Among them, Japan needs to have a correct attitude whether it is geopolitical competition, ethnic disputes or historical understanding.
Haikou Maritime Court filed a case in the early morning to ensure the rights and interests of the parties involved in the Lingao fishing boat sinking incident
Relatives of the three dead crew members rushed to the Haikou Maritime Court at 4 a.m. on August 7 to apply for property preservation and seizure of the suspected cargo ship before prosecution.
After the incident on the 4th, the cargo ship suspected of causing the accident was detained by the Maritime Safety Administration at Xiuying Port in Haikou to assist in the investigation.
In view of the fact that the 72-hour detention period of the Maritime Safety Administration expired at 9 a.m. on August 7, the relatives of the victims filed an application for property preservation with the court in the early morning of the 7th.
At 4:20 in the morning, the applicant filed for pre-indictment property preservation, and the bailiff on duty patiently received him.
This lecture was hosted by Professor Cao Xianqiang, Executive Vice Dean of the School of Politics and Public Administration of Shandong University.

Not only does it introduce Bon culture and history in the form of comics, but it also has a Bon-themed 3D selfie area, a traditional snack area, and a mobile classroom for traditional crafts, attracting many children and overseas people to experience and visit.
A couple from France stayed at the event for nearly three hours and had an experience in the mini flower card mobile classroom.
&quot;I found this special festival online, so I decided to come and see it. It felt very fresh.&quot;
They said that although France also has similar festivals to commemorate ancestors, the atmosphere is very heavy. Unlike here, there is music, food and you can learn traditional crafts.
She said, &quot;In a busy financial metropolis like Hong Kong, we can still see such a large-scale and organized ceremony to worship our ancestors.&quot;
&quot;This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional crafts and pass them on.&quot;
Hu Yansong, the president of this event, said, “We don’t want to make the Bon Cultural Festival very scary and make people afraid to approach it, especially children.”
&quot;We hope that through the youth-oriented activities and decorations on site, young people will know that what behind the Bon Festival culture is filial piety and gratitude.&quot;
He also said that a total of 24 teams participated in the &quot;Orphan Robbing Competition&quot; this time, including not only community organizations, but also cooperation with some schools to allow students to participate.
It is understood that the Hong Kong Chaozhou Bon Festival was included in the &quot;National Intangible Cultural Heritage List&quot; in 2011.
On the evening of the 11th, the National Peking Opera Company of China traveled thousands of miles to Mexico City with its famous drama &quot;The Legend of White Snake&quot; and presented an authentic Peking Opera feast to the local people at the National Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico.
As a key performance project of the &quot;China-Latin America Cultural Exchange Year&quot;, from August 9th to 23rd, the National Peking Opera Company of China performed 7 Peking Opera performances in five cities including Mexico City, the capital of Mexico, and Cordoba and Juarez.
The audience followed the plot of &quot;The Legend of White Snake&quot; and the actors&#39; singing and dancing, sometimes smiling knowingly and sometimes applauding enthusiastically.
Marissa Jimenez Cacho, who had attended a Peking Opera performance 15 years ago, accompanied her daughter to the end of the performance.
&quot;This is a wonderful performance. The music, lighting, and stage performances all impressed me deeply... I think it is necessary for my daughter to learn about Chinese culture and the art of Chinese Peking Opera.&quot;
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience left a deep impression on the young actor Fu Jia who plays the role of White Snake.
&quot;I didn&#39;t expect the Mexican audience to be so enthusiastic. Originally I was a little worried about whether they could understand the story, but today I saw that they were able to grasp the plot and many laughs, which was beyond my expectation.&quot;
Qiu Xiaoqi, Chinese Ambassador to Mexico, said that various cultural exchange activities during this year&#39;s &quot;China-Latin America Cultural Exchange Year&quot; will play a positive role in deepening understanding and enhancing friendship between the people of China and Mexico.
Next year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mexico, and more cultural exchange activities will be held in China and Mexico.
Liu Cigui went to Sanya to investigate &quot;double repairs and dual cities&quot; and required improving the level of urban construction and management
On the morning of the 12th, Liu Cigui presided over a symposium and listened to the report on the progress of Sanya City&#39;s &quot;dual repairs&quot; and &quot;double cities&quot; pilot work as well as the opinions and suggestions of various relevant departments.
Liu Cigui fully affirmed the phased results achieved and the good experiences and practices created during the pilot work.
Liu Cigui emphasized that Sanya should seize the historical development opportunity, take the &quot;double repair&quot; and &quot;double city&quot; pilot work as an important starting point, and give full play to the leading role of demonstration in the province&#39;s economic and social development.
It is necessary to play a leading role in improving the internationalization level of international tourist islands, starting from every detail, enriching international elements and creating international quality products.
It is necessary to play a leading role in urban-rural integration and all-region tourism, accelerate the construction of characteristic towns, integrate tourism elements into every project, and build every village and town in Sanya into a tourist attraction.
It is necessary to play a leading role in the &quot;100-day Action to Serve Social Investment&quot;, promote the construction of a number of major projects and parks, ensure the implementation of high-quality projects, and implement various requirements of the action.
Zhang Qi, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Sanya Municipal Party Committee, Wang Lu, Vice Governor, and Lu Zhiyuan, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, participated in the research discussion.
In her 14-year sports career, Deng Yaping won a total of 18 world championships and became the first person in Chinese Olympic history to win four Olympic gold medals.
She has been ranked No. 1 in the world for eight consecutive years and is the female athlete who has been ranked No. 1 in the world for the longest time in the history of table tennis.
On September 26, 2010, he served as deputy secretary-general of People&#39;s Daily and general manager of People&#39;s Search Network Co., Ltd., a department-level cadre.
Recently, she will join forces with Yu Minhong to build the first sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform in China.
There is also such a group of star coaches in the Chinese sports world: they were extremely successful in the era of athletes and won countless honors for the country; after retirement, they passed on what they have learned over the years to those who came after them, and trained them to win championships.
As the first world champion in Chinese men&#39;s gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to take up the coaching staff after retiring.
From the women&#39;s team coach to the men&#39;s team coach and then to the head coach, Huang Yubin created an &quot;Olympic gold team&quot; and led the team to achieve a mythical record of 9 gold medals, 1 silver medal and 4 bronze medals in the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Tian Liang has continued to appear in advertising endorsements, and has played important roles such as &quot;Cowherd&quot; and &quot;Lei Feng&quot; in recent years.
Many NBA players have proven their ability. But some people progress while others decline.
Whether it is due to increasing age or limited playing time, some players&#39; performance will decline every season.
Of course, some &quot;regression&quot; may just be a shrinking of data, and the strength of these players may not have declined.
Even though Wade is still one of the best shooting guards in the league, his performance in the Bulls should not be as good as that in the Heat.
The backcourt formed by him and Rondo has limited shooting range, and star Butler&#39;s three-point shooting percentage is only 32.8%, which makes their offense next season very crowded.
Coming to the Windy City, the Flash is bound to give more of the ball to Butler and Rondo, and he is likely to choose a healthy style of play in the regular season.
Okafor&#39;s situation is rather embarrassing. As the 76ers&#39; first choice last season, he has to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball rights in the new season.
This competition may not come quickly. Simmons still needs to adapt to the NBA game, and Embiid also needs to fully recover from his injuries as soon as possible. But whether Okafor can have a place in the 76ers&#39; long-man lineup is still a question. question.
Last season, 32% of Okafor&#39;s points came from low-post offense, which was higher than Cousins, Vucevic and Brook Lopez. At the same time, his usage rate was also among the top 40 in the league.
With Simmons already showing excellent potential as a point forward and Embiid also having a body that is more suitable for NBA games, Okafor&#39;s status may not be so stable anymore.
In the past two seasons, Thompson&#39;s usage rate has been stable in the top 20 in the league, and these are also the two best seasons of his career.
But the problem is that with the arrival of Durant, Thompson&#39;s usage rate will definitely drop, which will inevitably affect his performance.
This impact will not only be the number of shots taken, Tang Shen&#39;s ball-handling offense will definitely be greatly reduced next season, which in some aspects will also make it easier for opponents to defend him.
Durant&#39;s arrival will definitely shrink the data of the Warriors players, but the one who has shrunk the most is probably Thompson.
But this does not mean that Tang Shen&#39;s level has declined, it is more like he has made sacrifices for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better last season than the data reflected, not only because his efficiency at the basket reached a career high, but his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the GDP combination finally came to an end. As the youngest of the three, there was not much oil left in the French sports car&#39;s fuel tank.
After winning the third championship ring, only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular season MVPs than James, and Jordan was the only person with more FMVPs than James.
Oh, by the way, James just brought Cleveland its first professional sports championship trophy in the past 52 years.
James, who is entering the 14th season of his career, needs to better ensure his physical strength and prepare for the playoffs.
Therefore, in the regular season, James&#39; data is likely to decline further, and he will assign more burdens to Irving, but he will still easily become the top three players in the league.
&quot;We must carry forward the talents we learned at home in Russia.&quot;
On the 12th local time, Huang Jing, chairman of the Moscow Overseas Chinese Federation, said excitedly when seeing a reporter from China News Service.
Not long ago, she participated in the &quot;Chinese Talents (Calligraphy, Painting) Training Course for Overseas Chinese Cultural Societies&quot; sponsored by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council of China and hosted by Jinan University.
When I first participated in the training class, I had no idea where to start with calligraphy and painting. As a result, after the training class, I was able to draw and write my own works.
After returning to Moscow, I must use the knowledge and skills I have learned to make my own contribution to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture.
Na Yanwei, Secretary General of the Russian Association for the Promotion of Chinese Culture, who also participated in this training course, also felt the same way.
She said that she has made great progress with the help of the teachers in the training class, and she also feels the important responsibility as an &quot;overseas disseminator of Chinese culture.&quot;
Na Yanwei said that after returning to Russia, he will spread and promote traditional Chinese culture among Chinese and Russians who love Chinese culture.

GB silver in rugby sevens, Fiji gold
Great Britain failed to continue their impressive form in front of Fiji in Thursday night&#39;s Rugby Sevens final, being beaten 43-7 at Rio&#39;s Teodoro Stadium.
Fiji&#39;s impeccable performance in ball control, tackling, avoidance, coordination, running and strength won the gold medal, the country&#39;s first-ever Olympic medal.
The silver medal was also a big consolation for the defeated British team. This silver medal was the third silver medal won by the British delegation that day. It was a feat that would make England rugby proud: they had beaten New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on their way to their first ever Olympic sevens.
Earlier in the day, the British team narrowly defeated South Africa 7-5, which may have affected their status in the final.
But in any case, the current Fiji team is enough to defeat a spirited 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Briton will wear a gold medal, which may or may not be a consolation to Team GB. This Englishman is Ben Ryan, the head coach of the Fiji team from Wimbledon, who once served as the head coach of the British team.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today&#39;s results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they were winless at the Adelaide Sevens.
Now, they are just one step away from the championship.
Although they suffered a huge blow, they also made amazing progress.
Fiji took advantage from the start, leaving the British team defenseless.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like hitting a series of moving buses. The World Series champions were already up 5-0 when Ossie Coriniso drove into the corner flag.
Just four minutes into the game, Jerry Tuwai scored another touchdown on the right wing.
At 12-0, England barely touched the ball.
Mitchell&#39;s strong block prevented the giant Leon Nakalawa from scoring a third time, but this only slowed down Fiji&#39;s scoring.
At 7 minutes, Asa Welemalu touched down in the right corner. 17-0, the British team worsened.
Nakarava scored another point with one minute left in the first half of the game.
Watmo Lavovo then burst through the UK defense and headed straight to the score line.
At halftime, the score was 29-0.
It&#39;s as if the Fijians were born to play seven-a-side rugby, while the British team is still in its infancy.
This is the case.
Great Britain made a huge change in the second half and pounded the Fijian defense for a full four minutes, which was as good as it gets for a first half. But then the Fiji team played a wonderful combination, and Joshua Tuesova scored again.
Dan Norton created a scoring opportunity for the British team. He touched down in the left corner to change the score to 36-7, but the game was already in the control of the South Sea island nation. Their fans sang loudly, waved flags, and Singing and dancing.
The Fiji team&#39;s wonderful performance makes people have to applaud.
Mata Willian stopped an indifferent Fijian attack in the final seconds.
When the final whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged each other, and the completely defeated British team could only retire with regret.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while the British pair narrowly defeated South Africa in a tight semi-final showdown.
Kyle Brown gave South Africa the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with some good footwork.
Later, Marcus Watson, brother of England&#39;s Anthony, secured the team&#39;s victory with a wonderful interception, and the British team finally won the silver medal.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning inspired by cancer-stricken coach to win rowing gold
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most touching gold medal.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning have trained 220 punishing lifts since their first paddle, and the gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa has even more extraordinary significance.
Although they were the only two oarsmen, the voice of another person on board - coach Robin Williams - accompanied them throughout their bid for a second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women&#39;s double sculls, the first British pair to achieve this feat. Highly successful women&#39;s rowing team.
They have maintained an unbeaten record of 39 games and have an absolute advantage.
What we see is these two talented athletes moving gracefully across the water, but that&#39;s not all there is to this victory.
Behind every rowing gold medal are many people who volunteer to help, and it is their continuous dedication that makes the difference, and the one who helps the most is a man who learned he had cancer 30 months ago and didn’t know he could Did the coach live to see this day.
As he said, death can come at any time.
I had bladder cancer and they operated on me.
Without surgery, cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
The situation would be much worse.
This will slightly change your perspective.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014, which minimized the effects, although that may not be appropriate to say in this situation.
I needed to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
This is an inspiration to me.
I live in a hospital, and even though they say a few steps is enough, I walk 20, 30, 50 feet at a time around the room.
This is where it all started.
Rowing itself is a journey and this makes that journey a little longer.
At the moment of winning the gold medal, their first thought was of Williams. Williams was a little more chatty than usual this morning, an effort to combat his anxiety.
Stanning, a former captain of the Royal Artillery who will later go to Afghanistan, said: &quot;I&#39;m in a bad mood this week, maybe a bit extreme, but this gold medal is really special.&quot;
It told me repeatedly how much this meant to me and how much hard work it took me, Helen and Robin.
This is the reward for three years of hard work by Helen, Robin and me.
Without Robin we would be nobody and a big thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better trainer and coach.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning are undefeated in five years.
The pair set up a level of punishment that their opponents could not match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Graf still had a lot of physical reserves.
It was thrilling at the time.
Helen shouted: &quot;Keep the pace, keep the pace&quot;.
It is indeed very important not to be influenced by your opponents.
We had a great start, and we weren&#39;t expecting anything earth-shattering.
We didn&#39;t think about the glory of the day, we just thought about rowing every stroke and winning the race, and we did that.
The pair took a year to decide their future.
Graf will marry TV adventurer Steve Backshall next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don&#39;t want to say this is my last game.
This would put too much pressure on me.
It took me about six months in London to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very nervous.
About 4 minutes have passed now.
&quot;I feel better,&quot; she said.

The average annual rate of inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index) over the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was - 0.8%.
Compared with June 2016, the consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0%, which means the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
The year-to-date inflation rate (July 2016 relative to December 2015) is -0.2%. Compared with July 2015, the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2%.

Snapchat&#39;s &#39;anime&#39; effect accused of mocking Asians
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers thought it had racial undertones.
Snapchat’s 150 million daily users can use its filter tool to alter reality and turn portraits into comical moments.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
These lenses have the effect of blunting and bending features, resulting in more than 30 million retouched selfies taken every day.
Any missteps are immediately noticed by the public.
The Snapchat Lens has been criticized in the past, with the app being accused of promoting black personas or white-skinned beauty.
So when the app this week gave some users a filter that created slanted eyes, weird teeth and a pink face, some critics called it a racial caricature of &quot;yellow&quot; Asians.
They even wonder whether these recurring issues mean the company has a larger problem with diversity.
Reports from The Verge and Motherboard sparked outrage on Wednesday after Snapchat said it was removing the feature.
The company explained that the filter was a tribute to the anime character, not a satire of Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of hurtful stereotypes in reality.
Others are also staunchly opposed to the cartoon characters.
A Korean-American art student who tweeted about the photos, which were widely shared, said in an email that the filters were &quot;disturbing and uncomfortable to say the least.&quot;
She added: &quot;It&#39;s hard to differentiate between the extremely disgusting caricature of Asia and the effect of the filter.&quot;
Although it’s not just yellow people in the filter, yellow people are extremely devalued.
Snapchat isn&#39;t the only company touching these cultural lines.
From corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we carry, American culture seems to be constantly promoting diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat’s large young population, which is more racially diverse than older generations, may be sensitive.
When a Snapchat filter creates an image that insults users, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday: &quot;It&#39;s harder for things like this to escape people&#39;s attention than it used to be.&quot;
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believed the racial controversy reflected a lack of racial diversity in Snapchat&#39;s hiring process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company for having a majority white workforce and an all-male leadership and ended her post with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese American, said: “Either they don’t have people of color on their staff to make decisions like this, or they have some people of color on their staff but they’re not in a position where they can speak out.”
Other observers shared her complaints about not being responded to by Snapchat.
The company does not release data on employee diversity and says it is a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its employees, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups and drive internal inclusion efforts.
Ms. Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: &quot;I wonder if they need more users like us who are against this behavior.&quot;
Congressional panel says military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
Officials at U.S. Central Command changed intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than what actually happened, a congressional panel said in a report released Thursday.
The interim report comes from a task force formed by the Republican chairs of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the House Appropriations Committee’s defense subcommittee. The report said there was &quot;widespread dissatisfaction&quot; among Central Command intelligence analysts who said superiors were tampering with their assessments of the U.S. war against the Islamic State.
Central Command (Centcom), located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news release about the report, &quot;Intelligence reviewed by Central Command&#39;s senior leaders paints a more optimistic picture of U.S. counterterrorism operations than is actually the case and is consistently more optimistic than analyzes by other intelligence agencies.&quot;
&quot;CENTCOM&#39;s actions are unacceptable. Our warfighters are suffering the consequences of war while high-level policymakers receive faulty analysis,&quot; said a Republican representative from California.
Central Command&#39;s leadership problems extend to the highest levels of the agency.
The report details longstanding problems in Central Command&#39;s description and analysis of U.S. training of Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered changes to the reports, the reports describe analysts who felt they were under pressure from Central Command leaders to target the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL). threat to express a more optimistic view.
&quot;During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than the actual situation,&quot; the report said.
For example, a Central Command official publicly stated that a major military operation to retake Mosul may be launched as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq&#39;s second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
&quot;After months of investigation, this outcome is clear,&quot; Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most senior intelligence officials at U.S. Central Command manipulated the command’s intelligence products to conceal the threat from the Islamic State in Iraq.
Republicans established a task force after learning from analysts that intelligence on the Islamic State had been manipulated.
Following this report released Thursday, more discoveries will be made as the investigation continues.
The Defense Department&#39;s inspector general also has a long-running investigation into Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released its findings on Thursday, echoing some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
&quot;Between 2014 and 2015, Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of the Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeepers,&quot; Representative Schiff, the committee&#39;s top Democrat, said in a statement. &quot;
Mr. Schiff said the process &quot;impeded the release of intelligence,&quot; lowered analyst morale and &quot;failed to accept dissent.&quot;
But Mr. Schiff and Democrats also said they found no evidence that the White House sought to pressure Central Command analysts to make their conclusions fit &quot;presets or political narratives.&quot;
The Daily Beast reported the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon inspector general began an investigation after receiving complaints from Central Command analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Navy Maj. Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report until the inspector general&#39;s investigation is concluded.
But he said: &quot;Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security topics.&quot;
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria has been successful, as a growing number of Defense Department officials claim.
But last year, the claims raised public questions about the extent to which President Obama could trust Central Command&#39;s assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis zones.
Criticisms about ISIS intelligence are reminiscent of a controversy more than a decade ago, when Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article arguing that George W. Bush&#39;s administration ignored the objections of numerous analysts , insisted on sending small forces to Iraq and paid little regard to the aftermath of the 2003 invasion.
Mr Hook played a key role in the intelligence push against the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hook&#39;s team concluded that airstrikes targeting Islamic State refineries did not significantly cut into the terror group&#39;s financial revenue because the group built makeshift refineries and continued to sell oil on the black market. This is contrary to the published statement.
According to a report in Time in September, Central Command did not announce the discovery to the public.
Central Command Commander Lloyd Austin III came under fire last year after lawyers reviewed Senate testimony that offered an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and is currently being replaced at Central Command by Joseph Votel.
U.S. wins fourth straight in women&#39;s hockey, heads to showdown with Great Britain
Katie Bam, who scored three times in a 6-1 win over Japan, scored twice for the U.S. women&#39;s hockey team on Thursday, helping the U.S. beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games is amazing, but the 27-year-old Bam said she didn&#39;t know she had such an outstanding performance.
&quot;I didn&#39;t know anything about it,&quot; she said.
I&#39;m not someone who remembers how many goals I&#39;ve scored.
All she knows is that the U.S. has won four straight at the Olympics and will compete for first place in the group with Britain, which is undefeated after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States meet in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams advance to the quarter-finals, a match that will determine who emerges top of the group.
The team that tops the group will avoid encountering the strong Dutch team and can go further. The Dutch team qualified first in the other group.
In Saturday&#39;s game, the United States performed wonders with a stunning performance. You know, at the London Olympics four years ago, the U.S. team finished last among 12 teams.
Bam was also on that team.
Bam grew up in Bluebell, Pa., first picking up a hockey stick at age 3 (her twin sister played the sport at Drexel) and joining the national team at age 16, becoming the most successful player to date. The youngest member of the national team.
She missed the 2008 Olympics after failing to make the final roster.
In 2012, she and her teammates were underdogs.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham took over as head coach and things began to change.
“This is a culture, mindset and substantive change,” Bam said.
We were not where we were now in London at that time.
We had a complete turnaround.
Bam opened the scoring in the first half Thursday night with a backhand shot from close range.
India were still winless in this tournament, but the team showed amazing tenacity and held on to a 1-0 lead towards the end of the third quarter, when Bam exploded.
She dribbled the ball down the left side of the court, then cut inside to the center and volleyed into the net, giving the United States a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal midway through the fourth quarter.
American goalkeeper Jackie Bridges kept a clean sheet for the first time in this tournament, having allowed one goal in each of the first three wins.
This time she went above and beyond.
So does Bam.
&quot;We&#39;re in good shape right now,&quot; Parnham said. But just how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday&#39;s game.
Shabby Depression-era Food in &quot;A Big Feast&quot;
In March 1933, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office enjoying lunch.
A gourmet, President Roosevelt favored Fifth Avenue delicacies such as foie gras and Maryland waterfish stew.
His menu that day was simple: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and fruit pudding for dessert.
&quot;It&#39;s about sharing food through thick and thin with people who are suffering,&quot; said Jean Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: &quot;It also speaks to the way Americans eat.&quot;
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are both food historians.
Mr. Coe&#39;s last book, &quot;Chowder,&quot; was about Chinese food in America, and Ms. Ziegelman&#39;s &quot;97 Orchards&quot; tells the story of the lives of ghetto tenants through food.
Their new book, &quot;A Big Feast,&quot; to be published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of food in America during the Great Depression.
After sharing some food insights, they met a reporter at Eisenberg&#39;s sandwich shop. This simple lunch counter in the Flatiron District has been open since the crash of 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, ordered the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable platter.
The reporter ordered a meatloaf, which the couple thought would be appropriate for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
“Bread was very popular at the time,” Ms. Ziegelman said.
There were peanut bread, liver bread, and soybean bread.
They&#39;re all made with one ingredient and an inexpensive topping that can be poured over the ingredient.
Imagine your dinner is filled with peanuts.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
&quot;They must be like lead in your stomach,&quot; he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, every meal in America was a buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooked for the male farm workers, and there were freshly made pies for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
During World War I, it was Americans who brought food to hungry Europeans. &quot;A Big Feast&quot; chronicles how the country suddenly ceased to be a place of plenty.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wrote the book: &quot;At a time when food had become a major source of discomfort for Americans.&quot;
Another unpleasant topic is shabby new foods: &quot;mystery foods&quot; such as breads and stews have become main courses, and stews are &quot;the best way to cook leftovers,&quot; Ms. Ziegelman said, because chefs You can use the cream in the sauce to mask unpalatable ingredients.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has starred on American dinner tables for years, has become a rare luxury.
A strange smorgasbord that only considers calories and puts nutrition first before taste or even basic cooking common sense.
While researching the book, which includes various recipes, Ms. Ziegelman created a grilled onion stuffed with peanut oil.
&quot;It&#39;s not something you see often at the dinner table,&quot; Mr. Coe said.
&quot;It&#39;s so weird,&quot; Ms. Ziegelman said.
Peanut oil doesn&#39;t mix well with grilled onions at all.
This is a feature of many family budget meals.
Uniquely in history, home economists such as Louis Stanley, head chef of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943, influenced the country&#39;s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to be &quot;budget-savvy&quot; and brave enough to turn terrible meals like creamy pasta with carrots into gourmet meals.
&quot;A Hearty Feast&quot; is a sumptuous &quot;historic treasure&quot;.
Particularly interesting are the government&#39;s responses to hungry people, such as President Herbert Hoover&#39;s &quot;I can&#39;t do other people&#39;s business&quot; attitude.
While he openly extols the simple Iowa farmhouse of his childhood, he eats like a millionaire.
Mr. Coe said: &quot;He likes to eat European-style Western food, such as fish with cucumber sauce.&quot;
He wore an evening gown and dined in a gilded dining room.
He is clearly out of touch with the people.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, hadn&#39;t encouraged him to set an example with his diet.
As the book notes, Ms. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, so the food in the White House was “not only the nastiest food in Washington, but also the worst-cooked.”
Once America got back on track, many of the Depression-era cooking styles were abandoned.
What remains, Ms. Ziegelman said, is our focus on calories and nutrition and applying science to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they learned more about Ms. Ziegelman&#39;s mother&#39;s eating habits, such as how she didn&#39;t throw food away.
&quot;She was very afraid of wasting food,&quot; Mr Coe said.
“She actually made a lot of people sick,” Ms. Ziegelman recalled.
For example, there was a &quot;cream puff&quot; incident.
After removing the plates, she and Mr. Coe brought out a dessert they had prepared at home: the preserves pudding that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
&quot;It&#39;s called candied fruit,&quot; Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that giving a trendy name to a common dish was &quot;a common trick.&quot;
There is no whipped cream in this dessert, just preserved fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped their spoons into the thick brown paste.
Surprisingly, this dessert tastes pretty good.
Mr. Coe took a second and third spoonful.
He thought it was an acceptable and affordable dessert, so he told his wife: &quot;It would taste better with some chopped walnuts.&quot;
Unfortunately, OPEC&#39;s latest monthly report showed that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi Arabia&#39;s production reached a new high.
This report cannot help but cast doubt on the credibility of OPEC in the market. The road to oil price recovery may still be full of thorns.
On Monday, OPEC Rotating Chairman and Qatar Energy Minister Saada said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum from September 26 to 28.
OPEC&#39;s monthly report released on Wednesday showed that the output of the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, rose by 46,000 barrels per day in July to 33.11 million barrels per day.
OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil products, thereby exacerbating the market&#39;s oversupply.
Affected by this news, coupled with the U.S. raising its crude oil production forecast and an unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, international oil prices closed down for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday&#39;s close, the price of light crude oil futures for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 2.48%, and the price of London Brent crude oil futures for October delivery fell by 2.07%.
Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration also suppressed market sentiment.
Iran&#39;s official news agency Fars quoted Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh as saying on Wednesday that Iran&#39;s daily crude oil production peaked at 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
As soon as the news of the meeting came out, Russian Energy Minister Novak said that there was no need for a new round of production freeze negotiations under the current oil prices.
The last time oil-producing countries met was in April, OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measures.
Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said the market and media may be overreacting to the upcoming OPEC meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC changes market sentiment by sending signals that they will broker an agreement.
This method is like smoke and mirrors to distract people&#39;s attention (deliberately giving a wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank, said people think the possibility of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through its September meeting is low.
This is likely to further undermine the market&#39;s confidence in OPEC. After all, this organization has staged a &quot;crying wolf&quot; event.
All localities should focus on random inspections of medical institutions that publish medical advertisements in violation of regulations, have concentrated complaints and reports, and have been punished many times in the past.
The National Health and Family Planning Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will organize and supervise the implementation of special supervision and inspection work in some provinces in due course.
According to media disclosures, due to the previous large-scale influx of capital into Internet medicine, the current problem of product homogeneity is serious, the investment boom has gradually subsided, and capital has entered a wait-and-see period.
According to data from the Hong Kong Alibaba Hospital Management Research Center, a large number of Internet medical companies have died within one year of their establishment, and about 20% of start-up Internet medical companies have ceased to exist.
However, while most Internet medical companies are struggling to obtain Series A or Series B financing, there are several leading companies in the field that are still able to receive capital support.
It seems that Internet medical entrepreneurship must not be a &quot;swarm of bees&quot;, but must accurately identify the market demand and be dedicated and dedicated.
Yuyue invested 12 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, and Jiuzhoutong Equipment Company invested 18 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the country&#39;s policy support in medical informatization, electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
This cooperation between Yuyue and Jiuzhoutong is aimed at market demand, helping hospitals build advanced supply chain management systems, and taking this opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies that are greedy for everything, iBaby has focused on the vertical field of Internet obstetrics from the beginning, deeply cultivating both pregnant mothers and doctors.
Pregnant mothers can not only receive free 24-hour and one-to-one consultation with competent doctors, but also pay for targeted medical consultation.
On the doctor side, iBaby breaks geographical restrictions by organizing experts to conduct micro-lectures such as online lectures, peer exchanges, and case discussions for grassroots doctors.
Currently, there are three sections on the doctor&#39;s side, namely doctor continuing education, doctor social interaction and doctor help-seeking.
Provide services including online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges; social platforms between doctors in the same hospital and departments; legal aid, entrepreneurship support and other services needed for doctor-patient relationships or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently stated that Alibaba Health is “willing to work hard” to acquire health big data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism and cannot achieve uniformity in writing methods on the same entry.
Alibaba&#39;s current layout in the medical and health field is divided into three areas, namely Alibaba Health, Tmall Medical Center and Alipay Future Hospital.
Wang Lei admitted that starting a business in medical and health care will be more difficult than in other industries. &quot;It&#39;s not just about how much money you have, but also about being calm and able to endure loneliness and do it slowly.&quot;
Staying up late to watch Olympic games can easily damage your heart
The Brazilian Olympic Games are in full swing, and even though it is midnight in China when the games are broadcast, many citizens will stay up late to watch.
In this regard, doctors specifically remind you that staying up late to watch games has health risks and may cause cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late for a long time, this hormone will still be secreted in large amounts, and the human body will continue to be in a state of tension and excitement, unable to recover normally, which can easily cause vasoconstriction, increase blood pressure, and thus cause cardiovascular disease.
Han Zhiyuan specifically reminded that people with cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, family history, etc., will be more likely to develop cardiovascular disease if they stay up late.
If you stay up late for a long time, not only your cardiovascular function will be affected, but your gastrointestinal function, immune system, and neuroendocrine system will also be affected, and your risk of cancer will even increase.
For elderly friends, Han Zhiyuan suggested that they try not to stay up late to watch Olympic games, especially those with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last &quot;World Cup&quot; football match, Han Zhiyuan received a patient in his 60s. The cause of his myocardial infarction may be related to staying up late to watch the game.
Han Zhiyuan said that since this year, his department has treated some patients with myocardial infarction or stroke around the age of 25. This is largely caused by the patient&#39;s long-term lifestyle of staying up late.
1. Don’t stay up late every day. Occasionally stay up late to watch your favorite sports. For other sports, you might as well wait until the next day to watch the replay of the event.
2. When staying up late, replenish water in a timely manner and eat more fruits to prevent blood vessel blockage and enhance the body&#39;s immunity.
Beijing time on August 12th, after the women&#39;s 50-meter rifle three-position final at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Chinese veteran Du Li won the bronze medal.
Du Li became a veteran of four Olympic dynasties and won a total of 2 gold medals, 1 silver medal and 1 bronze medal in 4 Olympic Games.

The film is expected to premiere on CCTV and LeTV early next year, and will also launch a VR panoramic documentary version for the first time.
The documentary &quot;Polar&quot; is a large-scale work focusing on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the third pole of the earth. It tells the story of the integration of Tibetan tradition and modernity and the interaction between Tibet and the world from a new perspective.
The biggest advantage of VR works is that it gives the audience a unique sense of &quot;immersion&quot; in watching movies, which also puts higher requirements on the shooting process.
The filming team of the &quot;Polar&quot; Panoramic VR Special Edition stated that they want to ensure that the images in every direction are impeccable and give the audience an immersive feeling.
On August 11, the Yantai Detachment of the Shandong Armed Police Corps organized special operations snipers to brave the high temperature of 34 degrees Celsius to Kunyu Mountain to conduct jungle training.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union transported missiles into Cuba, which almost led to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
This incident is regarded as the peak of the Cold War and is known as the &quot;Cuban Missile Crisis&quot; in history.
But what is less known is that also during the Cold War, a strong solar storm almost caused the United States to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union. This event was not announced to the public for the first time until August 9 by researchers.
On May 23, 1967, a severe solar storm caused severe interference to the U.S. military&#39;s radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars were part of the U.S. ballistic missile warning system and were used to monitor Soviet missiles.
This paper, written by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activity at the time, and reviewed unclassified literature.
The paper writes that in the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching a nuclear war, the U.S. Air Force always had some fighter planes carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
The U.S. military commander did not know that the culprit of this interference was the solar storm and not the Soviet Union, so he ordered the fighter planes to enter combat readiness.
Fortunately, the U.S. military&#39;s research on solar activity and its electromagnetic interference with the earth, which began in the late 1950s, finally prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he compiled a detailed report based on information provided by the U.S. Air Force Aviation Weather Service.
As a direct consequence of this solar storm, the U.S. military has since regarded space weather as an operational concern and established a more powerful space weather forecasting system.
During daily travel, citizens find that their cars are blocked by strange vehicles. If they cannot contact the driver of the strange vehicle, they can use the &quot;WeChat Move Car&quot; function to solve this problem.
Starting from August 11, the Xi&#39;an Traffic Police WeChat service account &quot;Xi&#39;an Traffic Police&quot; launched the &quot;WeChat Car Moving&quot; service.
After the launch of this service, in daily life, if citizens encounter strange vehicles that hinder the movement of their vehicles without the driver being present, they can use the &quot;WeChat Move Car&quot; function to solve such problems.
The first function of this new service is to be fast and save administrative costs; the second function is to respect and protect the personal privacy of citizens; the third function is to provide all-weather and all-time service.
As long as citizens have WeChat, they can operate it on their own very conveniently. This method can relatively enable both parties to move the car to &quot;meet&quot; in a friendly and easy manner, alleviate the problem of parking difficulties, and reduce the occurrence of car-related security cases.
On the other hand, for car owners who refuse to move their cars, park illegally or obstruct traffic, the Xi&#39;an traffic control department stated that the traffic police will take different measures based on the actual situation and deal with them as appropriate.
On August 9, at the cultural tourist attraction of Dihua Ancient Town in Danfeng County, more than 10 young employees of Shangluo Power Supply Company came here to carry out the &quot;Meet the Ancient Town and Love the Electric Power&quot; and our festival-Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day themed activities.
Danfeng County Company of Shangluo Power Supply Company, in conjunction with the construction of spiritual civilization, actively organized and carried out the &quot;Meet the Ancient Town and Love the Electric Power&quot; and our festival, Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day themed activities.
A company employee who participated in the event said: &quot;I usually spend my main energy on work and study, and I lack time and platform to communicate with colleagues and friends.&quot;
&quot;This time the company has provided us with such a relaxed, happy and harmonious platform. I like it very much. It is meaningful and interesting.&quot;
The Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day activity was widely praised by the young employees on site, and they all hope that the company will hold more such activities in the future to strengthen communication and exchanges with more other young people.
The much-watched Beijing Olympic men&#39;s singles champion and Spanish superstar Nadal defeated his opponent in straight sets in the men&#39;s singles match that day and advanced to the quarterfinals. The men&#39;s doubles match also advanced to the finals.
As a Golden Slam winner, Nadal has a special liking for the Olympic Games. Although he has not recovered from his injury, he has made great achievements in this three-line attack.
He and teammate Lopez will compete for the gold medal in the men&#39;s doubles final against Romania&#39;s Tekau and Meguia.
The women&#39;s singles event of the Rio Olympics suffered a number of seed players withdrawing. After several days of fierce competition, the top four women&#39;s singles were all selected on the 11th.
Kvitova will compete with Puig for a ticket to the final, while the other final seat will be between Keys and Kerber.
The semi-finals of the women&#39;s doubles competition have all been produced. The semi-final matches are: Hingis/Basinski vs. Hradka/Hlavakova; Makarova/Vesnina vs. Sterry. Kova/Safarova.
The mixed doubles match held on this day also determined the quarterfinals. However, the loss of the top-seeded combination of Mahu/Garcia and the withdrawal of Natto made the mixed doubles match slightly eclipsed.
On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly issued a new version of the &quot;U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines&quot; in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role around the world.
This is the day when US Secretary of Defense Carter, US Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time a Chinese private think tank has published an assessment report on Japan’s military strength, and the fourth time it has released an English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including overall policy adjustments, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, institutional reform, military training exercises, foreign military security cooperation, military security relations with China, etc.
The report stated that 2015 was the final year of the Abe administration’s major policy adjustments in the security field for several consecutive years.
From now on, Japan&#39;s measures in the security field will mainly be at the operational level such as the application of the legal system, strategic implementation, and policy implementation, rather than major adjustments and changes in frameworks, mechanisms, and policies.
The report emphasizes that the Abe cabinet is trying to make breakthroughs in the above three points to achieve the multiple goals of promoting Japan&#39;s &quot;normal nationalization&quot;, the Self-Defense Forces going out to intervene in international security affairs, strengthening the Japan-US alliance, and preventing and containing China.
Previously, the China Strategic Culture Promotion Association released Japanese military strength assessment reports on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014, and June 30, 2015.
On August 12, the British &quot;Financial Times&quot; published a set of photos of the residence of the US Ambassador to China.
By contrast, the US ambassador&#39;s residence looks like it could be used as a safe house in the next film adaptation of John le Carré&#39;s Cold War spy novel.
The official residence is gray and heavily defended with perimeter fences, a second interior wall, barbed wire and vehicle barricades.
Make up for the shortcomings of public sports facilities
The dark coal yard warehouse has been transformed into a &quot;green grass&quot; football field; the red brick spire factory building has been transformed into a modern sports hall.
On National Fitness Day, the Nanluo Maying Sports and Culture Park outside Wangjiangmen in Hangzhou unveiled its mystery.
It used to be a coal mine, but it has been idle since it was closed more than ten years ago, leaving behind a large amount of illegal construction and domestic waste.
After renovation, it has become a sports and cultural park and will be officially opened to the public in November, providing free sports venues to citizens, which will undoubtedly open up a new fertile ground for national sports.
This reminds people of Hangzhou Chen Jinglun Sports School, the &quot;Whampoa Military Academy&quot; of Chinese swimming circles that has produced many world champions.
The continuous emergence of swimming stars vividly illustrates the relationship between competitive sports and national sports - the rich mass base provides good conditions for the selection of professional athletes.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports. Competitive sports depends on national sports in a certain sense, and national sports depends on venue conditions.
According to reports, as of 2015, although my country&#39;s per capita sports venue area has been 150 times that of when the People&#39;s Republic of China was founded, it still lags far behind the sports powers.
In June this year, the State Council issued the &quot;National Fitness Plan (2016-2020)&quot;, which focused on the development of mass sports.
In order to make up for this shortcoming, on the one hand, relevant departments must fully consider the layout of sports venues when conducting urban planning.
On the other hand, already built public sports venues, including those in schools and other units, should try to expand their opening scope and improve their use efficiency as much as possible.
The Rio Olympics, which is currently in full swing, has inspired people&#39;s enthusiasm for sports and awakened everyone&#39;s awareness of participation.
Gilead wins attorney fees in hepatitis C patent battle with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to attorney fees incurred in a hepatitis C patent lawsuit against pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co., Inc., a U.S. district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was spared from paying two claims that Merck&#39;s blockbuster drugs sofosbuvir and havonib violated the law after a U.S. judge found that the company had committed illegal acts, including perjury and other unethical conduct. US$200 million in damages arising from the patent.
In Thursday&#39;s lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Bess Lambertson Freeman said Gilead would not have to bear the costs of defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs. Gilead&#39;s drugs can cure more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, with each claiming to be the owner of lab work on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead&#39;s drug.
US-backed forces announce they have recaptured Manbij from Islamic State
All remaining Islamic State fighters in the city have left and U.S.-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, a force spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now conducting sweeps across the city after militants who took refuge inside the city left.
Sharan Darwish of the SDF-Alliance&#39;s Manbij Military Council told Reuters they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by militants.
&quot;Manbij is now fully under our control, but we are still carrying out sweeps,&quot; he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% in federal taxes
Hillary Clinton&#39;s 2015 tax returns were released on Friday, showing the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons&#39; charitable donations amounted to $1 million, most of which went to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton&#39;s speaking fees amounted to nearly $5.3 million, and the former secretary of state has a book about her time at the State Department. The book earned $3 million from publisher Simon &amp; Schuster.
Clinton&#39;s running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
The two paid 20.3% federal taxes in 2015.
&quot;Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will continue to set the standard for financial transparency,&quot; Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement. &quot;
In stark contrast, Donald Trump used false excuses to cover up and backtracked on his previous commitment to release his tax returns.
Although not required by law, it is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to release their tax returns.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an IRS audit as a reason for refusing to release his tax returns.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted that it&#39;s up to you and included a link to the Democratic candidate&#39;s tax returns.
Trump&#39;s special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audit is completed.
Trump&#39;s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans, say Trump&#39;s refusal to release his tax returns raises questions about his net worth, charitable contributions, business dealings and various other relationships. doubts, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has seized on the issue to lash out, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his taxes.
She raised the issue during an economic policy speech in Michigan on Thursday.
&quot;He has refused to release his tax returns like other presidential candidates for decades,&quot; she told the crowd.
Trump paid next to nothing in taxes for two years in the 1990s, according to Politico, and a New York Times business columnist quoted multiple tax lawyers and accountants on Friday. , they all said that this may still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named a rule after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that ensures those making more than $1 million a year pay at least 30% in taxes.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway is based, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he is also being audited by the IRS and that what Trump is &quot;fearful of&quot; is not the tax authorities but voters.
The earliest tax returns released by the Clinton campaign are from 2007.
The Clintons, who currently live in Chubbuck, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014, with a combined tax rate of approximately 40.5%.
The Clintons&#39; 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, their salary income was only $100.
Their main investments were low-cost index mutual funds, and the Clintons earned $109,000 in dividends and interest.

Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli phone code at &#39;request&#39; of Arab client - Reuters News
A French film producer of Jewish descent sparked outrage when he revealed to the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli phone codes and that hotel staff said this was at the &quot;request&quot; of an Arab client. Uproar.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his disappointment with the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in Germany&#39;s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
During a recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can make phone calls directly from their rooms.
Israel actually disappeared in Berlin, the capital of Germany, in 2016?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, guests can make calls to Israel through the Kempinski hotel&#39;s call center.
Seeking an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel&#39;s front desk.
Lanzmann said in his letter that he was &quot;shocked&quot; by the response he received at the front desk.
Hotel officials said this was a &quot;deliberate decision made by Kempinski Hotel management.&quot;
And the reasons for doing so made the filmmaker even more outraged.
Lanzmann quoted the employee as saying: Most of our guests are Arabs and they asked that the Israeli code be removed. &quot;
According to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas Handelsmann, called the incident a “gross disgrace.”
We were shocked to learn about this incident.
This itself is a huge shame.
And what happened in Germany and that hotel chain was even more disgraceful.
This requires no explanation.
&quot;We hope the hotel will come to the right conclusion,&quot; the official said.
The incident sparked heated debate online, with everyone considering it a scandal.
Some people think that Kempinski Hotels simply &quot;kowtow&quot; to meet the requirements of Arab customers.
Another post called the hotel &quot;shameless&quot; and pointed out that the hotel is located on the famous Kudam Street near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel quickly clarified all the accusations, claiming it was an &quot;oversight&quot; and &quot;apologised&quot; to Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying: &quot;There was never a direct order to remove Israel from the speed dial list.&quot;
The newspaper also said Israeli codes had been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday during a protest against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to drive away protesters.
The incident began when law enforcement officials tried to disperse the students, so police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the march to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
In order to save money, Sao Paulo State Governor Ocmin plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will transfer to other schools.
Some protesting students expressed their dissatisfaction with interim President Michel Temer through graffiti on the walls.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the country&#39;s Senate.
Scottish cyclist Calm Skinner returns home with glory after winning cycling gold medal
Scottish cyclist Calm Skinner helped the British trio successfully defend their Olympic gold medals from London 2012 in the men&#39;s team sprint at Rio&#39;s Vuelta last night.
The 23-year-old Glaswegian cyclist has replaced his fellow Scot, Sir Chris Hoy, as the backbone of the team. Even the legendary cyclist was proud of the young Skinner when he beat favorites New Zealand and came home with a honour.
Four years ago, Team GB burst onto the scene and Hoy claimed his fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
The British team finished sixth at the World Cycling Track Championships in London in March, and Hoy has since retired. Then, Team GB did it again.
The problem for Team GB between the Beijing and London Games was the replacement of &quot;first lap specialist&quot; Jamie Staff.
That&#39;s exactly what the team did when Hindes showed up.
Hoy&#39;s retirement also leaves a void, which both Cian Imadi and Matt Crampton are looking to fill.
After seeing Skinner&#39;s potential, the coaching staff of the British men&#39;s team insisted that he be selected for the national team, and Skinner eventually lived up to expectations.
Skinner is partnered by Hindes and Kenny, who won gold with Hoy four years ago. The three set new Olympic records in qualifying, but this was surpassed by Team New Zealand in the first round.
And the British Cycling trio ultimately beat their rivals to claim gold.
Although Hindes was slightly behind, Kenny took the lead for the team and Skinner maintained that lead until the end.
A change in strategy was key to this reversal, with Hindes opting for a larger flywheel and therefore slower speed, which allowed Kenny and especially Skinner to maintain speed.
Hoy watched the game as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and Hindes saw him on the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old cyclist from Glasgow, said: &quot;It flatters me.&quot;
I&#39;m just trying my best to make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record and beat the world champions in the final.
This is unbelievable.
There&#39;s nothing better than this win.
After winning gold with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, Hindes admitted to intentionally falling on the track after a poor start.
He later retracted the comments and Team GB&#39;s opponents were unable to appeal.
There was no such problem with this victory.
&quot;It&#39;s like being in London and there are British flags all over the platform,&quot; Hindes said.
We just formed the team three months ago.
We&#39;ve lost a lot of world champions, so to be able to defend the Olympic title is amazing.
For the British team, which won 7 out of 10 track cycling gold medals at the Beijing and London Olympics, it was just one game and one gold medal.
If this is any indication of the progress we have made over the past five months, then we will continue to have success in the velodrome over the next five days.
Based on the form Kenny has shown, it is not impossible for him to repeat Hoy&#39;s feat of winning three gold medals at one Olympics.
If so, 12 years younger than Hoy and also on March 23 (which seems to be a holy day in British sport, as are Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister Born on this day) Kenny will have 6 gold medals and 1 silver medal.
This result is the same as Hoy.
Kenny will next compete in a three-day sprint event starting today.
The 28-year-old Bolton native said: “I’m going to focus on this game for the time being.
Team games are always the best.
You can win games with your teammates.
Frankly, it&#39;s a little lonely winning alone.
Hindes said: &quot;If he can win the other two gold medals, then he should be awarded a knighthood.&quot;
It was the only event of the day that produced a medal, but Team GB received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doyle advanced to the fastest time in the four-person four-kilometre team pursuit.
Their score was 351.943.
The 2012 London Olympics gold medalist&#39;s world record is 351.659.
The first round and final (10:42 pm) will be held on the second match day today, and Wiggins will undoubtedly be the center of attention.
Yesterday he got into an argument with match officials before qualifying when they asked him to have his height measured.
In the women&#39;s competition, which ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rossell Shand, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Millgate set a new world record of 413.260 Advance.
Team GB relied on the strength of its track cycling team to take the initiative in the middle of the Olympics and collect multiple medals.
After showing absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British Cycling team disappointed slightly heading into Rio.
There have been many twists and turns, including the resignation of technical director Sean Sutton in April amid accusations of sexism and bullying and the retirements of legends such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first race night at the velodrome was enough to prove that the British team would once again repeat the legend of reaching the peak in the clutch.
After a little life comes into this world, parents must be responsible for this life. This responsibility lies not only in the physical health of the child, but also in the spiritual development, that is, education.
If you fail in your children&#39;s education, no matter how successful your career is, it cannot make up for the shortcomings in life and the failure of the family.
When a new life is born, new parents need to spend time and energy to take care of and educate the child and be responsible for it.
Responsibility, in addition to physical care and keeping them healthy, also lies in spiritual education, that is, letting children learn how to be a human being, how to be an adult, and how to be successful.
Good family education means that parents need to accompany their children regularly, give them love and patient care, and also teach their children to develop civilized words and deeds so that they can better learn knowledge and improve their intelligence.
Every word and deed of parents will affect the growth of children. They will imitate their parents, which is often said that dragons beget dragons and phoenixes beget phoenixes. The son of a mouse can dig holes. The children will be like the parents.
Therefore, parents need to be a good example in front of their children, standardize their words and deeds, and cultivate their own excellent character. These can indirectly help their children shape a good character and make them better.
Amy is a smart and beautiful girl.
She has an outgoing and lively personality, can get along well with friends, and has good adaptability to the environment.
But Amy has a little secret in her heart: she cannot focus on the study and work tasks she has to do for a long time.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time. Usually the problem is not serious》
Even by studying and working in scattered, modular times, she can basically complete the tasks and achieve good results.
However, when the tasks are heavy and time is tight, Amy feels very painful and tormented.
The purpose of an individual&#39;s resistance to self-exposure and emotional experience is not to threaten the individual&#39;s self-understanding and self-esteem.
Some behaviorist psychologists understand resistance as an individual&#39;s disobedience to behavioral modification.
I tried to let Amy do an exercise to calm herself down through breathing relaxation and feel the suffering.
And once she left the trapped situation, she felt relaxed and free again.
Han, a 63-year-old homeless man, had a drunken argument with another homeless man, Xiao, and stabbed him to death with a knife.
Han said that before the incident, he and the homeless man Xiao lived on the ground in an alley in Dongcheng District, and they were more than 20 meters apart.
Han said that on the day of the incident, they were invited by their friends to drink together, and they had two arguments during and after the meal.
Han said that he was afraid that Xiao would hit him, so he picked up a fruit knife from the garbage dump and stabbed him to death.
In court, the victim&#39;s family demanded compensation from Han for funeral expenses and death compensation, totaling more than 530,000 yuan.
It has been four years since Uber entered the Taiwan market and has had a considerable impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
Taiwan&#39;s &quot;United Daily News&quot; reported on August 12 that more than a hundred taxis bypassed Taiwan&#39;s &quot;Executive Yuan&quot; in protest on the morning of the 12th, causing severe traffic paralysis in the surrounding area.
However, Zheng Lijia, chairman of the Taipei Drivers Union, said that it has been four years since Uber came to Taiwan and the Taiwanese authorities only held a meeting at the end of this month. Drivers can no longer wait.
However, the government broke its promise and kept delaying the process.
Law-abiding taxi drivers, who are at the bottom of the labor force, have to compete with Uber, which is illegal but has no restrictions, and they feel cheated by the authorities.
Original title: 2,000 chickens from a Jiangsu breeding farm were seized by the court and the owner sold them without authorization and was sentenced
After the judgment came into effect, because Li did not automatically perform the obligations determined by the judgment, Wang applied to the Shuyang Court for compulsory execution.
On October 16, 2014, the Shuyang Court issued a civil ruling, ruling that 2,000 laying hens in all Li&#39;s farms should be impounded and should not be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the seizure ruling, Li privately sold some of the seized laying hens in the farm without the permission of the Shuyang Court.
As of March 8, 2015, when the Shuyang County Public Security Bureau conducted an inspection, there were only 142 laying hens left in the farm.
Reporters learned on August 12 that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Winter Games Organizing Committee issued an announcement stating that the Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee will inherit the Beijing Winter Olympics Bid Committee&#39;s emblem, logo and other intellectual property rights.
Without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, no one may use the Beijing Winter Olympics Bid Committee emblem or logo for commercial purposes.
The head of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out here today that excess steel production capacity is a global problem.
In recent years, my country&#39;s capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average, and also higher than that of the United States and Europe and other countries and regions.
Our country has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess production capacity, and the results are gradually showing.
The person in charge pointed out that the Party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to the global problem of excess steel production capacity.
All departments and regions have actively implemented the State Council&#39;s deployment and carried out work conscientiously. This year, crude steel production capacity will be reduced by about 45 million tons.
Based on my country&#39;s national conditions, my country does not encourage steel exports. On the contrary, it has taken a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The person in charge emphasized that international trade of steel products is essentially a market behavior, which is an independent choice based on the needs of the importing country and consumers after comprehensive consideration of factors such as product cost-effectiveness.
Implementing trade protection measures will not help fundamentally solve the development problems of the global steel industry. On the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order.
When talking about debt, the person in charge emphasized that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess production capacity.
Due to the large scale of assets of steel companies and their wide coverage, some companies have complex debt relationships. If they are not handled properly, they may lead to regional risks.
According to the person in charge, in recent years, as the downward pressure on the economy has increased, total social demand has gradually weakened, the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined, and the production and operation difficulties of enterprises have increased.
Some enterprises are unable to adapt to the changes in the market environment, and their production and operations are unsustainable or even on the verge of bankruptcy. However, restricted by some institutional factors, there are many obstacles to exiting in a market-oriented manner, and they have become &quot;zombie enterprises&quot;.
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increases social management costs, and hinders the establishment of a fair competitive market environment.
The main reasons for the losses are the same as the difficulties faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilization.
Our country mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic means and legal measures. The government mainly does a good job in protecting employees and social stability, and ensuring a fair and just market order.
The person in charge emphasized that in the next step, we must unswervingly continue to work on reducing overcapacity and ensure that the target task of reducing crude steel production capacity by 100 million to 150 million tons in five years is completed.
On the afternoon of the 10th, the Chinese tourist police immediately attracted people&#39;s attention when they appeared in Moscow&#39;s Red Square. Chinese tourists waved in surprise, and locals and foreign tourists couldn&#39;t help but stop and look back.
On the same day, members of China’s first professional tourist police team, the Tourist Police Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Sanya City, Hainan Province, came to Moscow’s Red Square to exchange and learn with the local tourist police on duty.
The Moscow tourist police were divided into three groups to perform patrols in Red Square, Nikolsky Pedestrian Street, GUM Department Store and other places. The Chinese tourist police also learned from the patrol. The whole process lasted for more than an hour.
Female police officer Liu Xinye is in her 20s and is proficient in English and Spanish. She just joined the tourist police last year.
Along the way, he carefully observed every word and deed of his Russian counterpart and communicated with her from time to time.
When Spanish tourists came for consultation, the Moscow tourist police patiently explained to them in fluent Spanish, which left a deep impression on Wang Bing.
&quot;Everyone in the Moscow tourist police knows foreign languages, and some can speak two or more languages. This has greatly touched us.&quot;
&quot;Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually paying attention to attracting international tourists. We hope to improve our capabilities to match the status of an international tourist island.&quot;
Before studying on the same day, the Chinese tourist police also went to the Moscow tourist police brigade to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
&quot;I often deal with Chinese tourists and I am very happy to see them traveling to Russia.&quot;
&quot;The questions they usually ask for help are: how to get there, where is a certain monument, how to get a taxi, how to get back to the hotel.&quot;
Rysakov, head of the Moscow Tourism Police Brigade, said that in recent years, Moscow&#39;s urban environment and tourism atmosphere have become better and better, and it is increasingly attractive to foreign tourists.
In order to meet the needs of tourism development, a tourism police team was established in July 2014, responsible for patrolling and protecting major scenic spots, helping and guiding tourists.
Currently, all Moscow tourist police are fluent in English, and some also speak Spanish and German.
The police brigade divided them into nine groups based on their foreign language proficiency. They took classes twice a week to learn self-defense techniques, laws and regulations, and foreign languages.
&quot;Currently, two tourist policemen have begun to learn Chinese and can already speak it well. We will continue to improve their Chinese proficiency,&quot; Rysakov said.
Rysakov told reporters that the Moscow Tourist Police has accumulated a certain amount of experience since its establishment and hopes to inspire its counterparts in Sanya.
He believes that cooperation between the police departments of Russia and China will enhance the sense of security for their citizens traveling to each other&#39;s countries.
&quot;The Moscow Tourist Police&#39;s recruitment, policing model, equipment and good interaction with tourists have brought us a lot of inspiration,&quot; Chen Xiaokun said.
A reporter from China News Network found that at least nine provinces and cities, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian, and Beijing, have issued detailed rules for the implementation of residence permits.
Regarding the conditions for applying for a residence permit, it is generally stated in the above-mentioned areas that one needs to live for more than half a year and meet one of the conditions of legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence, and continuous education.
A reporter from China News Network noticed that the benefits provided by the residence permit vary from place to place. Compared with the national version of the regulations, the scope of public services and conveniences provided in some areas has been expanded.
These areas have made it easier for children to take the local high school and college entrance examinations if they meet relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing and many other places have clearly required that the scope of public services and conveniences be gradually expanded and announced to the public on a regular basis.
For example, Fujian proposed to announce to the public at least every three years the scope of public services and conveniences enjoyed by residence permit holders.
The &quot;Interim Regulations on Residence Permit&quot; stipulate that for those who meet the conditions for applying for a residence permit, the public security organ shall issue a residence permit within 15 days from the date of acceptance.
Regarding the time limit for issuance of certificates, most regions agree with the national version, that is, they will be issued within 15 days.
Hebei has made it clear that for those who meet the application conditions and have complete materials, the public security police station in the place of residence should issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance.
Jiangxi stipulates that if the application conditions for a residence permit are met and the supporting materials are complete, the public security agency shall issue a residence permit within 5 working days from the date of acceptance.
According to the &quot;Interim Regulations on Residence Permit&quot;, the above-mentioned regions have clarified that those who apply for a residence permit for the first time will be exempted from the document production fee.
For example, Sichuan requires that local police stations or entrusted community service agencies must strictly implement the approved charging items and charging standards, and resolutely prohibit exceeding the scope, exceeding the standard charging or charging for rides.
After investigation, it was found that on July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, the former secretary of the Dingnan County Party Committee of Ganzhou City, reported to the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection to work as the director of the Party Style and Political Style Supervision Office (deputy director level, one-year probation period).
The red wine consumed that night was provided by Li Youcai personally, and other expenses were borne by Liu.
The Jiangxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection reported that Chen Yangxia, Cheng Ziliang and others organized and accepted dinner invitations in private clubs, which violated the spirit of the eight central regulations and violated party discipline.
Pogba received two yellow cards in the Italian Cup last season and will be automatically suspended for one game according to the rules.
Although he has transferred back to the Premier League, the Football Association still postponed his cumulative suspension to the Premier League.
As a result, Pogba will sit on the sidelines in the away game against Bournemouth on August 14, and his first show back at Manchester United will be postponed to the home game against Southampton on the 20th.
As the 12th pick in the first round in 2014, Saric will officially land in the NBA next season and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
As a young European player, many fans don&#39;t know much about Saric, but through this Olympics, I believe Saric&#39;s performance has left a deep impression on people.
In Croatia&#39;s last game, which narrowly defeated Spain, Saric successfully blocked Pau Gasol&#39;s rim attack at the last minute in an attempt to drag the game into overtime.
Recently, 76ers coach Brett Brown gave Saric high praise. The Spurs coach believed that he saw the shadow of the young Manu Ginobili in Saric.
Obviously, Saric has shown his talent and the 76ers have high expectations for him.
In Croatia&#39;s first two games at the Olympics, Saric scored a total of 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saric showed his ability to open up space on the court. After passing the pick-and-roll with his teammates, he was able to hit shots from beyond the three-point line.
Although the current 76ers have many talented young players inside, they do not have Saric&#39;s outside ability.
From blocking shots to launching long passes and fast breaks and completing assists, there are only a handful of inside players who can do this in today&#39;s NBA.
Since the start of the Olympics, Saric has averaged 13 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists in 3 games. His performance can be called comprehensive.
Since deciding to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two consecutive 1+1 contracts.
As the NBA&#39;s current collective bargaining agreement is about to enter its final year, as the vice president of the NBA Players Association, James will be at the forefront of collective bargaining agreement negotiations.
With the league&#39;s revenue significantly boosted, thanks to a new television deal, and a battle between owners and players over what to do with the money, there are fears the NBA will be locked down next summer.
But for James, he doesn&#39;t have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer because he has already signed a three-year contract extension with the Cavaliers.
Regardless of when the 2017-18 season officially begins, James is still under contract.
Since the stunning debut of the iPhone SE, the mobile phone market has also ushered in a craze for small-screen phones.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched the first product of its Z11 series: nubia Z11mini.
nubiaZ11mini continues its consistent excellent camera genes and is equipped with a 5.0-inch screen that is easier to hold with one hand and a convenient and easy-to-use rear fingerprint recognition, making it an outstanding user experience.
The price of nubia&#39;s Z11mini, a small-screen camera phone that has just been launched, has been reduced by 200 yuan, from the original 1,499 yuan to 1,299 yuan.
In terms of appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen, and the classic &quot;little red circle&quot; design is still on the lower front.
The middle frame is made of metal, and the bottom adopts a symmetrical design and is equipped with a Type-C data interface.
Future of Portland smelter uncertain as power contract canceled
The Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the site are currently facing uncertainty after the power company that supplies the plant revealed that one of the plant owners would terminate a supply contract, thereby invalidating all supply contracts. future.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue issuing subsidies that kept the factory running.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
2,000 workers at Alcoa&#39;s Portland plant could face unemployment.
Once the factory closes, up to 2,000 people may be directly or indirectly unemployed.
And since the plant accounts for about 10% of Victoria&#39;s total electricity output, there could be knock-on effects.
Alcoa closed its Henry Point smelter in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa&#39;s Portland smelter is currently losing money and at risk of closure.
The move follows forecasts for the factory over the next few years, initially due to the strength of the Australian dollar and more recently due to the price of the factory&#39;s output.
AGL supplies electricity to the large aluminum smelter through the old Eyon power station in the Latrobe Valley. The company predicts that three other plant owners will also terminate their agreements.
The plant&#39;s largest shareholder is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while China&#39;s CITIC Group and Japan&#39;s Marubeni Corporation also hold smaller stakes.
&quot;AGL expects that the Portland plant will continue to operate, meaning that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand,&quot; the joint venture said.
AGL said the contracts were &quot;hedging contracts&quot; that were supposed to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have an end period of 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
&quot;AGL therefore continues to forecast that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal 2017,&quot; the utility said.
Any possible revenue impact on AGL from fiscal 2018 onwards is currently subject to the futures market&#39;s optimistic outlook on wholesale power prices.
AGL said it had written down the value of the contract by $187 million in &quot;anticipation of termination activities.&quot;
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts &quot;will not affect Alcoa&#39;s ability to operate the smelter or ensure power supply to the smelter.&quot;
The American company said it signed a 20-year contract with Eyang in 2010, which was to have come into effect in November this year, but it did not explain why it was withdrawing from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will close due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
Responding to comments made by analysts earlier this week, AGL operations chief Stephen Mickelson said annual electricity use in Portland reaches about 600 megawatts and the Tomago plant reaches about 900 megawatts.
If both plants close, demand in the electricity market will be significantly reduced.
&quot;As a power company, this is not good news for us,&quot; he said.
Community legal centers turn away 160,000 people every year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from community legal centers every year. The service is already strapped for funding and is now facing further funding cuts.
Three in five people in Queensland are turned away from free legal advice and representation, with the majority being the elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the resources to fight unfair eviction.
Community legal services are already underfunded and now face further funding cuts.
From next June, federal funding for these legal centers will be reduced by a further 30 per cent.
Queensland Community Legal Center director James Farrell said thousands of people were being turned away every year, according to the latest National Community Association Legal Center survey report.
Mr Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not reverse its current decisions.
&quot;Queensland&#39;s community legal centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people will be unable to access the vital services they need,&quot; he said.
People who need to escape violence, people with huge debts they cannot repay, families facing disintegration, and squeezed workers are all facing legal problems and the report shows they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by another 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland MP George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts so people can get the help they need when facing legal issues.
Last year the state government committed to increasing legal aid funding to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to the needs of community legal centers and the communities they serve, and the White House government must engage in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer pulled gun
NEW YORK: Trump&#39;s campaign is being sued over its failure to act after its Northern California director pulled a gun on a staffer while driving a Jeep in February.
Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign, described the incident Wednesday in state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said he had hoped the matter would be resolved internally, but after waiting for months he realized &quot;that wasn&#39;t going to happen.&quot;
According to Bordini&#39;s account, the officer in charge, Earl Phillip, &quot;pulled out a pistol, placed his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the muzzle of the gun at Vincent&#39;s kneecap.&quot;
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned from the dossier that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
&quot;The fact that no shots were fired does not mean that no harm was caused,&quot; Bordini said in the complaint.
The case comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate told a crowd in North Carolina that &quot;people who support the Second Amendment&quot; would be better off if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, were elected and picked judges she favored. That&#39;s what gun owners and gun enthusiasts might do, and the statement sparked outrage.
Trump&#39;s campaign said the media took his words out of context and that he did not advocate violence.
In his complaint, Bordini asked the campaign to compensate him for neglect of supervision, and also asked Philippe to compensate him for assault, battery and emotional distress.
Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Philip could not be reached.
According to WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign team.
His consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not immediately respond to a call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump&#39;s campaign has been beset by controversy.
The case is between Bordini and the Trump Presidential Campaign, Inc., 16-CS-14300, Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) Superior Court, General Division.
Britain must channel Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our communities, London and the country.
For me, that&#39;s the beauty of Heathrow, just as we did with London 2012, we did everything we could to ensure our country and region benefited from these events.
Stratford and the East End benefited greatly from the Olympics.
And we will once again benefit the area by creating opportunities for local people and businesses around Heathrow.
In our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and lift young people around the airport out of unemployment.
Just as before the 2012 London Olympics, some people thought that the Heathrow expansion project was too big.
I was told that Britain would not be ready for the Olympics and that we would be embarrassed in front of the world.
The doubters were wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and they will be proven wrong about the Heathrow project.
While there will always be obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is addressing every issue faced.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not the few.
The expansion project will create up to 180,000 new jobs and bring £211 billion of economic growth, leaving a wealth of skills and employment around the airport and across the UK.
We have a fantastic Heathrow project team. The team has delivered £11bn of infrastructure investment projects on time and on budget, including T5, voted the world’s best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and T2, located between two of the world’s busiest runways Terminal.
Now they are preparing to build a third runway with £16bn of private investment.
The UK successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion project will also be a huge success.
Now is a great time for us to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow so we can secure our future and create a wealth of skills and jobs that the UK can be proud of.

Woman commits suicide and is run over to death on Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman who attempted suicide was run over by multiple vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning. Police are currently looking for witnesses.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges, canton Vaud, in the early hours of Thursday morning.
Vaud cantonal police said a woman lay &quot;desperately&quot; on the road late at night and was run over by multiple vehicles.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, acted with clear suicidal intent. She was run over by multiple vehicles, including a lorry.
The woman died at the scene.
Police revealed that many drivers involved have been investigated, but some drivers have yet to be identified. Police are currently appealing for them and witnesses to the accident to come forward for investigation.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told the Tribune de Genève that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is routine procedure for such incidents.
It is not yet known if any of the drivers will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collision?
&quot;That will be determined by prosecutors,&quot; Hofstetter said.
The driver will not be held liable based on the outcome of two other similar cases in the past five years.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by people walking onto the highway late at night. The final verdict was that the driver could not have anticipated a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year a police officer was charged with negligence causing death after she struck and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Payenne in August 2014.
The court heard the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking alcohol.
After the investigation, the judge said that the female police officer&#39;s driving behavior at the time was completely legal, and that the man&#39;s appearance on the road was &quot;completely unexpected and unforeseen circumstances&quot;, and the female police officer called the emergency phone afterwards.
Anyone with information about the incident near Morges on Thursday should contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was once habitable, according to predictions from NASA&#39;s new climate model.
Scientists at NASA&#39;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model that explores Venus&#39; past conditions, using tools and algorithms very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was used to determine whether Venus, which has a hot surface, no water and an atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, once had an environment similar to Earth.
Previously, scientists believed that Venus&#39; slow rotation was due to its thick atmosphere.
But new simulations suggest Venus may have once had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere and a similarly slow rotation.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but there once was enough water and geographic variation to support life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the brightness of sunlight shining on Venus was 30% dimmer than that of Earth.
Anthony Del Genio, a scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, explained in a press release: &quot;In the Goddard Institute for Space Studies&#39; model simulations, Venus&#39;s slow rotation causes daylight hours to last nearly two days on one side. months.&quot;
This warms the surface and creates rain that creates thick clouds that act like an umbrella and block much of the sun&#39;s heat from the ground.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually several degrees cooler than that of Earth today.
The model simulates the evolution of Venus that is similar to what planetary scientists previously speculated.
Although life may have once existed on Venus, over the course of billions of years, Venus was exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet light.
The planet&#39;s oceans evaporate, and the water vapor is burned away by ultraviolet light.
As the hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and its deadly greenhouse gas effect, creating the planet we know today.
The researchers published simulations from a new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey team on Thursday, saying he had no say in the team&#39;s decision-making.
Colorado executive vice president and general manager Joe Sakis confirmed the news and said the club will begin its search for a new head coach immediately.
&quot;Over the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,&quot; Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I spent the summer thinking hard about how we could improve this team and get it to the next level.
To do this, the goals of the head coach and vice-president must be aligned with those of the club.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team&#39;s performance.
But currently, these conditions are not met.
Sarkis hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and expressed his gratitude for Roy&#39;s contribution to the team.
&quot;Patrick informed me today of his decision,&quot; Sakis said.
We would like to thank him for his contribution to the club and wish him well in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award for the league&#39;s top coach in his first season coaching the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He helped the club score 112 points, ranking first in the Central Division. But Colorado was eliminated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the playoffs in the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the Avalanche had a record of 39 wins, 39 draws and 4 losses, and ultimately lost the second wild card qualification for the Western Conference by 5 points.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two each while playing for the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oilfield workers end strike, continue talks
Workers in the North Sea oil fields have called off a strike over pay, the chief negotiator said, as parties to the dispute began a new round of talks.
There have been several strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group on North Sea oil platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, &quot;Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute.&quot;
We will revisit these issues in a number of full-day meetings over the coming weeks, starting early next week.
The union said its recent action was to protest pay cuts that could reach up to 30%, and it was the first time the union had taken such action in 25 years.
Wood Group has reduced pay for North Sea contractors by about 9% this year due to market pressures.
The pay cut follows a 10% reduction in pay for offshore contractors in 2014.
The company said another wage cut would help it weather the market recession.
Shell has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to shut down oil and gas facilities in 10 countries as it needs to streamline its operations following its merger with British energy company BG.
Energy companies are facing pressure from falling crude prices and Britain&#39;s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labor dispute in a generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea was vital to the regional economy.
&quot;In the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for the many, not the few,&quot; Dave said in a statement.
Spending on new North Sea projects is expected to be no more than $1.4 billion in 2016, compared with average project spending over the past five years reaching about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the Pleiades cluster stars
This latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete picture of the rotation rates of the stars in the Pleiades cluster.
New data are helping astronomers understand why the cluster&#39;s stars spin at different rates and how the rotation period correlates with the planet&#39;s composition.
&quot;We hope to learn more about the relationships between stars&#39; masses, ages, and even their solar system histories by comparing our results to other star clusters,&quot; Lusa Reible, a research scientist at Caltech&#39;s Center for Infrared Processing Analysis in Pasadena, said in a news release. relation.&quot;
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are still just reaching adulthood.
They reach the highest spin rate in their lifetime.
At their highest spin rates, these mature stars eject massive stellar winds.
As these stellar winds pass through the star&#39;s magnetic field, they exert a braking effect on the star.
As a star ages, its rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measured the rotation rate of each star by tracking the occurrence of identifiable star spots, like sunspots.
The latest rotation speed data set shows that more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compared the stars to dancers, with larger dancers spinning more slowly than smaller ones.
&quot;In the &#39;ballet&#39; of the Pleiades, we find that stars that spin more slowly tend to be more massive, while stars that spin the fastest tend to be the lightest stars,&quot; Rebull said.
Because of its close proximity, the Pleiades star cluster serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing stellar masses and rotation rates.
&quot;The Pleiades provided the basis for theoretical models of bidirectional rotation of young and old stars,&quot; Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotations and &quot;put away their dancing shoes.&quot;
Rebull and her colleagues detail their latest analysis of the Pleiades cluster&#39;s rotation rate in three new papers. The three papers will be published soon in the Astronomical Journal.
Zheng Jianjun, chief of the Water Management Section of Nanhu Park, said that the deepest point at the bottom of Nanhu Lake is more than 10 meters, and those who enter the water without understanding the situation are likely to be in danger.
&quot;Although the Nanhu rescue team is very professional, we still hope that boating tourists can wear life jackets, refrain from illegal actions on the lake, and play safely,&quot; Zheng Jianjun said.
Weitou Village is blessed with a unique marine environment and two major leisure tourism resources, natural ecology and human ecology.
&quot;However, individual owners who have purchased parking spaces in the community are afraid that doing so will affect the rental price of their own parking spaces, and they also suspect that others have selfish motives, so they have been sabotaging the project behind the scenes, causing the parking space renovation to be shelved.&quot;
There are still different opinions in academic circles on when and by whom sweet potatoes were introduced.
According to the current mainstream view, there are three main routes for the introduction of sweet potatoes.
Among the three lines of sweet potato introduction, the one with the greatest influence and wide spread was Chen Zhenlong’s introduction to Fuzhou from the Philippines.
The Beijing Municipal Social Group Management Office will launch a special inspection on the use of unified receipts for social group membership fees from now on.
Inspections are divided into two types: unit self-inspection and focused spot inspection.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Municipal Societies Office, the scope of this inspection includes social groups that received unified receipts for social group membership fees from the Municipal Societies Office from 2013 to 2015.
The Rio Olympic Organizing Committee said in the Olympic Communication Strategy formulated in 2012: &quot;The success of the Olympic Games is defined by the people who share their stories on social media.&quot;
Judging from the reports of this Olympic Games, various media have made great changes compared with the past in many aspects such as communication methods, product forms, language styles, and news perspectives.
The International Olympic Committee and media practitioners around the world seem to be ready to meet this round of challenges.
On August 11, the public offering of H shares of Everbright Securities entered the last day. Sources pointed out that the market response was muted in the two days before the IPO. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
An analyst at a domestic securities firm said that Orient Securities’ foundation in Hong Kong is not very good, and its asset management business is the strength of Orient Securities. Compared with bank-based securities firms such as Bank of China International and CITIC Securities, it appears to be inherently deficient.
Experts pointed out that since the beginning of this year, as the securities market has returned to dullness, the performance of many securities companies has declined. However, the situation after the company is listed depends more on the development of the company&#39;s own business and cannot be generalized.
After the introduction of this new regulation, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city in the country to restart purchase restrictions.
The second-tier cities that have introduced or are about to introduce property market control policies are not only Suzhou, but also Hefei, Nanjing and other cities.
Previously, Hefei has taken the lead in issuing a loan restriction policy. For home buyers who have two houses in Hefei and one housing loan has not been settled, banks will refuse to provide mortgage services.
