At the Royal Academy of Sciences of Cambodia, Confucius College, the Chinese-language essay contest "The Chinese in My Heart" was unveiled.
The Chinese essay contest on the theme “China in My Heart” on the 70th anniversary of the new China was inaugurated at the Confucius College of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Cambodia and an award ceremony was held.
The award was presented to the award-winning guests by the diplomats of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, as well as by the representatives of the Congregation of the Congregation of Cambodia and the President of the Jiangxi Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia.
According to the Chinese Director of the Confucius College of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Cambodia, Chakqing, the competition lasted two months and was attended by Cambodian pupils, secondary school students (including special students) and university students (including social workers).
Diplomats from the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia also awarded the award of the award to the first prize winner of the university group, Lin Wei-Tian, and the first prize winner of the primary and secondary school groups, Guo Lina.
Zachking indicated that the entries were divided between university groups and primary and secondary schools, and that senior Cambodian Chinese-speaking experts were invited to review committees, which resulted in the selection of one first prize, two second prizes, three prizes and 10 prizes; one prize, five prizes and 10 prizes and 20 prizes from primary and secondary schools.
The first prize winner of the university group, Lin Weiwei, said that he had studied Chinese for 15 years and had had a great impact on himself.
Through the essay contest, which describes in words the well-being of Cambodia and the traditional friendship between China and Cambodia, it is hoped that the younger generation will continue to build on the Chinese-Cambodian friendship.
The figure is for guests and winners.
Guo Lina, the first-class winner of the primary and secondary school group, said that as an overseas Chinese, there was a different excitement about the opportunity to express the feelings of “China in the heart” and to win the award through the language of the country of origin.
The sponsors indicated that the competition had not only created a positive atmosphere for China-China relations, but had also attracted an increasing number of Cambodian students to learn Chinese and study abroad in China.
The report published by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 26 June indicated that Iran had begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, in further violation of the nuclear agreement reached with the world's major Powers in 2015.
According to a comprehensive external report, the IAEA report states that the advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility are “accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium”.
Since United States President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear agreement with the major Powers.
The agreement provided that Iran could use only the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges to refine uranium.
The other signatories to the agreement, the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany and Russia, had been trying to salvage it, but Tehran had repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to the Japan Joint News Agency, in the afternoon of 25 local time, Japan's Foreign Minister, Motoaki, met with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, where he visited, confirming that the conclusion of peace treaty negotiations covering the four northern islands (the disputed islands of Russia and Russia, known as “the four northern islands”, and Russia as “the South Korean islands”) would be advanced and that relations between the two countries would be developed in a wide range of political, economic and other areas, and that agreement had been reached between the two sides to coordinate his early visit to Russia.
This was the first consultation with the Russian Federation as the head of the negotiations for the conclusion of a peace treaty since Shigeki took office as Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Maori said to the Russian side, “including the promotion of joint economic activities (on the northern islands) in the hope of effective consultation.”
According to the Government of Japan, the talks did not discuss the Territory in detail.
At the Russian summit meeting in December 2018, it was confirmed that the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, in their capacity as heads of State, should expedite the negotiations.
At that meeting, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress made in the consultations on joint economic activities in the areas of tourism and waste disposal.
Shigeki expressed the expectation that the tourism pilot operation, scheduled for October, would “hope to be successfully implemented, leading to the next step”.
In addition, the meeting confirmed the visit of Lavrov to November in conjunction with the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Group of Twenty (G20) in Nagoya.

The next Tongan parliamentary elections will be held in 2021.
The women's platoon is expected to champion the World Cup ahead of time!
On 27 September, in a competition against the Dutch women's platoon, the Chinese team was brought back to the city by the opponent after winning two games in a row, culminating in a victory of three to one in the Netherlands.
The World Cup is nearing its end, but the Chinese women's platoon must not be taken lightly in the face of the Serbian team.
In the first two rounds of the competition with the Netherlands, the Chinese women's platoons were as strong as ever, falling down at 25:19, 25:16, until the third round, when the team suffered a setback.
The Dutch women's ranks have increased the aggressiveness of their serve while falling behind, and the Chinese team has been hit, and the girls'aggressive intentions and failures have begun to increase, leading to their return to a city with their rivals at 21:25.
In an interview with Xijiang Ping, he also pointed out: “The third round, we sent about eight points because of a mistake.”
Of course, the Dutch women's platoons were not less powerful, and the Chinese women's platoons were hard prepared before the race, but they lost a game, but everything was still in Lamping's hands: “It's normal to win and win a fight with a strong team, and it's normal to win, so we said to the players,” he said.
In the fourth round, the players actively adjusted their positions, Zhang Changning opened fire at the attack and received eight points in the single round, giving the team a great deal of credit.
So far, the 11 rounds of confrontation have left only two rounds, and while one hand has touched the championship, it is true that in the competition against the Dutch team, the Chinese women were alerted: the more critical the moment, the harder the effort will be.
In another game, on 27, the Russian and American women's rows were filled with five rounds, and the United States team was not able to score all three points from their opponents, so that the Chinese women's platoon could be crowned in one round ahead of the battle against Serbia.
All things are moving towards a situation favourable to the Chinese women's platoon.
However, while the Serbian team has lost all its strength, this does not mean that they would easily send three points to the Chinese team.
In the current form of the scoreboard, the Serbian team has largely lost its medals, which means that they can “be light” in the competition against Chinese women in order to put down their loads and hit their opponents with full force, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win, and the situation is likely to rise and fall.
In addition, the replacement Serbian team was not a “sculpted” lamb, as evidenced by the depth of its thickness, as evidenced by the fact that in the five rounds of the war with the Netherlands, the Serbian 2nd team eventually reversed the Dutch all-power stance at 3:2.
Before the third stage of the game, Luang Ping also said that both teams would be tough: “The match in Osaka will be very difficult, and we have to prepare carefully, as we have always done.”
Now that the horn of the crown has been blown, the game has really entered the “white heat stage”.
In terms of strength, the Chinese women's platoon is above the rivals, but it is only the last moment of importance, and it is up to the girls to be able to play their normal role in releasing themselves from the playing field.
On this (27) day, the University of Macao organized the “Second Macao stem cell seminar”, which attracted more than 100 experts from countries and regions such as the United States, Singapore, the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao in the field of “offer stem cell” research, to share and explore the latest technologies and developments in stem cell research with teachers and students at the University of Macao.
The Vice-Chancellor (Research) of Australasia stated that stem cell research was of medical value and was one of the major research projects in Australasia, and that a seminar had helped to advance research and development in the field of stem cells in Macao.

The seminar brought together experts in stem cell research, both within and outside the country, to share the latest technology, which will help to promote stem cell research and development in Macao.
The Director of the Australian Institute of Health Sciences, Deng Xuexia, said that in recent years Australia had continued to strengthen scientific innovation and transformation, with significant improvements in the number and quality of papers, and that it had also achieved fruitful results in stem cell research.
At the conference, a group of eminent scholars shared cutting-edge knowledge and cutting-edge technology in stem cell research.
Member of the Chinese Academy and Director of the School of Pulses Conversion of the Yunnan Kunming University of Science and Technology, Tyu Wi Ji, explained the process of studying the outside of monkeys and human embryos and their molecular mechanisms using the 3D culture system; researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Biochemical Cells at the Chinese Academy of Sciences described temporal and temporal changes in the decisions and organization of the cell spectrometry of the embryos in mice from single-cell and molecular levels; and Professor Wang Yung of Pennsylvania State University showed how biomaterial hydrogels can be used to simulate dry cell nests for survival and transmission.
The Vice-Dean (Research) of the Australian Academy of Health Sciences, Seo-in and Assistant Dean Chen Kuo-kay and Associate Professor Wang Chun-ming of the Australasia Academy of Medicine, respectively, presented their most recent and important results.
The second Macao stem cell seminar was hosted by the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Macao, co-sponsored by the Chinese Institute of Medicine of the University of Macao and the National Priority Laboratory for Quality Studies of the Macao University of Science and Technology, with the participation of the Acting Senior Manager of the Macao Foundation for the Development of Science and Technology.
The seminar consisted of 11 academic reports on embryo development and organization, conversion medicine, stem cell institutional research and conversion applications, biological materials and applications.
The workshop was a lively one, and participants actively discussed and shared the latest research and ideas on relevant technologies.

Stoltenberg, speaking at the West Point military school of the United States, said: “For 70 years, NATO’s containment and defense measures have been based on preserving technical superiority.”
He said, but the times are changing.
Stoltenberg said, “We are experiencing increasing competition.
So now we should redouble our efforts in order to be sure that no one will exceed us."
He said: “Some of the new technologies have not been developed by NATO members, but in authoritarian countries.
Chinese companies are studying the 5G network.

On September 24, “a ticket to show me how to help people with disabilities” took place in Changsha State Head, where more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to the Orange Star Cruise to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Most of the more than 100 persons with disabilities who attended the event were boarded for the first time on a cruise ship.
Zhao Zhengung, 56 years old, is a crippled person and usually rarely leaves the home due to mobility problems on both his feet.
He said, “For the first time today, on a cruise ship, he was close to the vast waves of the Gang, feeling the development pulse of Changsha, very excited and unforgettable.”
Volunteers from the Fukuon Social Work Centre and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City provided sophisticated services to persons with disabilities.
Specially for clients with severe physical disabilities, volunteers carry them up and down the liner.
According to the head of the Fukuoka Social Work Centre, over the past 70 years the cause of persons with disabilities in Changsha City has continued to progress with the support of the party and the Government, with an increasing number of persons with disabilities becoming real participants, contributors and beneficiaries of socio-economic development.
The Republic is about to celebrate its seventieth anniversary, and the spotlights of the media on all roads are glittering and glowing, and it's them who bring heat and light to our bright days, silk glitters...
However, if a hero walks around, it looks like you're just like me.
Yuan Yongping, a deep-seated rice researcher, has produced good seeds to spread throughout the world, leaving one billion people at risk of hunger and loss of credit. He is also an old farmer who likes to grow up in the fields. Nan In-dong, a leading scientist who's so eager to make China's sky-eyed, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a pot, for a lifetime, who eats cold buns in the deep mountains of Guizhou, and a man in the nest, who's not much like him; Zhou Chang, a red scientist, a village boy who's so late in his life, who's still like a red son, who learns in the middle and west and who's full of hair, who talks about his heart, who likes to laugh; Qin Yi, a movie artist who's half-a-day in front of him, who, after nine or ten years of age, is happy to be an old maid who's name in the Highlands...
And those who seek to be pure, pure and committed, so long as they are immersed in a cause in which the outsiders do not understand and which they cherish, it is easy for them to rejoice, not to think of a name, and to be rich and prosperous.
As in the golden novel, the temple of Shaolin hides the razed monk of the Cabinet, despite the horrors of martial arts and the lack of flair and joy.
Every Monk, every son of a bitch, has a share of his country that belongs to me.
Our country assumes responsibility not only on the shoulders of heroes but also in the hands of hundreds of millions of people.
Once upon a time, a girl in high school went crazy by the Internet, "When a hero passes, someone has to sit on the side of the road and applaud... and I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a guy sitting on the side of the road."
In fact, there is no contradiction between being a hero and being a hero.
People who applaud on the side of the road are also passing heat and light and are also glowing.
Just as you are me, there are opportunities in life, and there are moments, and there is a build-up of heroes.
In Shanghai, a fine judge, Joo Beihua, who took responsibility for judicial reform, brought the messenger teacher to tell his story at the annual conference, sent numerous newspaper letters a year, never wrong, “doing the simple thing right, it's not easy”, and Zau Beihua led the judges to give a round of applause to this old ‘scrubbing monk’.
It's between heroes. It's a hero who applauds another hero.
Shaolin temples are hidden in the temple, Yuan Longping has a vast rice field, Nan Indong has the Sky-Eye, Qin Yi has the stage, and Zhou Chang has the platform whether he can be a hero, not only by his own efforts, but also a better environment and a positive incentive mechanism.
China SkyEye, for example, is now a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese scientific and technological community was still struggling to climb the slopes, and the novelist Liu Tse Xin has yet to write " Three Bodies ".
The best “eye” at that time, the single-gauge radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico Island – Arecibo, 350 meters in diameter – was considered to be the largest in a world “unbeyond.”
At that time, the Chinese radio telescope was less than one tenth in diameter.
But Nan In-dong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home, bringing back an almost insane idea: building a new generation of radio “big telescopes” in China to receive more messages from outer space.
China's got a lot of money to play with the stars, don't you think?
The motherland trusted Nan In-dong, and the "Eye of Heaven" project began.
It took 12 years to select the site and nine years to set it.
The 500-metre “Eye of Heaven” opened, and China became an unprecedented “unique scientific engineering in the world”.
So, the Eye of Heaven is remarkable, the South In-dongs are remarkable, and the Republic, which has great tolerance and greatness, is remarkable.
With the trust of the State and the goodwill of its citizens, the South In-dongs have the opportunity to become the people of the nation.
A country with young talent, white-haired heroes who walk by, and people who applaud lightly on the side of the road, is beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage classification education begins at Gilling's kindergarten, and the idea of environmental protection begins with a doll.
On 27 September, a kindergarten in Gilling City, Jilin Province, introduced a garbage classification education course to teach young children how to identify recyclable waste and other types of waste.
This is known to be the first time that garbage is classified into local early childhood education classes.
A programme of work for the promotion of the classification of waste in urban life at the local level in Jilin province was launched jointly by nine departments in Jilin province.
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot compulsory classification of household waste in Changchun City, the province decided to carry out the classification of household waste in local cities.
Gilling City is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to achieve the role of a young child as a family, a kindergarten as a social enabler and an environmentalist.
The executive director of the Fong Children's International Kindergarten said that the event had been organized.
On the same day, the Director read out an environmental initiative, hoping that garbage would be sorted from the children.
After performing the " Low Carbon Babe " dance, the children grouped themselves into a little game of garbage sorting.
The tutor also issued the " Recoverable " " " Other Garbage " label and advised the children to stick the label on the trash bin and make small videos when they returned home.
Liu Lilong reported that the kindergarten has been promoting the concept of low-carbon, green and environmentally friendly, and has regularly opened environmental workshops.
Classifiable waste cans have also been installed at the dump site in the park, where the type of dropout is indicated.
Teacher taught the kids what recycling garbage is.
According to preliminary statistics, in 2018 in Jilin province, the amount of waste generated in urban areas amounted to some 54,652,000 tons, all of which went to the domestic waste disposal yard for disposal.
Of this total, 32.92 million tons were landfilled in sanitary conditions, 2,092 million tons were burned and 80.1 million tons were treated using integrated processes.
After many years of efforts, all municipalities and counties of the province have the capacity to treat household waste in a manner that is not harmful.
In the Work Programme for the Promotion of the Classification and Disposal of Land-based Municipal Waste in the Jilin Province, which has been published, there is a clear call for further activities such as the classification of waste into schools, textbooks, classrooms, and the promotion of interaction between students and parents through the creation of songs, songs, cartoons, microvideos, etc., with a view to “teaching a child, influencing a family, promoting a community and nurturing a new generation”.
According to data released on 27 September in Madda, global sales in August amounted to 117,015 vehicles.
Sales in China declined by 21 per cent as a result of the impact, inter alia, of the underinvestment of new vehicles and the reduction in prices.
In Japan, domestic sales fell by 6%, and there was limited demand for the last bus before the consumption tax increase in October.
In August, Majuta’s sales in China amounted to 17729.
In August 2018, it was also 13 per cent lower than in the previous year, and sales continued to decline.
China's dedicated main SUV “CX-4” sales decreased by 14%.
“CX-4” has been on the market for a long time since 2016, and the effect of new vehicles has declined.
Reductions in prices as a result of strategies to raise brand value from a long-term perspective are also known to have a significant impact on sales.
Madheda’s sales in the United States grew by 7 per cent on a year-on-year basis, reaching 27482 vehicles, which grew 14 months later.
In August, the vendor’s business days were one more day than in the previous year, combined with “enhancement of promotional activities such as publicity” (Majeda), which led to an increase in sales of SUV “CX-5” etc.
In Japan, domestic sales fell by 6 per cent to 14422.
According to the company, the emergency purchase before the tax increase was “not as high as in the previous case (2014)”.
The sales of cars such as "Demio" have been reduced.
The death of Chirac and the perpetuation of the political legacy.
On 26 local time, former French President Chirac died and was 86 years old.
At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of great change, the many political legacies left by the French politician when he came to power in that year are still worthy of our praise.
Chirac was President of France for 12 years in a very personal way.
He has inherited the diplomatic spirit of de Gaulle independence and steadfast support for European integration, representing the pursuit of the “European Dream”.
At the same time, he was a strategic statesman, a strong advocate of multipolarity and multilateralism in the world.
That is why the French media rate him as “a distinguished representative of France on the world stage”.
One of the promising political decisions of Chirac is to oppose the United States-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, stood up to the pressure of the United States and was at the forefront of the war against it.
A year after the outbreak of the war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an increase in terrorist activity and make the world even more dangerous.
Later on, it proved that Chirac's warning was quite correct.
In a time of European integration and the growing prominence of the unilateralism of the United States, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices in international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly highly instructive.
Chirac is also a French politician who is familiar and friendly to the Chinese.
He was one of the protagonists and creators of the “Golden Decade” of Chinese-French relations, which, after his first election as President of France in 1995, was driven rapidly by the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and China entered a completely new phase.
During the period of Chirac, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and cooperation between the two countries in various areas, such as aviation, nuclear energy and rail transport, has made ground-breaking progress.
The Meso-French Cultural Year of the Chirac Initiative has created a completely new model of cultural exchange in the history of China.
Chirac was particularly impressed with Chinese culture throughout his life.
It is known to his Chinese diplomats that Chirac is able to recite some of Li Bai's and Dupu's poems and even to judge accurately the history of China's bronze apparatus.
“Don’t look at the pyramids as if they were actually in Egypt or Qin as if they were in China” – this gold phrase comes from Chirac.
“The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth, and China's political status at the international level.
But I have confidence in China myself.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization whose experience is sufficient to help it build ideas and values for harmonious development and to shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time.”
I also believe that the revival of China will bring new creative vitality to the world culture and enrich it.
The people have gone, but the political legacy and inspiration that Chirac left to the world will last forever.

Members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region co-sponsored an anti-American Hong Kong bill.
In a joint statement issued on 27 July by some of the members of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR, a strong opposition was expressed to the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 by the Foreign Council of both Houses of Congress of the United States Congress.
This statement, which was co-sponsored by 40 formed members of Parliament, states that the rights currently enjoyed by Hong Kong are conferred by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including the maintenance of the status of free trade ports and separate customs zones, the conclusion and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements in the various fields of the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports in the name of “Hong Kong, China” and in the name of cooperation and development with different countries and regions of the world.
These rights are not exercised by any foreign Government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always been in strict compliance with international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, engaged in business with different countries and regions, and engaged in cooperation in a wide range of related fields.
The statement stated that it was not necessary for the United States Senate and the Foreign Affairs Committee to pass the bill in question, but rather to respond to the calls of its agents in Hong Kong, as a means of gross interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs and of securing political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong.
Formed parliamentarians expressed their deep regret that the United States would do so and strongly opposed it.
The statement noted that Hong Kong was an important trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus for the United States.
The good rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society in Hong Kong make it a good place for American businessmen to run their business.
The adoption of the bill in the United States would, in addition to undermining the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, further aggravate the relationship between China and the United States without any benefit or detriment to others.
The statement states that Hong Kong will remain committed to the principle of “one country, two systems” and will continue to enjoy the rights enshrined in the Basic Law and to fulfil its obligations effectively.
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international commerce, whether in the past, the present or the future.
According to the 26th edition of the European Times, the two chambers of the French Parliament will discuss migration policy reform next week.
French President Markron recently claimed that France could not “take everyone” but at the same time try to “better accept” it.
It was reported that Markron had attempted to find a compromise route in immigration matters and to mitigate the impact of the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview in New York, United States, during the general debate of the General Assembly, Markron expressed the hope that there would be a genuine “two-pronged” approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Markron said, “If France wants to be properly admitted (immigrants), it will not be able to accept everyone”.
Markron identified four priorities for immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more efficient integration of migrants; reception and protection of all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of those who entered France illegally and were not fit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the AME system has been the subject of much discussion in previous circles.
Markron indicated that he wished to be able to “assess” the system, but not to eliminate it, but to limit it to certain limits.
Following these statements by Markron, the extreme right-wing leader of the National Union, Le Pompas, stated that Markron had taken the position of “empty talk”.
Members of the right-wing Republican party, the President of the Senate, Rasher, also expressed the view that immigration policy should be discussed in a “moderated” but “counter-real” manner, indirectly criticizing Markron.
The leftist Socialist Congressman Valau argued that, in the case of immigration, France should “take more and better” and criticize Markron for “wiping” the subject.
Reports indicate that a new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been in place for one year and that it has led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but at the same time it has not been possible to appease the right-wing opposition party.
In the next general election in 2022, the topic of immigration policy will again be the focus of an extreme right-wing attack, and Markron will need to make a difference on this issue, but at the same time he will run the risk of enraged left-wing elements within the ruling party.
It was reported that the lower house of the French National Assembly would start a debate on immigration policy on 30 September and the Senate on 2 October.
There are indications that China’s A shares are “backloading” and that many listed companies are buying back their shares with “real gold and silver”.
According to statistics on Eastern wealth of financial data service providers, in 2019 the total amount of repurchases by A-listed companies was more than 100 billion yuan (RMB, lower than in previous years), far exceeding the figures for the same period, and the amount of repurchases by A-stocks was the highest in history.
In response, Xuyang, Chairman of McCoron Information Consulting Limited, Shanghai, stated that the overall valuation of the A share market this year was low and that repurchase of shares at relatively low prices was conducive to more efficient use of funds by listed companies, as well as to the willingness of listed companies to manage market value and cash flows, and to boost investor confidence.
In addition, a well-developed equity buy-back system has also encouraged listed companies to actively engage in stock buy-backs.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued implementing regulations for repurchase of shares by listed companies, providing detailed regulations and guidelines for repurchase of shares by listed companies.
Also according to media statistics, since this year, listed companies with increased buy-back schemes have been concentrated in the capital sector, the real estate sector, the information technology industry and the electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, in terms of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased more than $1 billion this year.
The first of these is the IRI shares, which buy back more than $5 billion.
What is the impact of stock buy-backs by listed companies on the market?
In an interview with a Chinese news agency journalist, the Vice-President of the Financial and Financial Institute of the People's University of China, Zhao Si Jun, stated that repurchases showed, on the one hand, that listed companies had a stronger economic power and a better financial position and were capable of maintaining stable stock prices and giving confidence to investors, and, on the other hand, that listed companies and their controlling shareholders were accountable to companies, to markets and to investors.
The former is based on the good business performance of the company, while the latter requires a high quality of the listed company and its controlling shareholders.
These are the most central building blocks for capital markets.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies has helped to boost investor confidence and has supported the stock prices of listed companies.
The Eastern Securities Research also estimates that, based on the expected stock buybacks from A stock listings as a whole since the beginning of the year, and on the average value of the stock that has been repurchased, it is expected that this year's equity buy-back will generate an increase of $150 billion in the A stock market.
During the last two months, the restoration of the Qur'an Monument, a large-scale mural of the post-Tianjin Palace by the national focal point, was concluded on 26 months, and will be reopened during this year's national holiday.
The Qur'an Map is a large, traditional mural that reflects Mother's life in its entirety.
With the approval of the State authorities, it was created from 1991 to 1994 by the Director of the former Civil Museum of Tianjin (the Queen's Palace).
It is known that the mural was painted on the south and north walls of the Queen's Palace, 32 metres long and 2.6 metres tall, in two parts, with more than 30 stories of the birth of the Queen, the crossing of the sea, the plume and so on, and 358 people rediscovering the life of their mother.
Tianjin's summer rains and dry winters in recent years led to the “dryness” of the mural, which accounted for 60 per cent of the total mural area.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of the mother's ancestors, the Council of Antiquities Streets and the Queen's Palace in the South Kaikian District of Tianjin city started work on the restoration of murals in and around the Queen's Palace.
The restoration work was led by Chai Chang-kyu, with the participation of four prominent national painters.
The restoration work was based on the principle of “renovation as old as the old” and, at the same time, partially adapted the original mural, which was supplemented where the mural had not been perfect.
In the process of repair, we have also made innovations and attempts in colours, materials, pen ink, etc.
The original mural style, spirituality, spirituality and art style was maintained after restoration.
The Palace of Queens was established in 1326. It is known as the Queens Palace and has undergone numerous renovations. It is one of the oldest buildings in the city of Tianjin and one of the oldest temples in China.
On 25 September, the launch ceremony of the Beijing Daesing International Airport was crowned.
The stylish plaque of the Beijing Da Hing International Airport terminal, called "The Phoenix's wings" is the first of the seven wonders of the new world.
At present, Beijing Capital International Airport is overstretched, carrying 100 million passengers last year, becoming the second year of the world after Atlanta Airport in the United States of America, where passengers have swallowed up hundreds of millions of times.
By 2022, Beijing Daesing International Airport is expected to have 45 million passengers and 20 per cent of international flights; by 2025, 72 million passengers are expected to have swallowed up and 30 per cent of international flights are expected.
How cool is it when it comes to the new country?
Beijing Dae-hing International Airport, located between Beijing City and Guangyang City, Hebei Province, is 46 kilometres from the Tiananmen Gate line and is currently the largest new airport to be built around the world.
The surface projection of the steel structure on the roof of its terminal amounted to 180,000 square metres, with 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daesing International Airport is the world’s first air terminal with two levels of arrival and two levels of departure – F1-F4 international, domestic, domestic, and international.
The two-storey bridges that connect the high-speed and the airport from outside the terminal correspond to the F3 and F4 terminals, respectively – international departures to the floor and domestic departures to the two floors.
The first flight of the Beijing Daesing International Airport opened the era of Beijing's “double airport”.
The new airport has been established as a large international air hub, a new power source for the country, and an integrated regional traffic hub in Kyung Jinsha, which is supporting the construction of the new area of Yu An. To date, a total of 66 airlines, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong, Adota and foreign airlines, are interested in entering Dahin International Airport in Beijing, and flights are being approved from time to time.
During the winter and spring season of 2019, Beijing Daesing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, of which 101 are internal and 15 are international; it covers 112 points worldwide, including 97 national and 15 international.
This has resulted in a well-developed, well-competitive and internationally competitive “two-hub” airport configuration with the capital's international airport, which has eased the operational pressure on the capital's saturated airport capacity and better met the urgent need for rapid growth in air transport in and around Beijing and has effectively enhanced the international competitiveness of our civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daesing International Airport takes due account of its geographical location, its relationship to the surrounding airspace and operating environment. For the first time in the country, the airport runways have adopted a “all-way” layout, the world's largest automated air traffic management system and the establishment of China's largest terminal control area, which will maximize the efficiency of aviation operations.
For the first time at airports of this size in the country, a nationalized baggage processing and information management system has been used to improve the efficiency of baggage processing using innovative baggage transfer models.
The launch of the Beijing Da Hing International Airport augurs well for the phoenix.
This new airport, which has created more than 40 international, domestic and national first, with a national production rate of more than 98 per cent, is bound to have a direct and indirect economic impact on the surrounding industries and to inject a vibrant dynamism into the economic development of Beijing.
Marv is scheduled to hold a congress in November, to be transferred to the Party until the age of 16.
A central congress is tentatively scheduled to be held in early November, with the intention of amending the party charter to be transferred to the party until the age of 16.
With the adoption by Congress of a downward revision of the voting age for general elections, Mawar announced that the 66th Central Congress would be held this year, with proposals to amend the party charter, including a downward adjustment of the membership age of Mawar to 16 years from the current 18-year-old age.
The President of the General Assembly, Mr. Dato'Seri Wei, said that the Central Committee had been scheduled for 2 and 3 November of this year, but that the date of the Congress might change as a result of the by-election of the Danish-Ai seat.
He said that, as the Electoral Commission would meet on 1 October to finalize the nomination of the Danfumi State seat by-election and the polling day, they would meet the following day, 2 October, to discuss whether to change the date of this year's Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of the Central Committee convened yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the congress and to amend the party's statutes, but only to coincide with the tragic death of Congressman Danjumpi of the Indigenous Unity Party, Dato'Mohamud, and thus to join the agenda of the State's by-elections.
Xinhua Network
Wang Guoxiang, who was born in February 1943, worked in 1967 and served successively as secretary of the Commune Party, county committee secretary, mayor, etc.
In 1986, Wang was the secretary of the county council of Shandong Province, which was a poor district in the province.
During the five years of his tenure, Mr. Wang focused his efforts on three things: the promotion of vegetable industrialization; the development of a salty salt beach; and the laying of the foundations for an industrial turn, which led to the emergence of a pocket and a build-up of the waist.
Life farmers have a tradition of vegetables and have learned the lessons of growing them.
In the early 1980s, subsistence farmers were unable to sell their harvests and rot in the ground.
The Wang Bo-xiang study found that the key to catching vegetables is to make the flow good.
Lifelight was the first to establish a wholesale market for vegetables and to set the stage for the development of a market economy.
Party cadres have to take the lead, screw up, and all the lost county has to take care of.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Bo-xiang, 17 members of the three-dollar village, Lo-yee Wang, built 17 warm winter vegetables sheds, and 17 “two million households” emerged from the village in that year.
This was followed by the establishment of outreach teams in the county, which, with the mobilization of Wang Bo-xiang, directed Wang Lo-yi to the communes; over 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted in the first year, and the vegetable sheds moved to the county and to the country as a whole.
For hundreds of years, 1.6 million acres of land have been painted on shallow beaches in addition to saline beaches.
The local population is living in very difficult conditions.
Soo-nam's got a vegetable shed. What about Su-bei?
Wang Bo-xiang organized a war of congress for 100,000 people and set up camps on the desolate beaches for 40 or 50 days.
Wang Bo-xiang and the county's leaders live and live on the site, pushing cars and loads like private workers, eating and sleeping, and the people see them stretching their thumbs, admiring their eyes... At that time, Subei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a “pound pot” on salty beaches.
In July 1986, Wang Bo-xiang participated for the first time as county secretary in the industrial conference of the city.
During the meeting, a “Comparative table of industrial economy figures in the 12 counties of the city” was released, which at first glance shows the value of industrial output, which is still in its fourth place.
However, if the original salt is removed, a mere $119 million in pure industrial output remains in the third lowest position.
Wang Xiang, with more than 70 men, went to the field to “change his mind”.
Less than a year later, the county invested $150 million in 77 projects.
Every year since then, we have organized a "creaking mission" to Shenzhen, Dongjung and Shanghai.
There is a shortage of businesses and a shortage of entrepreneurs.
Wang Bo-xiang presided over the thematic meeting: 40 “careful and talented” leaders were chosen publicly throughout the county and placed on the industrial front.
In 1991, he joined the ranks of the country's top 100 counties, and Wang Bo-xiang was transferred as Deputy Mayor of the city.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 businesses, and more than 100,000 “million-dollar households,” a cadre recognized by the people. The people of the village still call him “our uncle’s secretary.”
On 26 September, local time, the Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African States members of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Côte d'Ivoire, which is currently a member of the Council in Africa, Oyono of Equatorial Guinea, Pandor of South Africa, and Kara of Niger, which is a member-designate of the Council, and Jehinawi of Tunisia, attended the meeting.
Wang Ying made four proposals to strengthen cooperation between the two sides in the Council.
First, we are united in strength.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation was unilateralism, the direct consequence of which was the challenge to the basic norms of international relations and the impact on the role of the United Nations, to the detriment of the interests of the vast majority of developing countries, including African countries, and small and medium-sized States.
Meeting this challenge requires the strength of solidarity by hand and shoulder.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, focusing not just on three votes, but on the African continent as a whole.
Together, China and Africa will not be just four votes, but will lead others to follow up, influence and shape the Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a “3+1” coordination mechanism with African members of the Council, which needs to be fully utilized.
Secondly, we rely on consultations to resolve disputes.
China has always advocated a political solution to hotspot issues. Africa has a good tradition of consultation, as well as the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex and difficult issues on the Council's agenda, particularly hotspots in Africa, are mostly the root causes of colonialism and, in some cases, are directly related to external factors.
Together, we want to use Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations to play the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation, etc.
Thirdly, self-sustainability.
African countries and peoples know best about Africa's problems, and Africa has the capacity and the wisdom to solve its own problems.
In addressing Africa's hotspots, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa's will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with the African side and to resolutely promote capacity-building for African-owned peace operations.
Fourthly, development is fundamental.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we will insist on putting economic and social development first and supporting each other in their chosen path of development.
China is ready to build a “one-way” with the AU Agenda 2063, the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 and the development strategies of African countries, and to help African countries to strengthen their capacity for development and to address the root causes of conflict.
Together, we want to promote greater United Nations investment in Africa's development.
With the resurgence of the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China has done and will continue to do its utmost to provide the necessary human and material assistance and is ready to coordinate its efforts with African countries to mobilize greater assistance from the United Nations and WHO and to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Relays such as the Neonatal Unit save small lives.
It's dangerous!
The pregnant mother had an early pregnancy and, on her way to the hospital in a panic, a 32-week premature baby could not wait for her to be born on her father's sidecar.
Fortunately, obstetric and neonatal doctors handled it in a timely manner, and the relay saved the small life.
On 19, 20 and 21 days, the maternity and neonatal units of the maternal and child health centre in Hubei province received three premature births on their way for three consecutive days, while the other two were born in 120 first aid vehicles, all of which were for 29 weeks.
Ms. Cheng was a second-born mother and, at 7 a.m. on 19 September, she had a stomach ache, thinking that she had 32 weeks of pregnancy and that the first birth was premature, and she had packed the waiting items and was ready to take a bath and go directly to the hospital.
After 0930 hours, Ms. Cheng packed up and asked her husband to drive from Xu Dong's home to the hospital.
It was not expected that soon after the car had opened, the baby could not wait for her to be born on her father's sidekick.
After 20 minutes, Ms. Cheng and the baby finally arrived at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Building at the Maternal and Child Health Home in Hubei Province.
The hospital security officers saw the upset couple and the baby and immediately informed the maternity ward that the four doctors and midwife Liu Yanyan, who were waiting for the deputy doctor, were carrying the delivery bag and the umbilical cord drive, were going down the stairs.
“At that time, the mother was half lying on the side of the car, under the water of sheep and blood, and a baby boy was next to her, with a umbilical cord attached.”
He was asked by Zhang Qing to learn that the baby was a 32-week premature birth, that the parents had not been able to cover the children on their way, that the early autumn morning had been cold, that his skin was cold, that he was not crying and that his limbs were weak.
Yoo Ying-hyang quickly went to the co-pilot to deal with the baby's umbilical cord, and Zhang Qing came in from the cab, quickly opened the delivery bag, covered the child with a couple of layers of tissues and a package, and cleaned the respirator (e.g. map) for the newborn, and then carried the baby to the 12th floor neonatal section.
Upon receipt of the information, the neonatal doctor arrived at the nurse's station to rescue the premature baby.
At that time, the baby had a purple face and a lack of oxygen was suffocated, and the doctor gave him a pipe intubation immediately. Less than a minute later, the baby recovered its heartbeat, the skin color gradually recovered and the recovery was successful.
Upon admission, this 32-week baby was placed with a trauma respirator, sustained rescue and smooth breathing, and successfully evacuated the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby's vital signs are currently stable and breathing well, and a small amount of breastfeeding has begun.
Coincidentally, on 19, 20 and 21 days, the maternity and neonatal units of the Institute received three premature births on their way for three consecutive days, while the other two were born in 120 first aid vehicles, all of which were 29 weeks old and are currently actively treating them.
Mr. Sun Guoqiang, Director of Obstetrics at the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Centre, explained that, in recent years, women and children in the province had attended to a large number of babies born on the subway in private cars, a situation which might threaten the lives of their mothers and children.
Director Sun warned that pregnant mothers should visit the hospital as soon as they suffered abdominal pain, broken water, and so on.
In the event that the child is present at home or on the road, the mother shall try to be in a flat bed, with blankets on her buttocks, etc., in order to prevent the baby from falling back into the ground, the child shall be kept warm as soon as the child is present and shall be brought to medical attention as soon as possible.
The newer Aerial Technology Company is officially operational.
The establishment of VSTEA was a fine-tuning part of the memorandum of cooperation signed in April 2018 between VAECO and ST Engineering Aerospace, marking the emergence of the first Vietnamese aircraft equipment maintenance and repair consortium.
Two leading aviation technology companies in Viet Nam and Singapore cooperate to provide aircraft equipment maintenance and repair services to national and international airlines.
Vietnam’s general manager, Yang Zhisheng, said that the company’s associate, ST Engineering Aerospace, was the largest and highest-level aircraft maintenance group in the world.
It is believed that this cooperation will bring benefits to both sides and that it will be the beginning of a promising future of cooperation between the two sides.
Lim Serh Ghee, the Managing Director of ST Engineering Aerospace, stated that the sharing of extensive experience with ST Engineering would help the consortium to provide international-level maintenance and repair services and contribute to the flight safety of the airlines.
The birth of VSTEA contributed to a deep and wide-ranging approach to the market for the maintenance and repair of aircraft equipment with the potential to excavate.
At the same time, there is an excellent opportunity to access modern technology and to train senior aviation technicians.
To better meet the sustainable development needs of Viet Nam's aviation industry.
Research shows that manufacturing has become the focus of attention in major countries around the world - Xinhuanet

Three points a ball?
On 27 Beijing time, the NBA Development Alliance announced a pilot new penalty, with only one penalty at a time, the value of which would be determined by irregularities.
O'Neill has a very low penalty rate in the NBA.
The new regulation provides for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points and 3 points for 3 points for 3 points for 3 points for offenders and 1 point for 1 point for 1 point for 1 point for offences.
The last two minutes of regular time and the extra time competition follow the previous penalty rule.
While this new season is only being tested by the NBA Development Alliance, fans are more concerned about the implications for current players if it is introduced in the NBA.
For the time being, many believe that the new rules may be in favour of Hadden the Bigbeard, and that James, who is less than fine, is going to suffer.
Wuhan's promotion of industrial intelligence has given up to $20 million in subsidies.
On 27 September, journalists learned from a series of city launches organized by the Vuhan City Press Office of the “Present to the New China Games” that, since this year, the city has accelerated its industrial intellectual transformation and implemented a transformational subsidy of up to 20 million yuan.
To date, more than 800 industrial enterprises of more than size have collected information on their intellectual transformation needs.
Mr. Zhang Hong, Deputy Director-General of the Economics and Informatization Department of Wuhan City, introduced an action plan for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises starting this year, providing free advisory diagnostic services and solutions to industrial enterprises of higher size than demand, and promoting a new round of technological upgrading of high-level enterprises in all its aspects.
In accordance with the plan, the city of Wuhan publicly selects a number of specialized diagnostic services each year to carry out a needs-based smart transformation survey for all industrial enterprises of the size of the city and above, by means of special columns, questionnaires and reports.
To date, information has been collected on the intellectual transformation needs of more than 800 regulated industrial enterprises, accounting for nearly one third of all industrial enterprises in the city as a whole and above.
Five municipal diagnostic platforms have organized teams to be placed in enterprises to conduct “one-on-one” field assessments and programme validations.
Zhang Hong reported that the city was currently organizing 373 smart transformation projects, with a total investment of $29,760 million, and that the leading intelligent workshops and intelligent factories in such industries as the 5G Smart Production Line, the Motorola National Lead Smart Cellular Production Line, the Vuhan Siemens Sub transformer Digitally Unmanned Plant, the National First Quantified Satellite Production Line for Space Industries, the New Veterinary Intelligent Production Line for Resurging the Bioworld, and the European Intelligents Networked Smart Production Line had been set in motion.
In addition, the city of Wuhan has increased its financial support for smart transformation projects.
These include investment in industrial enterprises that are intelligently modified and actually completed; investment in equipment hardware, and soft investment in research and development, which is granted at 8 per cent, up to $20 million in conversion subsidies.
At the same time, financial institutions such as the Active Joint Exchange and the Wuhan Branch of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry provide individualized financial services tailored to the intellectual transformation of industrial enterprises, thus significantly easing the pressure on enterprise financing.
Trudeau, "Putting Man down," can he be re-elected?
This time, Trudeau tripped out of the big pit, and it was Trudeau himself that dug up a little bit.
In recent days, the Canadian media have exposed several old pictures of the current Prime Minister, Trudeau, in which Trudeau dressed himself as a black person.
This is considered to be a clear act of racial discrimination, triggering a wave of violence in Canada.
After what happened, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians do not buy much.
Trudeau sort of moved a rock and smashed his own foot.
As political critic Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the “anti-Black Face Movement” in the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profile in accusing opposition parties or dissidents within the party of “substantial losses” in this regard, and have repeatedly stated that “anyone who makes such a mistake should be dismissed immediately.”
Simply put, this time, Trudo tripped out of the big pit, and it was Trudo himself that dug up a little bit.
Trudo, the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudo of Canada, is young and handsome and, when he first came out, he was struck by a cyclone of “political idols”.
Formerly “politically” he, after taking the lead of the Federal Liberal Party, fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the Canadian federal legislative elections of 2015 – the Federal Liberal Party, half of which sits in the Federal House of Commons, gained valuable separate governmental power.
At that time, Trudeau put forward a number of political platforms, concepts, such as “ethnicity and gender equality”, “eco-environmental environment”, “economic revitalization”, and emphasis on the eradication of corruption and “irregular winds”.
However, for five years in office, he had been “high and low” in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
In terms of “ethnicity and gender equality”, leaving aside the “black-face” incident, he “doesn’t speak for himself” on a range of Aboriginal issues, which led First Nations groups, leaders, to move protest tents to the gates of the Hills of Congress on the 150th anniversary of Canada’s founding.
With regard to the fight against corruption, at the beginning of last year, Trudo was involved in the boiling “Ranving” incident.
He was exposed to major irregularities by his home construction and engineering company, Ran Wanling, and pressured the authorities and officials in charge of the investigation to demand that the latter be “high-valued”.
Moreover, Trudeau, after the big deal, was angry at the disclosure officer, Wang Chaudhry, who was the first to disclose the malpractice, when he was the Attorney-General of Canada.
Although the case itself remains questionable, it is difficult to erase the suspicion.
Many observers have pointed out that the collapse of the Trudeau regime for five years was largely the result of its own “powdering pits”, the largest of which were the three “drawn by itself” and the “better by itself” and the “better by the law”.
The most authoritative Angus-Reed poll data in Canada show that, from 2015 to the present, those supporting Trudeau slipped from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent, while those opposing it jumped from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Although other opposition parties and their party leaders have performed similarly poorly, even a significant proportion of voters who still wish to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now not convinced that the Federation Prime Minister, the head of the ruling party, is the same.
On 21 October, when the new Canadian federal legislative elections are about to begin, will Trudeau be able to repeat what he won five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficulty.
Both at the level of enterprise competition and consumer experience, as well as at the level of regional aviation integration and the development of the integration dimension of Kyoto, have far-reaching and positive implications.
On 25 September, Beijing Daesing International Airport was officially launched.
Reporters from the New Kyoto newspaper were informed by the Beijing Municipal Development and Rehabilitation Board that the capital airport was operating in a state of oversaturation and that the opening of the airport would enhance the capacity of the capital's air services.
Following Shanghai, Beijing became the second city with two airports in our common city, similar to Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport, which serves mainly domestic aviation services, and Pudong Airport, which is dominated by international shipping, which will also provide a more disaggregated service based on differences in service to different national and international air operations in the future.
The expansion of Da Hing Airport has had a more beneficial impact on the capital airport from the point of view of its operational development.
The capital airport reached 100 million passengers in 2018 and is the country's largest in terms of traffic, but there is still a significant shortfall in capacity compared to the rapidly growing demand for operations, especially for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers, travel, etc., and to respond to the growing trend towards open and internationally integrated cities in Beijing, Dae-Hing International Airport has been established as a large international hub airport, with plans to meet 100 million annual passengers and 4 million tons of mail and mail traffic in the future.
As a result, there is no overlap in the positioning of the two airports, targeting different client groups and having sufficient market space.
At the economic and financial levels, it is clear that the navigation of the International Airport will have a win-win effect by easing tensions in air transport in Beijing, accelerating the rate of passenger and cargo throughput and building incremental cakes for the two-nuclear operation of the capital.
From a user's point of view, as the international airport moves through the capital, it is not necessary to concentrate all future trips on the capital airport. It can also reduce a number of problems associated with the excessive concentration of routes, such as longer stop security, slower boarding of passengers, indirectly increasing the length of aircraft and passengers'stay at the airport, increasing the burden of airport operations, reduced shipping through the capital airport and, in fact, improved passenger travel experience.
According to media estimates of the time and cost of various transport routes to large international airports, such as travelling directly to Da Hing airport on the Kiyotung highway from the South 5th Ring and driving in 50 minutes, the gas money will be around $40 and the high-speed fee will be $15, while the orbital transport metro airport line will be selected for a distance of 20 km and 30 km, with fares of $10, $25 and $35; citizens can also travel between Beijing West Station and the Da Hing airport station for more than 20 minutes.
In general, there are a wide range of transport options available for citizens to go to Da Hing airport, within a reasonable range of costs and time.
From the point of view of trends, Da Hing airport is located as a traffic hub in Kyotsu and is therefore a little further away from Beijing, but has increased radiation exposure to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitating more people to travel, and has significant implications for the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers will be able to benefit from the increased international air route service provided by Da Hing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning at Da Hing Airport.
In addition to the new airport line in the city of Beijing, which leads directly to the airport, there are several highways linking the airport to the surrounding area.
Just as urban passengers in Guangdong Dongdong, Fushan, Kiang and other cities can travel to Bai Yun Airport in Guangzhou via the Guangzhou Highway, residents of such places as the Beijing Ribbon and the Yu Anjin District will also benefit from the Great Euphoria Airport, which will provide easy and efficient air services.
As can be seen, the opening of Dahin International Airport has far-reaching and positive implications, not only for the long-term layout and development of the shipping industry in Beijing, but also for the diversification of options for the movement of a large number of residents in Kyoto, as well as for the further improvement of the quality of services provided by the shipping industry in Beijing, which is more conducive to the integrated development process in Kyoto and to the economic and trade development of the area surrounding the airport.
Therefore, with regard to the opening of the airport, we need to make an economic score not only for the individual, but also for the overall development.
On the 27th of mid-day, the tiles rose by 1.46 % - Xinhuanet
On September 27, Xinhua's Shenzhen electricity (journalist Zhao Rish) moved high on the mid-point finger on the 27th, with a final collection of 6077.23 points, an increase of 87.55 points, or 1.46 per cent, over the previous trading day.
On that day, the sum of $108 billion was paid, which is $31.9 billion less than on the previous trading day.
Of the stocks traded on the same day, 668 were closed and 668 were closed and 15 were closed, while 222 were closed and four were cut off, including the shares of Xiaowei; and the shares of Xingxing were flattened by 40.
In 2019, the Forum on Economic and Social Issues of Viet Nam was held in the province of Suntsun
The Vice-President of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Viet Nam, Nguyen Dejeng, revealed that, at the beginning of the year, Viet Nam's economic and social development had seen many new developments and continued growth.
The forum focused on economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, participants had an in-depth exchange of views and views on four themes, namely, economic development in 2019 and the impact of selected FTAs, outstanding issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019, outstanding issues in the Vietnamese socio-cultural context in 2019, and projections and recommendations for the socio-economic development of Viet Nam in 2020.
There was general agreement that global economic growth slowed in the first months of 2019 and that risks and challenges increased.
Trade frictions among the major economies have further reduced global trade and investment.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite the uncertainty of the global economy, in which 70 per cent of the world's economies have stagnated in growth, Viet Nam's economic development has achieved many promising results, with stable macroeconomic performance and effective control of inflation, with an average consumer price index growth of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, the lowest in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but the increase remained high compared to the same period in 2011-2017.
In forecasting trends in Viet Nam's economic development from 2019 to 2020, the Deputy Director of Viet Nam's National Economic and Social Forecasting Centre, Dundeyn, stated that the Vietnamese economy had shown a high growth momentum in 2019 against the backdrop of the turmoil in the world economy.
By 2020, Viet Nam's macroeconomic stability was expected to remain generally stable, the implementation of trade-related agreements would contribute to trade development, the restructuring of the economy and the improvement of the business environment were further strengthened, and Viet Nam's external export activities were expected to decline as a result of trade frictions.
There is therefore a need to strengthen early warning mechanisms for monitoring forecasts, to proactively seek trade relief measures for Viet Nam's exports, to find opportunities to expand new export markets and to facilitate the export of various commodities, including agricultural and water products.
At the same time, inflation has been kept at a reasonable level, thereby contributing to the development of ancillary industries and supporting the development of high-tech, organic and ecological agriculture.
Liu Ji Jie, Director of the Consular Office in Siem Reap, Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, hosted a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Liu Jijie said that, 70 years after the establishment of the new China, China has actively participated in international affairs and contributed more to China's intellectual and Chinese programmes to improve global economic governance and promote common global development, making important contributions to world peace and development and bringing tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and the well-being of its people.
Liu Jijie explained that, as the world's second largest economy, China contributed more than 30 per cent to world economic growth, in particular to China's “one-way” initiative, and that cooperation between China's local provinces and cities and the provinces of Siem Reap and Siem Reap was deepening.
He said that this year marked the beginning of 61 years of Chinese-Cambodian relations, with fraternal friendships between the two countries, and that mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Cambodia would be the driving force behind the local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap Province, Dishiah, highly commended the great achievements of the new China over the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries on the results of their friendly cooperation.
It looks forward to continued joint efforts between the two sides to promote Chinese-Chinese friendship and cooperation, to strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit and to continuously improve the living standards of the people.
According to Desaikha, Siem Reap Province has had remarkable relations with China's provinces and cities, and has so far entered into friendly relations with China's 28 provinces and cities. The large cultural performance projects, "Uggrea" and "Ug Go Dynasty" have landed. The Siem Reap-Gangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Siem Reap New International Airport Project, the Siem Rey Pagoda Special Training Course for Government Officials, the Siem Retro Study Scholarship for Siem Rey Sons, rural consultations, the re-engineering of urban roads and the Cataract Restoration Public Service Project, which has benefited directly from the cooperation between Cambodia and Cambodia.
The reception was attended by the Minister of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Ken Wensson, the President of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the Governor of the 5 provinces in the region, the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Council, volunteer teachers, the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce, representatives of Chinese companies and representatives of the foreign Siem Reap corps.
"The Ten Years of Digital China" - Xinhuanet
If the 2009 local website forum were to be used as a starting point, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Conference in Hangzhou had been held for a full decade.
From the concept of “in the clouds” to the practice of “in the clouds”, big data and cloud computing became one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management and public services over a period of 10 years.
At the Jinhai Shining Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Heining, Zhejiang, there have recently been a number of new “colleagues” next to the Quality Inspector with AI intelligence.
It is open for 24 hours, is identified at more than twice the rate of manual labour, and the accuracy of the quality check is stable at more than 95 per cent.
According to the head of the company, the “quality examiner” with the camera has focused on more than 40,000 defective samples, which, with the cloud computing power behind it, can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages, with defective battery fragments classified.
This enterprise is only a microcosm of today's cloud computing assistive manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Informatics published the Guide to Promoting the Implementation of Corporate Clouds (2018-2020), which aims to achieve, by 2020, a significant increase in the awareness and motivation of enterprises and a significant increase in the proportion and depth of applications.
According to King Ken, founder of Aryanun, data-centred cloud computing today has opened the way for data to bridge the digital economy of key elements.
At the same time, our cloud computing industry has grown in size over the past 10 years.
The White Paper on cloud computing development (2019), published by the China Institute of Information and Communication Research in July of this year, showed that the total market size of the Chinese cloud computing in 2018 was 96.28 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2 per cent over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology that underpins industrial transformation and digital economic development, invisible “clouds” have unwittingly transformed urban governance and social life.
At this year's cloud-dwelling conference, the “city brain” of three years in a row continues to be a cause for concern.
The Aliun side described that the urban brain has now become the hub of urban governance from a traffic governance tool, and that the relevant collaborative application has been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain achieves new urban management service functions such as “busting before paying” “real-time perception of the number of clients”, “tourism route design”, through a strong computing capability.
In the area of government services, “one thing” is being replaced by “one cloud”, which combines “one thing” with “one thing”, and cloud computing facilitates the supply of government services on both sides.
Zhejiang has now established a unified public data platform throughout the province through the political upkeep of Zhejiang.
As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million corporate entities in the province, bringing together 3066 categories of 19.8 billion data.
On average, 12 million monthly calls have been made and shared between government departments in Zhejiang province, and every time the data is called on a cloud, it may mean that people are less likely to run their jobs.
Makoto makes tea with a plastic tea bag!
According to the Central News Agency, a recent study in Canada recently found that a bag of plastic tea bags could release billions or even billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than a single person's estimated entire intake of microplastics, but to date there is no evidence that ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
Researchers at McGill University in Canada have reportedly found that immersing plastic tea bags in a glass of almost boiling hot water (95°C), will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the total estimated amount of microplastics taken by a person.
According to studies published earlier in 2019, the general population eats at least 50,000 plastic particles per year, while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
According to the information received, the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea packages at Montreux Shops and Cafés, opened the tea bags, washed them and dipped them into almost boiling water for five minutes, and analysed them using electronic microscopes and spectroscopy.
According to this study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, “in several stages more than the plastic load of other previous foods”.
It has been reported that most tea bags are made of natural fibres, but many brands made of natural fibres still use plastic to seal them.
Some branded tea bags are no longer paper-based and instead use plastics, which are the subject of tests by researchers.
Plastic particles are microscopic fragments of plastic, which researchers define as being in the range of 100 nm to 5 m2 and are mainly produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deep-sea trenches around the world, and these microplastics can be found in running water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
For the first time in October 2018, researchers found plastic particles in human excreta samples from several countries in different regions of the world.
In order to test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea packs, the Canadian research team placed daphnia in contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behaviour of these daphnia and led to developmental malformations.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, WHO notes that more research is needed to understand fully how these plastics spread into the environment and how they affect humans.
Researchers speculate that the large amount of plastic particles released from these tea bags may be due to their exposure to boiling water and the possibility of decomposition or osmosis of toxic substances even when “food grade” plastics are heated up to more than 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres stated that climate emergencies were the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster erodes a generation of human development gains.
This has been illustrated by the hurricanes that have struck Papua, Dominica and the Bahamas since this year.
About one quarter of the population of small island developing States lives at an altitude of 5 metres or less.
The relocation may seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island developing States are jointly committed to achieving carbon neutrality and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030, thus once again leading the world in the right direction.
According to Guterres, “the climate crisis is accumulating new injustices over old ones.
Although the contribution of small island developing States to global warming has been small, it has paid the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are caught in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and the time has come to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States.”
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transform renewable energy sources; and urging international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly highly indebted middle-income countries, to access financing.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the lifeline of the planet — the oceans.
The latest special report issued this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered from the severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, it is likely that there will be some extreme sea level rise in many regions every year that would have occurred only once a century ago.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.
The costs of pollution, overfishing and acidification are enormous.
Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic contamination has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decline in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high transport, energy and infrastructure costs.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, subjecting them to price fluctuations.
Some States are also making efforts to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
According to Guterres, “the problem can be solved anywhere by resolving it in the most challenging environment.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that the world can draw upon.”
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India indicated that the financial system was sufficiently mobile.
India's finance minister, Seetalaman, 26, stated that the current financial system was sufficiently liquid and that India's economic growth was expected to recover during the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday demand.
The above statement was made after a meeting with representatives of private Indian banks, non-banking financial institutions, housing banks, etc.
Seetalaman does not state the relevance of these statements.
Some of the former Indian and overseas media have attributed the sustained slowdown in the Indian economy to the liquidity constraints of non-bank financial institutions.
The decline in car sales was cited by Seetalaman, who denied that liquidity constraints were the main cause of the decline in sales.
According to Seetalaman, the decline in automobile sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
Seetalaman predicted that India's economic growth could recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
India's annual shopping season began in September and will continue until the end of the year.
The market anticipates that shopping consumption will contribute significantly to economic growth in India.
The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education has recently issued a circular on the prohibition of non-compliance by primary and secondary schools throughout the province during the National Day Leave and will organize unannounced visits by personnel at random.
In its circular on the prohibition of the use of state holidays to supplement classes, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education stressed the need for primary and secondary schools throughout the country to ensure that, during the celebration of the National Day, no students are allowed to organize group remedial classes or new classes, no students are allowed to organize courses in the fields of study, long courses, Osai classes, interest classes, higher classes, etc., and that no school premises or school premises are rented to other educational institutions for the conduct of training courses of all kinds.
At the same time, in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from organizing, advising and inducing students to attend in- and out-of-school remedial classes; in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from attending out-of-school training institutions or from attending remedial classes organized by other teachers, parents, parents'committees, etc.; and in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from introducing and providing information to out-of-school training institutions and others.
The circular makes it clear that in the case of confirmed violations of remedial measures in primary and secondary schools, the local education administration will increase the deductions in the examination of quality development education at the district level in the same year, and that teachers involved in remedial violations will be dealt with in a serious manner in accordance with the relevant provisions of the teacher-student style.
Support for pig production, market supply.
Our loyalty requires that measures be taken in six areas.
A telephonic conference was held today to follow up on the policy measures taken by the Central and Provincial Councils and the Provincial Government to support the production of raw pigs and to secure the supply of the market.
There is a need for loyalty and for the implementation of measures for the production of raw pigs in six areas.
The mayor of the “basket of food” is responsible for its implementation, and this year 45 million registered pigs throughout the province have been separated into the municipalities and included in the accountability test.
Implementation of policy measures to effectively address the “last kilometre” of policy implementation.
The production of pig-rich pigs is being implemented, the policy of subsidizing them is being carefully implemented, the growth of pig-growing enterprises is being encouraged, and there is a systematic selection of good female pigs from the group of commodity pigs.
In order to secure the financing, it is important to ensure that large farming enterprises that are not yet well-known in our province have access to them as a top priority.
The implementation of market circulation systems has accelerated the construction of cold-chain logistics facilities for raw pigs and has contributed to the overall shift from “pigs” to “meats”.
The implementation of the modern system of immunization is ensured with the deployment of grass-roots quarantine personnel appropriate to the scale of farming and work tasks, and the first line of protection against disease and disease is secured.
Be faithful and do everything possible to guarantee the supply of the meat market, to ensure that there are no large-scale shortages and large-scale disruptions, and to ensure a stable supply of pork for major holidays.
It also deployed efforts to maintain the control and control of the African swine plague, the ban on retreats in key waters of my Governor's river basin, and the acquisition of medium-to-late rice throughout the province.
We're talking about the motherland, the nation's soul, the old Shanghai letters, the big white rabbits, taking classes for college students.
The "Me and My Fatherland" campus has made college students feel happy about it.
On the occasion of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, four famous Shanghai Old Letters have gathered on 27th of the 27th day of the Shanghai Polytechnic University of China, four Shanghai Old Letters representing an average of more than 90 years of history, and more than 200 young scholars have spoken about their country and their nation's spirits.
An exhibition of the old branded products on the scene.
The talk in the classroom made the students wonder that the display of the old branded product was carefully placed outside the classroom, and that the "Me and My Fatherland" campus had a punctuation point for the students.
Big rabbit lip cream, big white rabbit ice cream... as an old-word brand, big rabbit milk candy has been active in recent years, aggressive, innovating and cross-bordering.
The big white rabbit, born in 1959, happens to be on its 60th birthday this year.
She also looks at youth consumption groups.
Wang Weiji, secretary-general and deputy director-general of the party branch of the Shanghai Salmon Food Company Ltd., referred to the scene of “Spring with abalone, summer with hot fish, autumn with blizzards with brittle shrimp and winter with brittle crabs” as a reflection of people's constant innovation in “eating”.
Companies have also further developed branding culture in terms of taste innovation, caricature packaging design, etc., to adapt to the heritage of younger consumer groups.
The old word represents a presentation of the path of innovation on the scene of the Art Party.
The manager of Shanghai Feathers Co. Ltd., Yuji, agreed that, “All innovations are based on solid foundations, and the old word is a thin-haired process.
Each and every one of us has a hidden expectation of the old word.
At the heart of the product, the age of small and beautiful should begin."
As one of the country's first “old Chinese” characters, Shanghai Feathers also quickly adapted to market trends, upgraded brands visually, introduced professional business teams and achieved a significant increase in turnover.
“The old word mark is not only visible in such traditional channels as supermarkets, but it is now also active in new retailing and activities.
All our changes, in the end, will have to achieve the goal that consumers will be able to see, hear, and, in the end, buy."
Uyang Jae Ling, Deputy General Manager of Soap (Group) Ltd., Shanghai, said.
In the future, Shanghai soap production will also continue its high-end development and the systematic development of energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products that are promising and satisfactory to users, following a high-tech and cost-effective path.
As a result of this art party class, the students were well-received.
I grew up with the old word, with the good memories and emotions of my childhood."
Mr. Song Yuen is sighing.
The Shanghai Old Letter represents the story of the motherland and the national soul of over 200 young students.
Chou Xianxing said that how to tap into brand culture so that high-quality traditional culture can be inherited and flourished is an issue that we, as design students, need to think about and explore.
Building on the “Shanghai Image” project of Tin Wei, Dean of the School of Arts of the University of Technology in Huadong, and Prof. Niyang's “Old Words Incorporated Brand Innovative Studio”, the Party's course aims to deepen the cultural potential and modern commercial value of the Old Words, using their competitiveness and influence to enhance the concentration of cultural radioactivity of the Old Words in Shanghai to achieve the industrial effect of “1+1>2” in the form of “design + culture” and to present Shanghai culture from a new perspective.
According to the information received, the Arts Party class will also continue to invite literaryists, painting masters, pottery masters, non-herding masters, architects and landscape masters to serve as lecturers, through which they tell stories of innovation and adherence to Chinese culture, highlight the characteristics of the times, strengthen the ideals of university students, foster their love for their country, speak with their works, make their works sound, innovate in the form of party classes, teach subjects that students love, enhance their intellectual, theoretical and affinity and relevance, enhance the inflammability of their party classes, and develop new generations capable of national renewal!
Abe made a video to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
On 26 local time, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan congratulated the People's Republic of China by video on its seventieth anniversary.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, I'm Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend warm congratulations to the Government and people of Japan.
At the G20 Osaka Summit in June, China and China declared to the world the firm will of the G20 through the G20 Leaders Osaka Summit Declaration to make it a success.
In addition, at the Japan summit and dinner, prior to the summit, it was agreed that President Xi will undertake a State visit to Japan in the spring of next year, with the unanimous determination to usher in a new era in Japan.
Japan and China share a great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
It is my firm belief that a new model of future relations between the two countries, working together to address the issues facing the region and the world and contributing to the international community, will be beneficial.
In conclusion, I wish Japan every success in its relations and my friends great success in their endeavours.
“It is estimated that over-age farmers on some sites account for more than half of them.
Where do we find young workers now?
There's no way to use so many "old people" on the site."
In recent days, Zou Kui, a contractor working in the construction industry, has lamented the existence of a large number of over-age farmers on the site (over and above retirement age).
In recent times, I have been working on rain-distribution projects in my high schools, where a large number of farm workers are present and, if observed, there are a large number of over-age farmers.
Over-age farmers do not go out to work, but rather because they are “not free” and have the insatiable and difficult – whether they save money to solve their old-age and medical problems or help their children – that forces these old people, who were supposed to be “free” to continue to work hard.
The "good old age" of over-age farmers is not as easy as we thought.
Child-rearing, support for the elderly, schooling for the children, helping the children build buildings to buy cars, helping the children to start a family, and raising grandchildren from generation to generation. When these farm workers complete their “life mission”, the bags have been emptied, and even many debts have been made, and most of their wealth has been accumulated.
In order not to drag children, but also to save some wealth for themselves, many farmers insist on “doing as long as they can”.
Many “after 80” “after 90” and even “after 00” new generations of farmers are reluctant to engage in secondary or low-end services that are under difficult conditions and labour-intensive, creating structural “workless jobs” that are unattractive and provide opportunities for over-age farmers.
As a result of a lack of skills and a decline in physical and labour capacity, many over-age farmers are engaged in high-intensity, low-income, high-risk and low-security jobs.
A day's work is a day's work, and a little more is a little more, and the survival dilemma of the over-age farmers behind the “don't be idle” cannot be ignored and ignored.
Addressing the problems of wage arrears and bargaining, improving labour protection, reducing security risks, increasing labour income and improving the survival of over-age rural workers, in addition to their “self-help” work, is also dependent on the public sector's system of care and human care.
It has been pointed out by scholars that over-age farmers are no longer likely to rely on their homes to grow land to solve their old-age and medical problems, and that they must support their families through other means.
The inability and strength to understand the “freeness” of over-age farmers help us to better understand the love and pain of over-age farmers.
Seeing the backs of the over-age farmers, hearing their sighs, trying to get them back to the countryside to really make their “good old” sense, requiring the public sector, markets and society to share their responsibilities in a virtuous interaction and to combine their efforts.
Chemetsov stated that Russia would not export such a system for the next five years because “first supply of its own military forces will be followed by export production”.
This practice is fully consistent with international practice.
The main producers of weapons and military equipment are always the first to ensure their defence needs and then to process export orders.
Earlier, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Sky Force, General Yuri Glehoff, said that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the “Goldstone-Antai” Sky Defense Concene.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft systems that apply the working principles used to destroy ballistics and aerodynamics objectives.
The main role of S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which are capable of intercepting missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometres.
In addition, according to certain information, S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of drones, ultrasonic missiles five times faster than sound, even near space targets.
Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems, in particular the S-400 system, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergei Chemetsov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said that the system was currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army also needed it, including in the Arctic region.
S-400 air defence systems are in service with the Arctic air defence corps.
According to information received on 15 September, the reconfiguration of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the New Earth Islands Arctic Air Defence Corps has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely a process within the plan for the transition to more advanced defence tools in the strategic direction of the north.
According to the news service of the Russian Northern Fleet, “According to the transition to a new S-400 air defence system, the controlled airspace of the Arctic region has significantly increased.”
It is very important that the military assess that the system has been used successfully in the far north and the Arctic.
Air Defence Corps personnel trained in the new system and were ready to enter combat duty.
The S-300 long-range air defence system, which was previously equipped, is still partially maintained.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must possess weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, be they high-speed targets at the outer altitude or “fish leaking” close to protected facilities.
According to open sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by the “Gold Diamonds-Antai” Sky Defence Concene, was designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, ultrasound targets and other aerial assault weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 kilometres and shoot down ballistic targets at a range of 60 kilometres and 4.8 kilometres per second.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the far north to ensure the safety of air space on the northern seaways.
Not long ago, the first 12 “Tor”-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, sufficient to form an air defence battalion to strengthen anti-aircraft systems in the Arctic.
At that time, the Russian Ministry of Defence indicated that the Arctic “Tor” force would be extended to full brigade-size units in the future.
Together with the new S-400 long-range system deployed on New Earth Island and the Kola peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range system deployed in the far north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are a powerful shield for the Russian polar sky.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defence.
In the view of the Russian Government, the flagship shop would serve as a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own.
Rusty, a Russian store operator, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
The biggest trading platforms in China, such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, Hand Q (ShouQ), Multifunctional Instant Communications Software Wechat, have online shops and have their own online platforms Epinduo.com and Russian retail chains.
The Russian Export Centre will work with Russian suppliers to develop marketing strategies and criteria for participation in shops and to screen virtual shelf-loading enterprises.
The store plans to open by the end of this year and to build up at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to data from the Russian Export Centre, the total number of visits per month by China's power suppliers'platforms is as high as 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, reaching more than $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, the Alibaba Group will also open pilot shops for the sale of commodities from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the Global Import Strategy.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display goods from enterprises selling at least 500 million roubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and 500 million rubles are underselling.
As we all know, Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods and view our commodities as high quality and green and green.”
Kozhevnikov stated that competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power was intense and increasing.
He said, “Our goal is ambitious, to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years.”
At the same time, the platform will also carry the products of Russian enterprises in the Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of the Basics of Trade Policy, Plyanov Economic University, Russia, said: “This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export centre is a State-owned rather than a private institution.”
“I don’t see a lot of highly competitive Russian goods on the market.”
He believed that the project would probably not be implemented in real terms, but would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to the Russian News Agency, Andrei Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Centre, stated during the Eastern Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian enterprises'product information had been published on the largest international wholesaler platform, Alibaba.com, and could be purchased in China and elsewhere.
In addition, there is a model for cooperation with the Alibaba Group, namely, a training project for Russian enterprises by experts from the University of Poetry, the first of which was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Centre will also be the organizer of the participation of Russian enterprises in industry exhibitions and business projects at the Second China International Import Fair in Shanghai in November of this year.
A major exhibition will be held in the 1,000 m2 exhibition hall, which will also serve as a centre for commercial project activities, protocol signing ceremonies, promotions and meetings with Chinese business representatives.
Approximately 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
According to the Information Service of the Russian Export Centre: “In addition to the agricultural stand, we are bound to hold business meetings, i.e. to arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs.”
“This is another direction of our efforts aimed at supporting businesses and ensuring that dozens of specialized meetings are arranged for them.”
In addition, the Fair will hold master courses, cooking competitions and Russian-renowned cook-cooked food fairs for the Russian project “Exploring Russian Food Top Sea Stations”.
Following the decision of the Mohamud Adi Coroner's Coroner's Court on Friday that the cause of death was not accidental, the police waited for the full report and for instructions from the Attorney-General's Office to take the next step.
On Friday, the National Police Criminal Investigation Department issued a statement to the effect that, in accordance with the decision of the Coroner's Court, the police would await further instructions from the Attorney-General's Office.
In his statement, he stressed that the police had never terminated the investigation into the Mohamud murder, which was still ongoing.
On the other hand, Chief of Police of the State of Cheyenne, NOAA, stated that the police would await a full report on the content of the relevant decision before taking action.
He responded in this way when he was questioned on Friday morning after attending the handover ceremony of the duties of the Deputy Chief of Police in the State of snow police headquarters.
He stated that the police had investigated the case on the basis of the relevant reports.
He added that the police would also look at the progress of the investigation and decide whether to call back those who had been taken earlier.
The journalist learned from the Beijing City Forest Greening Authority that, in the recent 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China, the city of Beijing had recently adopted Chang-anang Street and its vicinity as its main axis, raising the landscape of the landscape in a comprehensive manner and creating a climate of peace and joy.
At present, all 12 square flower stands along Chang'an Street have been completed, with 20 million gardens of flowers all over the city dressed as beautiful capitals and dressed up for the national festival.
For days to come, the 12 lilydo-like, 3-story landscapes along Chang'an Street have attracted a large number of objective public visits and photographs.
These flower altars are very topical, starting with the “brilliant 70 years” at the north-west corner of the founding gate, and ending with the “good tomorrow” at the north-east corner of the revival gate, and are a tribute to the remarkable achievements of the new China in all fields in its 70 years of existence and a demonstration of the happiness of the people.
The director of the Beijing Parks and Gardens Greening Bureau explained that this year's greening of the environment took full advantage of its own innovations and brought together new domestic and international varieties and technologies.
More than 230 varieties have been applied as a whole, including 16 autonomous breeds, 18 green anti-reverse new varieties and 11 indigenous plants.
The country's self-proclaimed "Cool and Fashion" and "Autumn Candy" and "Autumn and Autumn" are being used for the first time.
In an effort to celebrate the National Day, Beijing has also recently undertaken a comprehensive clean-up of the city-wide landscape-greening landscape environment by replanting more than 12,000 logs, 230,000 shrubs and 2.3 million square metres of grass roots.
At the same time, 200 thematic flowers have been set up in important areas such as the city-wide roundabout, the Long An Street Extension Line, the Shan Memorial Site, the perimeters of the new airport and the perimeters of the major tourist attractions. The planting of flowers amounts to 20 million pellets, 10,000 small pieces of flowers, 5,000 groups of combo containers and 15,000 flying boxes have resulted in the overall upgrading of the greening of the environmental landscape in the capital.

The U.S. e-smoking has killed 12 people in 805 cases of lung damage.
According to the Central News Agency, on 26 local time, United States health officials indicated that 12 people had died from e-smoking-related diseases throughout the United States and 805 cases of lung damage related to e-smoking.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States reported these figures and indicated that specific substances leading to the disease had not yet been identified.
However, most patients reported the use of electronic smoke products containing tetrahydrocannabinol, the main compound in cannabis that affected mental state.
The surge in lung cases is known to be related to the purchase of contaminated electronic smokers on the black market.
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the above-mentioned 12 deaths occurred in 10 states ranging from California to Florida, and 805 confirmed and suspected cases were notified by 46 states and the United States Virgin Islands.
Electronic tobacco sales have been banned in India and the United States of America over the past three weeks, and in New York and Michigan they have been banned.
According to reports, the Trump Government intends to ban electronic tobacco products that taste other than tobacco from October.
When's the next bus coming?
"The Internet + Smart Station" gives you some insight.
On 27 September, the Nanjing Smart Traffic Union Goth map announced that the country's first Internet+Intelligent Stations would be officially launched in Nanjing, when 54 public transport electronic screens would be lit, which would result in an overall upgrading of Nanjing's information services, greater efficiency of public transport services and better mobility for ordinary people.
In the past, the anxiety scenes of waiting vehicles were performed almost every day at the bus stop.
It is difficult to predict the duration of bus operations, the conditions along the routes and the location of the vehicles, and the issue of the public handing over of pain points needs to be resolved, especially in some major cities, where long commuting distances and complex traffic conditions during morning and evening commutes peak hours have led to persistent difficulties in securing the rate of public transport.
To this end, Nanjing Wisdom Transport, together with the Goth Map, explored the new orientation of “Internet+Travel” and launched the country's first “Internet+Intelligent Station” intellectual service project.
According to the information received, the country's first Internet + Smart Stations landed in Nanjing, integrating the Goethe Big Data and the Goethe vehicles' projected time to travel ETA algorithms, and relying on bus electronics and mobile Internet, major traffic data upgrades to achieve the ability to publish bus routes on the two ends of the bus smart station + electronic map, the expected time of the bus to stop, etc.
Through the Internet + Smart Station, Nanjing citizens not only have easy access to the expected arrival of the bus, the real-time location of the bus and the number of stops at the current site, but also the three-colour visualization of the roadway through orange greens, making it possible to see the real-time status of all bus lines through the site.
Thanks to the “Internet+Intelligent Station” technology, the citizens of Nanjing have achieved easy and efficient public hand-over procedures such as “access to public transport places before leaving the country, know the time of arrival, and know the time of arrival at the destination at the time of the bus”.
On the basis of real-time bus information from Internet+smart stations, it is possible to select the most suitable travel route for itself, while at the same time providing psychological expectations and reducing the anxiety of waiting vehicles, thus making travel easier.
Xinhua Network for the first time in more than 30 cases.
The journalist was informed by the Beijing City and Park Administration that a total of 99 sets of fine items had been displayed, of which more than 30 were presented to the public for the first time, displaying a rich collection of court objects and their traditional life culture.
According to the information received, the exhibition was divided into four exhibition areas, namely, Ruyyu Jiqing, ultimatum Fukugi, eccentric arts, and branding, and displaying to the audience objects of various kinds, such as bronze, ancient books, miscellaneous, china, etc. The object's design and tattoos reflect the theme of “Friends”.
The Deputy Director of the Department of Antiquities of the Park Service, Xia Li Jia, introduced the high-level exhibition of cultural objects in number, variety of items and age of exhibits.
Nearly 30 per cent of the exhibits are State-level and secondary cultural objects, and the age spans from commercial generations to the years of cleanness.
For more than 3,000 years now, the exhibit has produced a “oldest” bronze object; a great body and weight of nearly 80 pounds is carved from an entire piece of green sculpt and kept in perfect condition and rare; and the pebbles bells of the mountain figure, the South Jai collection painting book, the South Jai Envelope Law, etc., are among the best objects to be displayed to the public for the first time.
According to Qin Lei, Deputy Director of the Beijing City and Garden Administration, this cultural exhibition, in keeping with the spirit of “living up”, is based on the idea of gardening and on the concept of the “Fukuyama Sea” of the Garden, using as a vehicle the collection of “Favourful Life” items as a vehicle for visitors to learn about Ying and the deep life culture of the Garden, to promote and transmit the traditional Chinese culture, and to convey the best wishes for the celebration of Good Friday.
According to the information received, the exhibition will continue until 30 January 2020.
Xinhua Times Review: We're on our own.
The White Paper " China and the World of the New Age ", published on 27 September, answered that China's development had been successful for 70 years, and that the fundamental reason was that, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people had found the right path to development, with the socialism of the Chinese identity, and had followed it with determination.
China follows its own path of development. It is the choice of history and of its people.
In recent times, in a climate of poverty and internal and external distress, generations of human beings have sought and followed the path of national salvation.
However, “the constitutional monarchy, the reintroduction, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system have all thought about and tried, and none of this will work.”
It was only with the Communist Party of China and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a socialist path of Chinese identity in practice.
China's path is one of happiness for the Chinese people, the revival of the Chinese nation and the common development of China and the rest of the world.
It is on the right path that China can do its job well, become the second largest economy in the world and contribute most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As stated in the White Paper, China's development path, which is consistent with China's national circumstances and adapted to the requirements of the times, will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
In retrospect, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path, which they value even more in view of the world.
The Chinese understood the logic of South Orange and understood that what was good for others was not good for themselves, but best for themselves.
It is with this road of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a world-renowned miracle.
In the course of the twists and turns of the human race, the “end of history” was famous for a while.
Today, the success of the socialist path of China’s identity has brought to an end the “end of history”, the collapse of the “China collapse” and the failure of the “socialist failure.”
China's success had boosted the confidence of developing countries to become rich and powerful and had expanded the way for developing countries to become modern. It had provided experience and lessons for countries and peoples in the world that wished to accelerate their development while maintaining their independence and to follow a path that was consistent with their national circumstances.
The world is rich and diverse.
China has always respected the right of each country to choose the path of development appropriate to its own circumstances.
China will not “enter” the foreign model, nor “export” the Chinese model, but will resolutely pursue its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges with countries on governance and good governance, and make its due contribution to the common realization of good governance and good governance.
At Fair Work Commission, it was found that a 66-year-old female worker was dismissed by text from the owner of the Foodworks supermarket because he preferred to hire employees from an Asian background, whose practices were strongly criticized as “honourable”.
The Board stated that Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang, English name Eddie, who had worked at Wagga store for more than 20 years, had treated her employees in a way that was “unfair” and could violate the anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the shop in 2016 and that he had “wanted to fire me” because she was not Chinese.
In this case, the Vice-Chairman of the Commission, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found that “Mr. Wang had published a number of job advertisements in various Australian employment forums in the past”.
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one said “the first Asian woman” and the other “the first Asian employee”.
The third post states that he “would prefer overseas people (sic)”.
Mr. Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton by text message in April this year, later claiming that this was due to her absence from work and the alleged small cash deficit of $5.10 to $30 on the cash register.
Mr. Sams stated, however, that Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She's only been absent from one of her classes for three years, and the missing amount amounts to a few Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton's dismissal was “in fact unrelated to her conduct or performance”.
He said, “It seems to me that, supported by the evidence of Mr. Wang's advertisement for the job, the real reason why she should be fired is that he prefers to hire employees with an Asian background.
According to section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act (FairWork Act), Mr. Wang's actions appear to constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or an unlawful dismissal of the applicant.”
Mr. Sams stated that it was not appropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton's position in view of his “horrifying” treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, a temporary worker with an hourly salary of $26.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams indicated that he would submit his own decisions and documents to the Committee for consideration as to whether Mr. Wang's actions should be transferred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws.
He states that Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said, “I think it would be appropriate for the defence to take an irresistible, unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang “wait” for the opportunity, which, in his view, would ‘prove’ the termination of the applicant’s employment.”
“He was wrong... to dismiss the applicant in total disregard of any natural justice and, astonishingly, his imprudent and grossly unjust perfunctory conduct.”
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business, “it must be said frankly that no decent employer will dismiss an employee in the most unfair and perfunctory manner recognized in this case.”
He said, "This is shameful and extremely unfair."
Guangtai is on the run for the Golden Week, increasing the number of passenger trains 175 - China's new network.
On 27 September, a journalist in Guangzhou (Ko Jun Xu Xu) learned from Guangqiang that, in order to meet the requirements for travel by passengers on the Golden Week on the National Day, Guangqiang will be driving an additional train in hot directions, with a total of 175 passenger trains on each day of the holiday, which will increase overall the capacity to travel during the Golden Week bus peak on the National Day.
The Hiroshima Group will undertake a number of initiatives to provide passenger services during high-flow periods.
The three-storey security perimeter has been optimized at the south station in Guangzhou, with 12 additional security corridors and a total of 44 security corridors in the third-storey waiting room. In addition, 19 self-help real-name validation devices have been added at the south station in Guangzhou, for the purpose of opening the passenger flow line, for a total of 71.
In order to ease the presence and congestion of vehicles on the South South Station, three new parking lots will be opened in Guangzhou South Station, adding 1,000 parking spaces and easing the pressure on the perimeter of the South Station.
The Shenzhen North station will open a “high-trail” free green passage.
From 6 to 7 October, at the height of the flow, the A2 exit at Shenzhen North Station will be connected to the subway, with a free passage route to facilitate the movement of passengers arriving at the peak hours.
In addition, East and West Square will regularly set up the U-Claire Fast Track to serve passengers who arrive at the station 15 minutes before driving, as well as special priority passengers.
On the eve of the Golden Week of the National Day, the All-China Nine Passenger Section conducts full-time operational training to ensure that the entire crew who perform the functions acquires operational knowledge, improves the quality of service, and ensures that the train attendants perform every trip with a good mental face and a more professional standard of performance to provide a better quality of service to passengers.
Six people denied being involved in the sale of pseudo-macca paper, and the case was referred to the High Court.
Six men suspected of counterfeiting and selling our passports, printed papers and identity cards, including an assistant director of the National Register and a businessman at the rank of governor, passed the case on Thursday, and the magistrates approved the charges against trafficking in persons and trafficking in migrants and referred them to the High Court for trial.
Among them was the defence counsel for the Chinese-Chinese defendant Le Zhenhua (translation), as well as Congressman Ryer of Sunset Hole District, who applied to the judge to withdraw from the hearing on behalf of the defendant and ceased to represent the defendant, and was granted leave in court.
He states that he himself attracted criticism from his political opponents by representing the accused, and that his party of action was also implicated.
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threat in himself, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to discredit the Action Party and the Greek Government or other Greek leadership, and that the decision was taken after careful consideration.
He adds that there is no conflict of interest between representing the accused and being a member of Parliament, that he is not legally prohibited from representing any of the accused and that, to date, the accused Le Zhenhua has not been convicted.
The six accused were charged before the courts on 12 September of this year and denied their guilt and were not granted bail pending trial, in the face of numerous charges under article 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Trafficking in Migrants Act and article 466 of the Criminal Code (forgery of documents).
On Thursday, two District Court Judges, Noshahaha, and Mazlan, after the arguments of both parties, granted the prosecution's application for referral to the High Court of the charges against the six accused for the anti-trafficking in persons and anti-trafficking in migrants ordinances; the charges of forgery of documents will be heard on 3 October, pending the prosecution's transfer of the documents to the defence.
The earlier six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Order 2012 (SOSMA) and the judge therefore did not grant bail.
Walking with the motherland — a unit of the Armed Police.
A unit of an armed police force of an average height of 1.83 metres was in a busy state of training at the military parade.
Shining spears, unique olive greens and red shoulders together form a bright landscape.
The day before, journalists walked into the party and felt the determination of the military police officers to remain party and loyal to the people, as well as their “honour above all” love and pursuit.
“Dreams shine a glorious life, writing the immortal legends of a new era...” this is a team song written by a team of soldiers and soldiers – Walking with the Fatherland.
In the team, this song is the motto of every member of the team.
Qui Xiaolight, 1.92 metres tall, was particularly visible on the side team.
He has a deeper understanding of honour as the champion of the former Carabinieri of the Carabinieri of the Carabinieri of the Carabinieri of the Armed Forces.
The honor of the military comes from hard training.
Qui Xiao Guang, a flagr, has always been a high standard of training.
He was strapped to sandbags, stuck to a second watch for speed, blindfolded for gadgets, and stabilized with a stormy wind.
In his “flag career”, there is a picture that remains unforgettable.
A flag-raising ceremony brought down heavy rains, while none of the tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony left.
The moment the flag was raised, Xiaoqing felt deeply the glory represented by the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, Qui Xiaoqiao was selected as the base soldier.
The base soldier and the flagman have different standards of movement.
Xi Xiao Guang explained that more than 20 paces of progress in the movement of flagmen and benchmark soldiers had to be followed by more efforts in training.
The benchmark is the first in the first row and directly determines the level of alignment of the formations.
After intensive training by the parade, he repeatedly kicked his legs on a daily basis and practiced hard kicks.
In the demonstration, he won a round of applause at the exact scale and speed of his march.
Almost every member of the team has the same experience as Xi Xiao Guang.
Two decades ago, the father of the soldier, Zhu Xu, was a participant in the 50th anniversary parade.
In order to follow his father's footsteps as a member of the team, he suffered repeated setbacks but was never discouraged.
He said, “It is an honor for me to walk through Tiananmen Square like my father, and to be seen by the party and the people in my life, and I will suffer whatever it takes.”
"The Master of the Capital's Stabilisation" has eight large words in his eyes.
Mr. Wang Qian, the party’s members are all from the Beijing Brigade of the Carabineros – an army with a glorious tradition, with major tasks such as the opening of the country, the national celebrations, the security of successive party national congresses and the maintenance of counter-terrorism in the capital – and the creation of a large group of British models and individuals, such as the “flag guard” and the “war hero squadron” – and more than 50 units and individuals were awarded honours by the State Department, the Central Military Commission and the Armed Police.

The country's railways are the deepest of the main wells to be dug to the bottom.
On September 27, Xinhua Society Kunming (journalist Ding Yien), according to the China Iron Tunnels Corporation Ltd., the country’s first-largest railway – the Grand (Li) Rie (Li) railway, which successfully dug to the bottom on the 27th day of the main well of the rig 1 in the Gorlegon Hill Tunnel – broke the record of the country’s railway rigs by 762.59 metres deep.
In the construction of the tunnels, the wells can improve the ventilation of the tunnels, improve the efficiency of the project and guarantee the safety of the works.
“When successfully dug to the bottom, the main well of the Sanctuary No. 1 in the Gallegon Hill Tunnel will contribute to the construction of the bottom of the well, open up multiple working surfaces for later construction, and speed up the construction of the entire Goligan Hill Tunnel.”
According to SONG Tao, the construction of the Sanctuary No. 1 in the Goligon Hill Tunnel was carried out using a well-drilling method, equipped with a well-drilling, well-drilling vehicle, a hangar, an overall mobile metal template, an FJD-6A umbrella drill, a central rollback rock grab, etc., which resulted in the development of a “four-size” mechanized stream of water, such as a mechanized excavation system, a swirling system, a hanging system, a hanging system, a hanging system, and a full-process mechanized operation, such as an eye-cracker, a bursting, a break-out, a template installation, a concrete-filling system, etc., which significantly accelerated the construction process.
It is understood that the Grand-Sweet Railway, which is approximately 331 kilometres long and is designed at 140 kilometres per hour, is an important component of the Central-Myanmar international railway route.
The Goligon Hill tunnel, which is 34.538 km long, is the first long rail tunnel in our country.
The TV show "Fox Hunting" is a field view, and it's a line of surveillance.
In the recent field viewing at Tianjin airport of the episode of the transnational investigation of the " Fox Hunting ", actors such as Wang Kai and Wang Guo filmed important scenes such as the escorting back to the country of a fugitive economic suspect. The film was supported by China Southern Airlines.
The Fox-hunting team this time filmed the key scene at the airport that most showcased the results of Operation Fox – the capture of fugitives, the taking of planes, the signing of arrest warrants, and so on.
The group took pictures of the tarmacs, customs border checks, passenger cabins, hatches, etc., and recreated the difficult and professional journeys of Chinese police officers and fox-hunting heroes across the country in pursuit of fugitive criminals.
In order to successfully complete the film, the Fox Hunting team made a great deal of advance preparations, repeatedly confirming every detail of implementation and ensuring the most real and direct visual effect.
According to the information received, the play will also be filmed in a number of locations abroad.
Viet Nam needs to seize opportunities for artificial intelligence development.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities in terms of their level of preparedness to face the AI wave include prospects, ability to realize, asset base and development direction.
Singapore is ranked first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert from the organization, responded to an interview with a journalist on behalf of Mohin Pevana, saying: “I find it very interesting to review and assess cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam.
On the whole, I believe that Viet Nam's future is bright in a context of high growth rates, strong economic development paths and rapid growth of the human base.
I think Viet Nam is on the right track and doing well.
It is important that Viet Nam know how to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the fourth industrial revolution to promote more economic development.”
Artificial intelligence is completely transforming people's work, communication and way of life.
It brings with it greater efficiency, but it also poses a threat of increasing social, economic and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, there are no cities in the world today that are ready for the breakthroughs of the age of artificial intelligence.
Guterres expressed his pleasure to celebrate China's 70th anniversary here together and congratulated the Chinese Government and people on their impressive achievements over the past 70 years.
Gutierrez said, “Every time I visit China, I am shocked by the pace of change and progress.
You created one of the most dynamic economies in the world, and helped lift more than 850 million people out of poverty – the greatest poverty alleviation achievement in history.”
He said that in achieving the vision of the Millennium Development Goals, China had witnessed transformative results: infant and maternal mortality rates had declined, nutrition had improved, the number of stunted people had decreased and the number of people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation had been halved.
At the same time, China has one of the best educational systems in the world, attracting international students from all over the world.
The photo exhibit celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is open today at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Guterres stated that this year also marks the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations presence in China.
Over the past 40 years, China has been a key player in the work of the United Nations and has been a pillar of international cooperation and multilateralism.
After advancing the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, China was actively pursuing the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As the second largest contributor to the regular and peacekeeping budgets of the United Nations, China has been a partner in ensuring the stability of United Nations activities.
China has contributed troops to eight peacekeeping missions, including more than 1,000 “Blue Helmets” soldiers on mission in South Sudan.
According to Guterres, “As the United Nations approaches its seventy-fifth anniversary, we need to re-establish a global partnership in support of multilateral solutions to global crises.
I look forward to China’s continued commitment and participation in building a better world for all.”

After 70 years, China is young, high and bright, and regardless of how the international winds and clouds change, we will stick to our hearts and minds.
Wang Yi met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi, Kassala
On 26 local time, the Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi, Kassala, during his presence in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
His Majesty stated that over the 12 years since the establishment of the Sino-Ma border, relations between the two countries have developed in a healthy and stable manner, and exchanges and cooperation in various fields have steadily advanced.
Last year, President Xi Jinping invited President Mutharika to the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, where the two heads of State held fruitful meetings to lead the Chinese-Ma relations to the new steps.
China is ready, together with Malaysia, to continue to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of State and the outcome of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and to promote further practical cooperation between the two countries.
China is ready to strengthen its cooperation and coordination in international affairs in order to safeguard the common interests of the two sides and to promote relations between the Central African Republic and China.
Kassala stated that China was a true friend of Malawi and African countries and that its development had benefited the people of Malawi.
His delegation was committed to the one-China policy and was grateful for the support and assistance it had provided to Malawi.
Malaysia looks forward to the further development of relations between the two countries and welcomes more Chinese enterprises to invest in the country.
About 800 million people traveled to China on the Fourth of July to reflect the demand and supply of tourism in China.
About 800 million people will be traveling on the upcoming 11th Golden Week!
Large data from a number of tourism platforms show that the country's tourism consumer market is both supply and demand booming.
The CNM report projects that, in the light of previous national holiday tourism statistics, the number of domestic tourists is expected to be close to 800 million this year, and more than 7.5 million more trips are expected to take place abroad.
At present, tourists from more than 500 cities, covering 100 countries and territories, book products such as tours, free travel, customized tourism and local play, through the platform.
According to the Chinese Institute of Tourism, 726 million domestic tourists were hosted on the national holiday last year, an increase of 9.43 per cent over the previous year.
Not only will the number of tourists be renewed, but the increase in consumption will also be the “mode” of the holiday.
The couriers report that the national holiday, which cost more than $3,000 per person for inter-provincial tourism in the country, is an increase over the same period last year, as tourists generally opt for better-experienced products, such as high-rated brand hotels, shopping-free tours, elite groups, car-specific guides, etc.
There is a similar trend, as data from the Donkey Mother's Travel Network bookings show that “principal groups” of less than 10 people are more popular than in previous years, using comfortable cars throughout the long line of the country.
Spring and fall tourism data show that their consumers prefer “slow-paced” experiences, services and differences.
On the other hand, data on flying pigs show that the country’s four-line and suburban tourist arrivals are growing fastest, at a 30-per-cent rate on a year-on-year basis, refracturing the rising consumption of more parts of the country’s population.
Personalization is a major feature of this year's Golden Week.
Portfolio data show that the annual holiday rental car is expected to grow by nearly 60% compared to the same year, while the short-distance travel of small groups of people visiting the perimeter continues to be acclaimed; private group registrations have increased by up to 155% compared to the previous year.
The sharing of joy has become the main purpose of people's tourism and leisure.
Portfolio data show that 28 per cent of visitors to the holidays on the occasion of the National Day are parents and children, 25 per cent are couples and 23 per cent are colleagues and friends.
In terms of the age of tourists, “after 80” and “after 90” account for more than 50 per cent of the total number of visitors.
It is a matter of concern that, unlike in the past, there has been a more rapid growth in the gold sector of the country, and that the domestic market has shown a more “optimal” performance this year.
Flying pig data show a 42% increase in the number of bookings for the country’s cultural and travel routes this year’s national holiday, exceeding the speed of the trip.
Industry analyses that, while demand is strong, tourism supply side reforms are being promoted across the country to provide tourists with a richer “unique feast”.
For example, the National Directorate of Sports and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have recently issued a joint release entitled “Fine Lines for Sports and Tourism for the 11th Golden Week of 2019”; the Shanghai Tourism Festival, which is being held in 2019, has launched seven cultural and tourist spots to attract foreign and Chinese tourists; and several provinces, such as Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan and Shandong, have introduced measures to reduce fares or provide free of charge.
Portfolio data show that destinations with unique natural or cultural characteristics are the most “fire” in the country, and Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xian, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Tianjin will be the most popular tourist destinations in the country.
Our first live movie, "At this time – celebrated the 70th birthday of New China, will be broadcast simultaneously on October 1 in 70 cinemas in more than 10 provinces of the country.
The central radio and television station will broadcast live on the big screen the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the New China conference, military parades and mass marches via a 4K super-highlight signal.
The head of the central radio and television station introduced in Kyoto 27 that, on the occasion of the National Day, the station would build more than 100 airspaces and install more than 200 sound-picking devices along Changan Street and at high points in the celebration area, using camera language and simultaneous sound, leading to the first full-flow, full-component 4K super-high and 5.1 roundabouts.
China is expected to become the largest export market for beef in Australia.
An animal protein analyst from the Dutch Cooperative Bank (Rabobank) said that, following the outbreak of the African pigpest, China faced a severe shortage of pork and was expected to become Australia's largest export market for beef.
In the wake of the outbreak, Chinese consumers are shifting from eating pork to other animal proteins, which has led to the destruction of many herds by the authorities. In the past year, the number of live pigs in China has been halved and the price of pork has almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two thirds of the world's pork.
According to Chenjun Pan, a senior animal protein analyst from the Dutch cooperative bank in China, demand for other meats, including beef, has increased, with China, the world’s largest animal protein importer, currently importing 27% of world pork, and beef imports 24%.
Ms. Ban said that Chinese imports of beef from Australia had increased by 65 per cent in the first half of the year, and China had surpassed the United States and Japan and had become Australia's largest export market for beef.
Yesterday, the Chinese Government stated that more pork would be released from emergency reserves before the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.

Wang Yi: To help Africa achieve peace and security, China has never been absent.
On 26 September, local time, the Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended an open meeting of the Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York on “Peace and security in Africa”.
In his statement, Wang Yi stated that China and Africa were good friends, brothers and partners.

The world's highest-age barber died at the age of 108 and had his hair cut for 96 years.
In the United States, there is Anthony Mancinelli, the world’s highest-age barber certified in the world record of King’s in New York, who, 108 years old, never retired to his daily daily hairdressing for his guests, but 19 days after Mansinelli passed away from his 96-year-old hairdresser’s life as a result of cancer in his jaw.
According to CNN, Mancinelli emigrated to the United States when he was eight years old, helped to clean the floor in a barber shop, and began to pick up scissors for customers at 12 years old, thereby easing the economic pressure in the home.
Mancinelli, although attending primary school at that time, did not graduate.
The son of Mansinelli, Robert, revealed that his father loved work and people from all over the world loved him, but he was diagnosed with cancer in February this year and was unable to work for physical reasons six weeks before he died, but that was not retirement because he planned to come back to cut his hair when he was better.
Robert, 82 years old, said that he had to find a new barber now after his father died, because he had been asked to cut his hair for the rest of his life.
During the year, listed companies bought back more than $100 billion in historic heights - Xinhuanet.
In order to stabilize the value of the company and maintain its image, listed companies have begun to buy back shares more frequently in the last two years and, through targeted buy-backs and pooling of competitive transactions, wish to convey to the market the information that the value of the company is undervalued, thereby stabilizing the value of the stock and enhancing investor confidence.
Eastern wealth Choice data show that listed companies spent $7.9 billion on repurchases in 2017, which surged to $51 billion in 2018, and that since 2019, A shares have been repurchased and implemented for a total amount of over $100 billion, bringing the A shares to a higher level than in previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of the repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares appears to be on the same increase as that of the major shareholder, but it varies considerably in terms of the subject of the implementation, the source of funds, the purpose of the repurchase, and the equity interest in the stock itself.
In an interview with the Daily Securities Journal journalist, Xu Yang, Chairman of McCoron Information Consulting Limited, Shanghai, stated that, in November 2018, the Opinion on Support for Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies had improved on the problems of the existing system of narrow repurchase of shares, complicated decision-making procedures and inadequate inventory systems, and that the practice of repurchase of shares had increased significantly in the year, as a result of policy incentives for repurchase of shares by listed companies.
In January of this year, the closing offices officially published the Regulations on the Implementation of Repurchase of Stock by Listed Companies, which broadens the sources of funding for repurchase by listed companies, streamlines implementation procedures, guides improved governance arrangements, and encourages listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee ownership schemes.
Following the issuance of the opinion, the listed company performed the repurchase of shares, which was more applicable, the repurchase process was easier and the repurchase of shares was more motivated.
Repurchase of shares at relatively low positions would also facilitate the efficient use of funds by listed companies, thereby increasing the level of profitability per share, increasing the rate of return on net assets and reducing the pressure on corporate profitability indicators.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is even more significant than the increase in large shareholders and reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their market value and cash flows.
Xuyang argued that undervaluation was a major factor in repurchases by listed companies, which were no longer able to reflect their future development prospects, and that such companies deserved the attention of investors, but could not invest blindly, and that attention needed to be paid to the financial statements and the specific operations of such listed companies.
Listed companies with large-scale buybacks at least demonstrate their development confidence and financial strength.
The repurchase enthusiasm of A-listed companies has also led to a steady increase in repurchase behaviour, with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented repurchases this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main players in the buy-back market.
China recently disclosed the progress of repurchases, stating that the company had accumulated 57.559 million shares in A through a centralized competitive exchange, accounting for 0.315 per cent of the company's total equity, that the total amount paid was $5 billion (excluding transaction costs), and that the repurchases would be used entirely for employee holding schemes, including, but not limited to, long-term service plans that had been considered and adopted by the company's shareholders'assembly.
The Ely shares have been paid $5,792 million for repurchase of shares and have recently been adjusted for repurchase of shares, from the planned “full repurchase of shares to be used as a source of later implementation of equity incentives” to “accumulative repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million were used to implement equity incentives, while the remaining 3,049 million shares will be used for write-off to reduce registered capital”.
The Ili shares indicated that the write-off of some of the repurchased shares would contribute to a further increase in the level of return per share and to an effective increase in the return on the investment of the company's shareholders.
On 25 September, the TCL Group issued an announcement on the progress of repurchases, indicating that TCL had accumulated 3.39 per cent of its shares, at a total cost of $1.65 billion.
The TCL Group Board Office stated to the Daily Securities Journal journalist that repurchases would be used for employee holding schemes, equity incentives or to convert corporate bonds issued by listed companies into equities.
The TCL Group adheres to established business strategies to continuously improve competitiveness and sustain healthy development.
Based on confidence in the future development of the company and the preservation of investor interests, the company plans to repurchase its shares using its own funds, self-financing and other forms of financing, taking into account, inter alia, the performance of the company's second-tier market over the past year and taking into account the company's business and financial situation.
According to Yang Delong, the chief economist at the former Kaitsu Foundation, the operation of stock buy-backs by listed companies can, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares in the market and increase each share of the earnings of listed companies, which is an important benefit for the value of the second-tier market; and, on the other hand, the willingness of listed companies to come forward with real silver and write-off shares from the stock market has greatly boosted market confidence.
Repurchases by domestic listed companies have been increasing in recent years, particularly for merit-based shares, and it is an excellent way to boost investor confidence through stock buy-backs, as well as a positive and encouraging approach.
Hunan Province’s Standing Committee and Changsha City Council’s Secretary, Hu Hshuhua, and the four leaders of the Engineering and Mechanical Manufacturing Army – Jan Junxin, Liang, Ho Qinghua, Liu Feihua – set a “small goal” around “from engineering machinery to smart manufacturing” – three or five years later, creating a world’s leading cluster of engineering and machinery industries.
The construction of the world's leading engineering and mechanical cluster in Changsha, in the current fashion, is “the strongest on the surface”.
As the capital city of the Inland Province, Changsha shouts such rhetoric.
It's based on the power of hegemonic leaks.
The four engineering and mechanical companies that took part in the dialogue, each with its own hands, covered the entire field of the sky, the ground, the sea and the sea: a light plane with a mountain river intelligence, a concrete transport pump from the Central Atomic Section, a full-ground crane for the trio, and a tunnel shield for the iron-builder, whose “hard power” could be considered unique and proud of the males.
At some point, China had virtually no voice in the field of engineering and machinery manufacturing.
In a time of transition, Chinese firms “introduction” “outward” two-wheel drive, taking advantage of the eastward winds of the “one-way” initiative, a combination of acquisition, mergers, plant-building, etc., has become a global industry of engineering and machinery.
Among them, the leading engineering and mechanical enterprises, such as the three-carrying industry, the Central and Central Joint Heavy Unit, the iron and steel construction industry and the mountain river intelligence industry, have taken a significant lead on key economic indicators such as the value of production, market ownership and sales.
It's time for the camera to move.
The "Four Great Kongs" of the Engineering Mechanics are among the elites of the Changsha Engineering and Mechanical Industries, as well as leading companies in the global engineering and mechanical industries.
In the world's industries, it is hard to say who survives and lives well.
In earlier years, the global engineering and machinery industry experienced a cold winter, and a number of internationally recognized engineering and mechanical manufacturing companies have fallen, but Changsha's engineering and machinery manufacturing firms have not only survived, but also strengthened their bones and bones by using “cat winters” as “winter swims”, putting pressure on themselves, breaking through themselves, transforming their industrial structures and transforming from manufacturing to ingenuity.
It’s because the moon’s politics are shared by the stars.
The development of industries of advantage requires both active enterprise and government action.
Changsha's reputation for “the capital of engineering machinery” is that it brings together a whole industry chain from upstream to downstream, creates a number of clusters of related industries, and significantly reduces the cost of R & D, manufacturing and marketing by optimizing the business environment, improving the supporting services, simplifying the approval process, etc.
Good business ecology has led to the emergence of engineering and machinery manufacturing enterprises.
History has pushed the sand to the front desk of the world's leading engineering machine.
Both Governments and enterprises, as well as the producers and researchers associated with them, should seize opportunities, step up, target and sustain their efforts to contribute to the creation of powerful countries.
Wang Yi chaired the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African States members of the Security Council.
Wang Yi said that China was a good brother and partner with African countries.
China stands firmly with its African brothers in the past, in the present and in the future.
We have advocated the convening of such a meeting of foreign ministers as a concrete step in the implementation of the important consensus reached between President Xi and the leaders of African countries at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation last September, in order to strengthen China's solidarity with African countries in the Council and to promote better international support for peace and development in Africa.
Wang Yi said that Africa was China's most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, China's vote in the Council has always belonged to a large number of developing countries, including African countries.
In the face of the new situation, China stands ready to work with African countries in the Council to strengthen solidarity and cooperation and to safeguard common interests.
The two sides should be united in their efforts to resolve disputes through consultation, self-reliance and development.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the African States participating in the Conference thanked China for its initiative to convene the Conference and congratulated the New China on its seventieth anniversary.
The Ministers stated that the relationship between Africa and China is based on equality and mutual respect and that Africa and China have always been the most trusted and trusted partners to each other.
It appreciated the important positive role played by China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, in African affairs, which had contributed significantly to a just and reasonable solution to Africa's problems and had made great efforts and contributions to the defence of Africa's interests and to the promotion of peace and security in Africa.
At a time when Africa faces the threat of terrorism and extremism, only by addressing security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
We look forward to further coordination of positions with China in the Council and enhanced solidarity and cooperation.
Wang Yi said that there was an important consensus at today's meeting.
We all support the preservation of multilateralism, the strengthening of the authority and role of the United Nations, the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rejection of unilateralism and hegemony; we all agree to strengthen mutual support and cooperation in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council and to safeguard the common interests of Central Africa and the developing countries in general; we all support the African approach to African problems and call for the United Nations to provide financial support for African-owned peace operations; we all support the concept of “cooperation for development and development for peace” to help African countries achieve autonomous and sustainable development; and we all stand firm in our defence of the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and reject any State that creates obstacles for them and denies them their right to development.
Gansu Qingyang: The lake sheep came to "get out of poverty".
The autumn of September rewrite the Yellow-Team Plateau.
The 58-year-old villager, Xavili, in a professional cooperative for the development of livestock in the town of El Ma, filled the canteens with the last herbs in the sheep, standing by the mounds and watching the white lake sheep chewing on their mouths.
"Eat well, when the fall and winter are full, you can get a good price out of the fence."
Xavilli says he feeds the sheep every day, regularly cleans and disinfects them, and takes care of themselves.
After more than 20 years of raising sheep, it was not until she came to work in the cooperative that she knew how rough herds were in the past.
Xavili is a member of the village of the summer flood pool in the town of Qingyang, Qingyang commune, Gansu province.
His right-hand neighbour is a sheep-breeding family, but he adheres to the traditional way in which the sheep are dispersed, of poor quality and of low standing.
In June of this year, 140 poor people in the village joined cooperatives under the guidance of the Government, and everything began to change.
Xavier Xavier spent all day working on farming because he was always holding on to it.
The stockholders, who are poor households, hold the sheep in trust to the cooperative and rely on him if they can divide the money and sell it at the end of the year.
It's good to have technical guidance, he learns to control the disease, he masters scientific feeding, and he becomes “good” for a small number of farm animals in the village.
The Professional Cooperative for the Benefit is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lake goats.
The cooperative leader, Zoutao, said that there were doors both inside and outside standardized sheep sheds.
"The wool is thick, it can easily breed bacteria, the lake sheep can't stay in a hot, wet place, the shed must be built in a three-sided ditch, and it must be filled with a wind changer to ventilate and evaporate the heat."
Zoutao stated that, in order to prevent the disease, it was also necessary to spray and disinfect sheep regularly and give them three to four vaccination needles during the quarter.
In addition to living well, the “fat” have to eat herbs that are mixed with green grains, wheat herbs, herbs, etc., and are sufficiently wide to stretch their bones in a playground.
The cooperative, using a foster-care approach, directs local farmers to place good-breeding, management, marketing, good-planting, scientificization, standardization and intensive farming.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep in their shares receive more than $6,000 per household per year, and four poverty-alleviation recipients work in cooperatives.
From “grazing up mountains” to “precision feeding”, from “local mating” to “ artificial insemination”, from “seeing body size, touching belly” to “doing B super” in Gansu Qingyang, goat farming is more than just a shift in feeding patterns, and the model of “long business plus cooperative plus farm households” has changed the image of former “sheep-raising on mountain slopes and sheep-selling in markets”, overcoming the weakness of traditional farming and the poor life of farmers as a result of modern sheep-raising.
Zoutao said that if market prices were weak, the local leader, Gansu Shun Sheeng Farming Development Co. Ltd., would buy up at a market price of $27 per kilogram, helping farmers to spread market risk.
Xu Jianfeng, General Adviser, Gansu Agricultural and Livestock Development Co. Ltd., said that enterprises had led an increasing number of poor households to learn about the “goats” through the provision of credit guarantees, sheep farming, order farming, purchase of quotations, and integrated processing and marketing services for poor households.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families achieved a steady increase in their harvests through the cultivation of grasses, the breeding of good seeds, large-scale farming, the division of slaughter and the marketing of the market in the “confederation”.
The city of Qingyang is located in a staggered northern agricultural belt and has abundant resources for herbing.
Currently, there are 913 large-scale sheep farms, cooperatives and more than 5 million goats, and two 1.3 million meat and sheep slaughter-scale processing production lines have been built throughout the city, and the herds are becoming “lead sheep” for poverty alleviation in the industry.
The French Chancellor said he'd cut taxes by more than €10 billion next year and called on Germany to follow suit.
September 26th, Reuters -- French Chancellor Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros (US$ 10.9 billion) next year, and that Germany should keep pace with France’s fiscal stimulus in order to revive its depressed economy.
In presenting the French budget for 2020, Le Mel stated that the European Central Bank’s latest monetary easing initiative had created an opportunity for Governments of capable member States to increase investment.
The ECB reached a record low in interest rates on 12 September, and plans to restart its purchase debt in order to lower borrowing costs in the hope of stimulating economic recovery and boosting inflation.
“The low interest rates will not allow Europe to prosper again, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough”, Lemel said to journalists.
“Germany needs to invest, and the sooner it needs to, the better. Don't wait until things get worse,” he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on several occasions.
This year, France has implemented tax cuts of over €10 billion, which have greatly boosted its economic growth.
The global economy had lost its dynamism and the German economy, which was dependent on exports, had borne the brunt.
Le Mel noted that next year the tax burden on French families will be reduced by €9.3 billion, including €5 billion in income tax relief.
In addition, as the corporate tax rate is gradually reduced from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a five-year period, the enterprise tax burden will be reduced by almost Euro1 billion.

Research: The U.S. National Healthy Diet Index has increased slightly, but still presents challenges - China Net
According to the U.S. News Network, a recent U.S. study recently showed a moderate increase in the U.S. Government's healthy diet index over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
This is not to be celebrated, however, with a 100-point mark.
American nationals continue to face “substantial challenges” in their diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fanfan, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University, Massachusetts, said that Americans still consume too much food that could cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity, which are the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published in the American Medical Association Journal in 24.
The study was based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the United States Government between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote that “despite significant improvements, there are significant dietary challenges”.
These challenges are known to include reducing the intake of foods containing saturated fat, such as snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter, etc., by United States nationals.
Research has found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people's daily diet has increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, exceeding the recommended 10 per cent limit.
The biggest improvement in America’s national diet is the drop in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
Officially, sugar-added intake should be less than 10 per cent in daily diets.
With regard to the reasons for the decline in sugar intake, researchers believe that it is associated with a reduction in the use of sweet soda, but Zhang Fong stresses that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
The intake of fruits, nuts, oatmeal and other all-grain food categories has increased slightly among adults in the United States.
However, data for 2016 show that these foods still account for less than 5 per cent of the daily diet.
Although the intake of salt has decreased slightly and the consumption of juice has led to the intake of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang aromatics indicate that they still account for up to 42 per cent of daily heat, many of which come from processed white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on biennial personal health surveys that remind adults of the food they have eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asked twice every few days since 2003.
The government has published a dietary guide for American residents that recommends a “healthy diet” to reduce the risk of chronic illness.
The guide states that people should consume more nutrient-intensive foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, thin meat, poultry meat, eggs and seed foods that can provide proteins.
At the time of the study, the number of people with diabetes in the United States almost doubled, to over 7%, and the obesity rate has also increased over the years – today about 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among United States nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnerships with Asia
The Forum was attended by members of the Central Political Bureau of the Viet Nam Communist Party, the Secretary of the Central Registry and the Minister of the Central Economy, Nguyen Wenping.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the Forum was “European Union-Asia twinning: building bridges for the future of sustainable development”.
The Forum took place one year after the implementation of the twinning strategy in the two continents of the European Union.
The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, stated that the strengthening of the interface was part of that idea, as it brought benefits to the peoples and economies of the countries concerned.
These relations have helped to bring stability and prosperity to all concerned.
At the same time, he believed that the European Union wanted to convey messages about increasing participation and consolidating mutually beneficial interfaces between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was a special guest at the Forum and will make an important presentation in the plenary.
The country's first stock-management subsidiary was set up to run the business with a technology enabler.
On 26 June, the Great China Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary, Qingdao Finance Limited, was inaugurated in Qingdao, the country's first joint-stock bank finance subsidiary.
The experts indicated that asset management was an important area for the development of financial science and technology and that the establishment of financial subsidiaries by banks facilitated their use of science and technology to upgrade their operations.
In April of this year, the Bank of Guang Da and the Caller Bank issued separate circulars stating that they had been approved by the China Silver Insurance Supervisory Board to prepare for the construction of the finance subsidiary.
On 24 September, Gwang Da Bank announced that it had been officially authorized to open its operations.
Just two days later, the Grand Bank led a number of stock-based banks and took the lead in the establishment of the Qingdao Bank.
The Chairman of the Big Light Group, Lee Xiaoping, said that the Big Light Group would accelerate the pace of innovation by using modern technological thinking and tools, relying on big data, object networking, cloud computing, increasing the coverage, utilization and penetration of financial capital, and improving client access, happiness and security.
By 2021, the establishment of the “Eight Pillar” for the sound development of financial science and technology in the country will further enhance the capacity of the financial sector to apply science and technology, achieve greater integration and coordinated development of finance and technology, and significantly increase the population's satisfaction with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Mr. Zhang Xuyang, Chairman of Xuyang's Finance Board, introduced that the financial platform for Xujiang would use such technologies as intellectual investment, intellectual investment, big data, etc. to help Quasi better manage the macroeconomic situation.
New technologies, such as block chains, will also be applied in the future to capture trends and trends from traditional to alternative to digitally alternative assets.
The Special Research Fellow of the National Laboratory for Finance and Development, Dong Xijin, stated that, in the face of a new competitive situation in the financial sector, financial science and technology companies and financial institutions would explore new growth paths using capital and technology together.
Financial science and technology enablers are both a need for financial science and technology to transform itself and, above all, will inject new dynamism and dynamism into the development of financial services.
At the beginning of this year, Kyoto Digital Science and Technology launched a new technology management system to upgrade the production research and development and wind control capabilities of the capital through technology and digitalization.
The new system builds on product design, sales transactions, asset management and risk assessment capabilities to enhance the overall intellectual performance of the industry.
It was felt that while upgrading client service capabilities and innovative products, S&T could also enhance risk preparedness and efficiency in managing for capital.
Zhang Xuyang indicated that while the risk preferences used to locate clients through questionnaires were prone to deviations, the current use of artificial intelligence for user drawings helped to better locate clients and to roll out products in line with their investment preferences and to mitigate risks.
"Alternative big data, such as electricity, space and space data, can help us better carve a region, an industry’s activity, and a landscape."
Zhang Xuyang said that, while addressing risks, big data technology would also help to improve wind control capabilities.
The deepest record of the Chinese railway tunnels has been updated.
After more than 1,200 days of day and night construction on the 27th of September (Jan Wei Ming, the nation's Chang Jianbo), the construction of the Grand (Li) Ri (Li) Railway's Santao tunnel, well No. 1, was completed on 27th. The well reached a depth of 762.59 metres below the ground, breaking China's deepest record of rail tunnels and wells, which were created in a flood of water.
The 34.5-kilometre-long Grand-Swee Railway Golligan Hill Tunnel, located in Yunnan, crosses the Golligan Mountains from the West Bank and is the longest double-line single-hole tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel runs through 19 fracture zones and is buried at a maximum depth of 1,155 metres, since it covers the undesirable geological and significant risks that may be encountered in the construction of almost all of the tunnels, known as the “Geological Museum” of the tunnel.
The erection of the wells is the most important auxiliary tunnel in the Goligon Hill Tunnel, with the important task of increasing the operational surface to achieve “silence” and later ventilation for railway operations.
The successful excavation of the first rig to the bottom of the well marks the construction of the formal entry-level tunnel at the Goligon Hill Tunnel, which, after the opening of the sub-drill and the replacement of equipment, could add four additional fields of operation to the well and speed up the opening of the tunnel.
“The wells are all over the granite layers, and, because of the fragmentation of the granite layers, they cannot stop the water, they keep flowing from the top to the bottom, and basically the depth of the wells is as high as the water pressure.”
The Chief Engineer of the Dare Railways Project of the Central Iron Tunnels Authority informed journalists that during the construction of the well, there had been a number of dangers, such as mud rushing and collapse, and that the builders had invited experts to take the pulse on site and over 20 discussions had been held on the treatment programme.
“The maximum influx of water in the wells amounts to more than 300 cubic metres per hour and more than 700 metres of the bottom of the well, with water pressure equal to 700 metres of the sea floor.”
"If we don't pump the drain in time, we'll flood the well 10 meters in an hour, we'll spend almost 85% of our time on water treatment, and 15% of our time on digging."
In order to overcome the geological difficulties of vertically controlled development of the rig 1 fence, slurry and water-rich granite, the tunnel construction was carried out using a combination of “exploration, injection and excavation” systems to treat water and reduce the risk of construction.
As a result of numerous improvements, the construction of rig 1 has resulted in a mechanized water flow line, such as an excavator system, a tremor system, a suspension system and a winch lift system, resulting in a full-process mechanized operation of eye beating, bursting, shattering, template installation and concrete construction, which has accelerated the construction process.
Ultimately, after more than 1,200 day and night works, the rig successfully completed the excavation at a depth of 762.59 metres.
The Grand Swe Railway, which is 330 kilometres long, is an important part of the international corridor in Central Myanmar and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the “one-way” construction.
With the construction of the bus, the travel time between Dalian and Reilly will be reduced from six hours to two hours on the current road, which will significantly improve transport patterns in the Farsi region and facilitate trade and trade cooperation between China and South-East Asian countries.
Lin Jung-seok: As a Chinese, he was proud of his country's achievements.
The Hong Kong press celebrates the 70th anniversary of the National Day.
“The Hong Kong press celebrates the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China”, 27 Hong Kong.
The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Lin Jung-hoon, in his speech at the wine conference, stated that the country's achievements over the past 70 years were well known and that we, as Chinese people, were proud.
Lun Ning, Deputy Director-General of the Central Government Liaison Office in Hong Kong; Song Hu An, Deputy Special Commissioner of the Royal Administration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Chen Yading, Deputy Political Commissioner of the Liberation Army Force in Hong Kong; and Kang Jing, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Hong Kong Press Committee for the celebration of the National Day were among the participants and guests.
In his message, Lin Jung-hoon noted that China, as a Chinese nation, is proud to have moved forward over the past 70 years and, even though it has faced many difficult challenges, has managed to overcome its excesses and its achievements are well known to the world.
Hong Kong's return to its homeland has been closely linked to the Mainland and has been working together to achieve fruitful results.
It is believed that under the premise of “one country, two systems”, Hong Kong will continue to have the advantage of taking advantage of the opportunities of the “one way” and the Great Bay of Australia in Hong Kong to find a better future for Hong Kong.
She added that over the past few months Hong Kong's social disputes had affected every Hong Kong citizen and that journalists faced different challenges.
At this critical juncture, it is to be hoped that friends of the press will continue to face up to the occasion, be professional, provide fair and balanced news coverage for the society and do their part for the future of Hong Kong, and for the community to resume its dialogue on rational communication.
In his message, Chon said that the glorious journey of the new China was also a journey of development, progress, blood ties, honour and dignity for Hong Kong and its motherland.
In particular, since the return of Hong Kong to its homeland, the Central Government has been steadfast in its approach of “one country, two systems”, “the Hong Kong people govern” and a high degree of self-government.
To that end, the Hong Kong press gathered to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
He stated that over the past three months, there had been a series of violent acts in flagrant violation of the law and wanton destabilization of society, which had been facilitated by the publication of distorted and false reports by some media outlets.
He called on the media to raise awareness and create a favourable climate for the population to resist violence and uphold the rule of law.
Professional media professionals are required to adhere to professional journalistic norms, use real reporting and responsible speech to guide citizens towards self-awareness and violence, and uphold the fairness and supremacy of the law.
Some 500 people from all walks of life, including the Hong Kong press, attended the wine fair and joined the guest of honour in a toast to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The journalist learned from the Sining City Council's Advocacy Department that the City of Sining will be implementing the Regulation on the Promotion of Civilization in the City of Sining on 1 October, focusing on 15 uncivil behaviour types, such as pedestrians not following traffic lights and throwing objects out of buildings, setting out a list of priority governance issues and imposing appropriate penalties.
Wang Xingbin, Deputy Minister of Communication and Director of the City Civilization Department of the Sinning City Council, introduced the marked improvement in the culture and morality of civil civilization since the city was recognized as the nation's civilized city in 2017.
However, uncivil behaviour such as pedestrians crossing the streets, breaking through red lights, non-motorized vehicles not following traffic lights, high-altitude objects, window objects, smoking in public places, walking dogs in public places and allowing local defecation is still prominent and easy to rebound and needs to be addressed as soon as possible.
In conjunction with Sinning's reality, the regulations impose more comprehensive and higher standards on the norms of civilized conduct of individuals and units, from public places, public order, public facilities, public sanitation, civilized travel, civilized tourism, civilized access to the Internet, the building of civilized campuses, the promotion of civilized families, the performance of public functions, the commemoration of heroic martyrs, medical services, etc., so that society as a whole understands what can be “advocacy” and what is “prohibited”.
“Promote regulations to eliminate blind spots and misperceptions in the area of awareness of civilized behaviour, and provide a strong legal guarantee for the normalization of the work of popular spiritual civilization in the city of Sinning by providing comprehensive regulations on citizens’ behaviour, homekeeping, meals, travel, education, tourism, Internet access, green life, wedding funerals, etc.”
The Secretary-General of the General Committee of the Sinning City People's Congress said that it was against Huai Jun.

The British tourist car keys fell into the lake, and the whole family was trapped in France for five days.
In recent days, a couple from Wales, England, took two children on vacation to France and accidentally threw the car keys into the lake. The family was forced to wait five days to get the new keys from the car manufacturer.
The couple then left France with the children.
It was reported that on 16 September local time, when the British family was looking at a lake in France, her daughter accidentally knocked over a bag and the keys to the car in it fell into the lake.
But they took hours and couldn't find the keys.
And all their possessions and cash are locked in the car.
Although British tourists purchased insurance prior to their departure, the insurance company refused to help on the grounds that the vehicle was not in danger of being stolen.
They had to hire a trailer to pull it into a garage and store it, and then reorder the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally obtained the key to the formulation and the couple left France with the children.
They were forced to cancel their scheduled journey because of the loss of car keys.
Saudi Arabia officially liberalized tourist visas for 49 countries, including China.
Since that date, the Kingdom has officially liberalized tourist visas for 49 countries, including China, at a total cost of SAR 440 (approximately RMB 836).
Visitors are required to prepare a medical insurance covering Saudi territory and to apply for an address in Saudi territory.
Visitors may apply for landing at the airport after landing, or for electronic signing through the service.visitsaudi.com.
Of these, the electronic signature is multiple entry for one year, allowing tourists to stay for up to 90 days.
For ordinary tourists, Saudi Arabia is the most mysterious country, as it has never issued a tourist visa.
In recent years, Saudi Arabia has promoted the “Vision 2030” plan, led by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with the aim of reducing the country's long-term dependence on oil, with the liberalization of tourism and the development of tourism as important components.
The Deputy Prime Minister of Belarus, Igor Liashenko, undertook a working visit to the province of Hing An, Viet Nam.
During the meeting, the Secretary of the Committee for Hing-an Province, Mr. Duzhing, highlighted the remarkable achievements of Belarus in industrial production and the investment of Belarusian enterprises in Hing-an Province.

Pilot system of notification of commitments in areas such as licensing of food production for low-risk varieties, decentralization of foreign business representation to self-trade zones
On 27 September, the Shanghai Municipal Market Regulatory Authority signed a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Pudong Novi District to introduce 20 market regulatory reform measures, some of which were pilot projects throughout the country.
It was stated that the notification of an undertaking referred to the fact that the administrative authorities, in matters relating to the registration of permits, had informed the applicant in writing of the conditions and requirements set out in the laws and regulations.
Once the applicant has signed a promise, the administrative authorities can do so directly.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority will support the registration of business names in the Pudong New Zone and the Shanghai Free Trade Pilot Area, permit the production of simple, low-risk food varieties, and inform commitment systems in three areas, such as partial metrology equipment type approval, to facilitate business access.
The Shanghai Xin Wan Food Company, 27, obtained on-the-spot Food Production Licences by means of a promise notification, becoming the first company to benefit from the pilot dividend.
The head of the business said that food permits could also be obtained on the spot, and that the “admissibility” approach, which allowed the enterprise to submit part of the information in accordance with the deadline agreed upon in the letter of commitment, was “really perceived as facilitating the reform.”
The Shanghai market regulator indicated that the system of notification of food production licences was a national pilot.
As a result of the reform, the processing process was reduced from six previously “Registration, Reception, On-Site Verification, Sample Examination, Examination of Materials, Approval of Documents” to three “Registration, Reception, Approval of Documents”, with the completion time being reduced from 20 working days prior to the reform to immediate closure.
Taking into account the high outward orientation of the Pudong economy, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority has delegated the registration of permanent representatives of foreign (regional) enterprises to the Shanghai Free Trade Area to facilitate the proximity of enterprises.
Statistics show that the decentralization involved a total of 1,592 permanent representative institutions in the Shanghai Free Trade Area, of which 99 were processed in accordance with the new regulations.
“11” Long-term fake consumer survey: choice of more diversity, tourism first.
The long holidays for the National Day are approaching, and people's vacation plans are gradually being finalized.
Nearly 20 feedbacks received from the Daily Securities journalist recently launched a small survey in the circle of friends on the “XI” holiday arrangements show that, while the plans vary, “tourism + consumption” becomes the key word for the “XI” holiday.
Specifically, more than half of the respondents to the Daily Securities Journal chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said that “the XI period was planned to take his family to Shanghai, while Mr. Disney was the first stop and then went to the surrounding cities”; Ms. Lee, who was in Beijing, chose to travel to Taiwan, “a family that left on September 28, plans to travel the island for 10 days”; Ms. Ma, Chongqing, planned to travel abroad, with Singapore as its destination; Mr. Zhang and his family in Hebei chose to travel on their own, saying that “the daughter is less than two years old, it is not easy to go away, she plans to travel to Shandong on her own for a few days at sea”.
A recent report on the trends of residents travelling and travelling on the Golden Week of 2019, published jointly with the same tour, shows a clear upward trend in consumption in the three subsectors of travelling, living and travelling on the Golden Week of the National Day this year.
There has been a steady increase in the penetration rate of aircraft, high-iron travel and an increase in the demand for star hotels and personalized unmarked accommodation.
On 23 September, the United States Mission published a report on trends in tourism consumption on the occasion of the 2019th anniversary, which showed that tourism consumption continued to flourish and showed an upward trend in “live-in” diversification.
More young people travel in favour of high-quality and distinctive experiences, and cultural tourism, night tourism, etc., continue to increase in heat.
In addition to tourism, various types of consumption demand were released centrally during the “XI” period.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the daily Securities Journal reporter, “The main plan of this year’s ‘XI’ is to buy a car.”
The staff of a Beijing car brand 4S shop said to the Daily Securities Reporter that, in general, September and October of each year were referred to as the golden period for the sale of cars.
During the “XI” period, a number of activities will be launched, such as drawings, placements, etc.
A number of brands have also recently introduced new models, and it is expected that the boost to sales of new products will be more visible.
In the context of rising consumption trends, greater attention is being paid to the need to meet the spiritual dimension, and the share of services, such as culture and education, is rising.
Ms. Dou, who lives in Beijing, said that “since the birth of a child, culture, education and consumption have become the bulk of household consumption expenditure.
This year’s ‘11’ is full, going to the ‘Catch Card’ Planetarium, the Children’s Theatre, a few family weekends to camp in tents at the Elk Museum, and some experimental lessons.”
According to the industry, in theory, the population's consumption is escalating along the path of subsistence consumption towards developmental consumption and enjoyment, with a large share of the enjoyment consumption falling within the category of service consumption.
As our economy continues to grow and the income level of our population rises, there is an increasing focus on consumption demand at the spiritual level, and tourism and travel are a good way to proceed.
In particular, the long holiday of the Eleventh National Day, which was more than sufficient in time, and the fact that people were more willing to travel and consume, was a reflection of both the spiritual demand for consumption and the rising consumption of the population.
The afternoon began to be lonely and reluctant to go out, and the children have not yet been brought to terms with their absence.
Get a hold of yourself and say to the dog, "Mom took you out."
He wrote a few details about the things he had to do, and the character of type A blood was getting stronger and he felt uncomfortable.
Take the suit, buy the nutrients, pay, buy the raw fish, the Nana snacks.
That's the reason for going out.
On the phone, thanks to the fact that she was in love with her sister, there was no excuse to buy snacks.
They laughed a couple of times and said the kid was on the phone and hung up.
Nana jumps on the sidewalk and falls down honestly. She knows she's sick, scared and unwilling to stay with me.
Her husband, Boo, came back early.
Even the salads of the salmon mixed with butter and fruit are good, and then go to the bedroom and watch TV on the bed.
A glance at the wall, just at 7 p.m., the sun sets early in the sunrise and it is dark.
The month was invented in the circle of friends, and today is Mid-Autumn.
Washed a bunch of grapes from a friend, left half to Boo, and left it in a little flower bowl that I liked and took out to see the moon.
And Nana sat on the ground, and she ate grapes, and she ate skins, and I vomited grape seeds far away.
And the moon is hidden in the clouds, so that they walk away, and the moon will suddenly appear, and the darkness will be dazzled.
The poems about the moon are rife in the brain, and it is only clear to like it: every three or five times a week / a round of clean protection of the jade fence / a round of the sky / a crowd of people looking up their heads.
Perhaps we have given the moon too much emotion. For me now, in fact, the word of God belongs to God, and Caesar to Caesar is the best.
The moon goes to the moon, your emotions go to you.
After eating the grapes, it's cold and cold.
The Nana Regiment snored slightly by its feet, stood up and laid Nana's little blanket over her little house, and Nana was happy to lie on it.
Open the door and shout: "Are the baths burned?
The windows in the bathroom do not look at the moon. They can only feel the moon, turn off the lights in the bathroom and lift the glass.
No mooncakes, no drinks.
A mascot was released at Dubai Expo 2020.
The 2020 Dubai Expo mascot launch ceremony was held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
The mascot consists of six cartoon images, including two Emirates children, three flying robots and a United Arab Emirates bean tree.
The launch presented information on six mascots to the audience through video clips.
A 9-year-old boy, Rashid, and an 8-year-old girl, Latifa, are brothers and sisters, representing the people of the United Arab Emirates.
Three robots correspond to the three sub-themes of the Expo, blue robots for "mobility", green robots for "sustainability", yellow robots for "opportunity".
An ancient bean tree named "Salama" is the "grandmother" of five little boys, symbolizing the ancestors who defended the land.
Ahmad, Chairman of the Dubai High Council of Expo, said that mascots could strengthen emotional ties between large-scale events and participants, “be sure that the mascots of the Dubai Expo will convey the traditional spirit of storytelling, demonstrate the creativity of indigenous talent and express our ambitions and expectations.”
The launch was attended by the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, Chief Mohammed of Dubai, Crown Prince Hamdan of Dubai, the Minister of State for International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates and the Director of the Dubai World Bureau, Lim Hashimi.
The Dubai Expo will be held in Dubai from 20 October 2020 to 10 April 2021, on the theme “Communicating ideas for a future”.
This will be the first World Expo to be held in the Middle East region.
Starting next year, Chinese students can apply for German undergraduate studies on the basis of a high school exam.
In recent days, the Anabin database of Germany, which is responsible for the assessment and certification of foreign qualifications, announced on the Network that, starting in 2020, Chinese high school graduates can apply directly for undergraduate studies at German universities on the basis of a higher examination, without first having to enrol at domestic universities.
Prior to that, Chinese high school graduates who wanted to apply for German universities had to study one semester (211,985) or three semesters (general undergraduate) in their country, and passed the APS or Testas examination.
The publication of the new regulations may save Chinese students who wish to study in Germany at least six months.
It was informed that the new regulation would enter into force in the second half of 2019.
Applicants are required to complete 12 years of regular compulsory education and to obtain a high school diploma; to take part in the examination, the higher examination, with grades of 70% and above of the total score (up to 525 points if a total score of 750 points) and include two language and one mathematics or natural science achievement requirements.
In addition, the requirements for performance in higher examinations vary from one profession to another.
For example, applications for specializations in medicine, oral medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacology, etc., require a full score of 80% for higher examinations, and must include mathematics, physics, chemistry, at least two in organisms, or participation in higher studies; applications for higher examinations require a full score of 80% for higher studies in the legal category, and must include foreign languages, history, at least two in geography, or participation in higher studies.
According to incomplete statistics, several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, have now endorsed China's performance in the high examination.
In the United Kingdom, for example, institutions of higher learning such as Cambridge University, Birmingham University and Leicester University accept applications from Chinese students for admission on the basis of a higher examination.
Military "Machine Dogs" will begin with acting classes.
The U.S. Army has funded the development of a "machine dog" for the battlefield, and may be on the circus stage now!
The Sun Circus has recently indicated that it is in contact with Boston Dynamics, which develops robots, to discuss the feasibility of robot applications for circus performances.
In a comprehensive external report, Boston Power Technology published a promotional film on 24 April entitled “Spot, a four-foot robot”, which shows Spot as an agile mobile robot with a 14-kilogram capacity with high mobility to cross-country terrain, 360-degree avoidance functions, navigation, remote control and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has exclusive software platforms specifically developed for Spot, and users can customize Spot robotic functions through various applications.
Boston Dynamics published the idea of a machine dog for the first time in 1992, when it caused a great deal of excitement, but it has still not really been put into commercial use.
However, according to Boston Dynamics, Spot is now in the mass production phase, with a majority of buyers predominantly in the construction and energy industries.
In addition, the Sun Circus is currently in contact with Boston Power Technology, which says that the scheme is still in the conceptual stage and is assessing the potential of Spot to be used at the performance site.
The State Council's Press Office issued a white paper entitled China and the World in a New Era.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Press Office of the State Council issued a White Paper entitled " China and the World in a New Era " on 27th.
The Vice-Minister of China and Chief of the Press Office of the State Council said that the White Paper focused on “Where China comes from and where it goes” and “What a world China promotes” and “How a developing China can live with the world”, and systematically described China's development achievements, its path and its course of development, as well as China's relations with the world, with a view to improving the international community's understanding and understanding of China's development.
According to the White Paper, over the past 70 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has undergone dramatic changes that have created a miracle of development unprecedented in human history, especially since the Party's eighteenth anniversary, which has witnessed historic achievements and transformations in China's development.
Through a wealth of data and facts, the White Paper presents the great achievements, significance and world contribution of China's development over the past 70 years.
According to the White Paper, China had spent decades completing the development journey that had been carried out by the developed countries for centuries. The economy was the second largest in the world. Nearly 1.4 billion people had emerged from material shortages and had generally attained a level of well-being and enjoyed unprecedented dignity and rights.
The White Paper emphasized that for 70 years, the Chinese people had come home with nothing, self-reliance and hard work and had made a new reality; for 70 years, China had developed in its interaction with the world, embracing the world, learning it and contributing to it; and for 70 years, China had made a contribution to world peace and had given impetus to the common development of all nations.
The White Paper stated that China's development had been successful over the past 70 years because, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people had found the right path to development, the socialism of the Chinese identity, and were steadfast in their pursuit of that path.
The White Paper emphasized that China's unique socialist path was a path based on national circumstances, a path that placed the interests of the people first, a path of reform and innovation, a path to common development in openness and a path to a State based on the rule of law in all its aspects.
This path of development in China is in line with China's national circumstances and will be adapted to the requirements of the times and will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
In response to the concerns of the international community with regard to China's development, the White Paper stresses that achieving the country's prosperity, national revitalization and the well-being of its people is both a dream of the Chinese people and a common dream of all peoples.
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of economic growth in the world. Openness in all its aspects creates more opportunities for development in all countries. China provides the international community with more public goods. China's development provides experience and lessons for other developing countries. China must not follow the path of “big power”.
Faced with the question of “What the world is about, what humanity is about”, the White Paper states that today's world is in the midst of a century of great change and that human society is both hopeful and challenging.
China's initiative to build a community of human destinies and to open up new avenues for development that cooperate in win-win and shared development offers new options for human development.
The White Paper called on States to unite in building a new form of international relations, to promote a new globalization of the economy, to preserve the international system with the United Nations at its core, to promote the exchange of ideas among civilizations and to contribute together to building a community of human destinies and a better world.
With the growing development of China, the international community is generally concerned about how developing China can live with the world.
The White Paper states that China cannot develop without the world and that it cannot develop and prosper peacefully.
China has always placed its own development in the system of coordinates of human development. China is committed to cooperation and win-win development. China is committed to maintaining and promoting economic globalization. It is committed to developing a global partnership. China firmly supports multilateralism, upholds international justice and equity. China is committed to building a “one-way” high-quality development. China is actively involved in leading the reform and construction of the system of global governance. It has always been a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a guardian of the international order.
At present, China's development has entered a new era.
The White Paper states that China in the new era will not change its determination to follow the path of socialism characterized by China, that it will not change its determination to learn from each other and to work together to win, and that it will not change its determination to work with the world.
The White Paper concluded by stating that the future of nations in today's world has never been as closely linked as it is now.
The White Paper " China and the World in a New Era ", consisting of forewords, texts and closing words, contains more than 29,000 words.
The White Paper was published in eight languages: C, E, F, R, D, S, A, D, and D, respectively, by the People's Press and the Foreign Press, and was distributed at the National Xinhua Bookshop.
Will Marv be elected to a by-election at a conference in Denver, Joffrey State?
The President of the Ma'am, Mr. Datos Li, said, "The Supreme Council of the National Front is ready to discuss it!"
In the immediate run-up to the Danish-Ai by-election, it was a matter of concern whether Ma Wah, a member of the National Front party, would take up the traditional national seat.
However, following the meeting of the CMC, it was announced that it would be left to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether the traditional Mawar seat would continue to be taken over by the Mawar or by the other members of the party.
On Thursday afternoon, after chairing the meeting of the Madhua Central Committee, he indicated to the media that any by-election would be conducted in accordance with the standard operating procedures (SOP), i.e., only after a meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front.
He said that since the Election Commission would meet only next Monday (1 January) to finalize the By-elections for the Danfumi State Seat, it was expected that the meeting of the Supreme Council of the Fretilin would take place in early October.
“Tomorrow yesterday morning, I also met with the President of the National Front, Dato’s Amalzahi, and we all agreed on the need to regain this seat from the Alliance of Hope.”
“We have finalized a meeting of the leaders of the Special National Front in early October, where the leaders of the three parties of the National Front will determine which of the member parties will take part.”
Asked if Mawar would insist on standing before the Supreme Council of the NFL as a traditional seat, Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that, as Chairman of the GFMD, he must act in accordance with the standard operating procedures and that any decision must therefore be taken by consensus of the NFL.
“In any by-election, it is common for people to be willing to march, for political parties and for parties to think that they should come out.”
“What organization and political alliance do we come from?”
“This is a test of our political union over the years, and we believe that the National Front has come along with some valuable values.”
“In this process, someone may say something, which is not surprising.”
“But once the Supreme Council of the NFL has made a decision, we must all be ready to fight, which is the most valuable.”
In any event, Wei Jiaxiang indicated that Ma Wah would make every effort at three levels, namely, district councils, state boards and the central level, to prepare for the forthcoming by-election for the Danish-Ai seat.
“The district council is led by the chairman of the regional council (Danfé Bie) with the head of the regional council with the head of the regional council with the head of the central council with the head of the council of Juju with the head of the head of the head of the council with the head of the council with the head of the central board with the head of the board with the head of the board with the head of the head of the board with the head of the board with the head of the board with the head of the head of the board with the head of the department with the head of the department with the head of the department with the head of the department with the head of the department with the head of the department with the head of the department with the head of the department with the head of the department with the head of the department with the head of the department with the head of the department with the head of the department.
Last Saturday (21st), Congressman Danfly of the Indigenous Solidarity Party, Nadhu Mohammed Fari, died of heart problems in a government hospital in stupid Jane, 42 years old.
A villager in Paikang County, Hubei, was ordered to “compulsory patrol the mountains” for hunting wildlife.
A villager in Paikang County, Hubei, was sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to compensate him for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources in the amount of 15420 yuan (RMB).
Due to the poverty of the families of the accused, the Public Prosecution Service has introduced alternative forms of labour to compensate for the cost of ecological rehabilitation, which has resulted in an organic harmonization of legal and social effects.
On 27 September, Wang Chong Liang, Deputy Attorney-General of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Prefectural District, explained that, through three months of alternative labour, such as “compulsory cruises”, the accused had established deep feelings with wild monkeys and was deeply responsible for previous hunting of animals.
On 21 June of this year, the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Prefectural District of Paikang filed a civil pro bono lawsuit in the area of ecological resources, which was heard in the district court and handed down in court.
The accused was sentenced to three years'imprisonment on Monday, four years'probation and a fine of $3,000, and was ordered to compensate him for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources in the amount of $15420.
According to the survey, starting in late January 2014, power grids were installed on the cliffs, hunting for more than 20 wildlife species, including falcons, pelicans, fur crown deer, etc.
The falafel is a secondary endangered wildlife conservation animal in the country, and the puppies and fur crowning deer are listed in the National List of Wildlife Conservation on Land.
During the trial, each week confessed to his or her wrongs and conduct and was willing to assume subsidiary civil liability.
However, in view of the poor economic situation of a certain family in the past week, the local village council, the forest station and the local district prosecutor's office, in coordination with the local district prosecutor's office, entered into an agreement on the cost of alternative labour compensation for ecological rehabilitation: the provision of public services to cover the cost of ecological restoration through the practice of salvaging monkeys in the village's monkey reserve for a period of one year.
In response to the prosecutor's recommendation, the Court accepted that the obligation of “alternative labour to compensate for ecological restoration costs” should be actively met while the suspended sentence was imposed on a weekly basis.
At present, Monday has three months of compulsory work in the Monkey Reserve, and the cruises have been positive and performing well.
In recent years, the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Prefectural District of Pavcon has integrated in practice the functions of the public prosecutor and the conduct of social governance, using scientific methods of supervision, such as prosecutorial advice, investigative supervision and procedural supervision, in order to minimize the damage caused to the environment by criminal acts through judicial means.
United Nations award of the Earthguard prize for the ant forest
In a warm round of applause and resounding music, the head of the “Ant Forest” project, Xu Dhai, and the user representative Shen Xiao Liang, went to the podium and received from the moderator the 2019 United Nations “Guardian of the Earth” award.
The Earthguard award ceremony, held in New York, United States of America, in 2019, awarded the “Incentives and Action” award for the ant forest project, a small mobile phone program that engages hundreds of millions of people in environmental action.
A week earlier, the United Nations Environment Programme had announced a list of winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but it was still difficult for those who had attended the ceremony.
In an interview with a Xinhua journalist, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Ingae Anoxen, said that the Ant Forest was an exciting innovation that had mobilized hundreds of millions of people to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans could do about the environment.
It connects people and the environment with technology and allows each individual to participate in actions to protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.
The Ant Forest was launched in August 2016 by the ants Financial Services Group of China (the " ant gold suit " ) on a payout platform, where users accumulated "green energy" through low-carbon actions such as recording their daily green travels in the ant forest, online payments for electricity and water, and "plant trees" on their mobile phones.
Each time a user grows a virtual tree, the ant forest and a public good partner plant a real tree in a deserted area.
As of August of this year, 500 million “ant forest” users have collectively reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in areas of desertification.
In the same day, Costa Rica won an award for national environmental efforts, and Costa Rica's President Carlos Alvarado praised the contribution of the Ant Forest on the spot, “with the impressive ability to inspire so many people to participate in green action.”
The President and Chief Executive Officer of the ants' Golden Clothes said that the Earthguard Award was an affirmation of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible to engage in low-carbon life, an honour that belongs to all participants.
According to Ii Kenjung, the ant forest has affected 500 million people over the past three years, and the objective of the ant forest over the next three years is to engage 1 billion people globally in low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase farmers'income from green water in the mountains.
In addition to providing employment through tree planting, it is hoped that farmers will be helped to achieve higher incomes through agricultural development projects, electric power platforms, etc.
The public interest environmental model created by the Ant Forest, based on digital technology, has also been successful in reaching the sea and has been replicated in other countries.
Last June, the largest electronic wallet in the Philippines, GCash, launched the Philippine version of the Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon livelihoods.
It was stated that GCash, in partnership with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, the Environmental Public Interest Organization and others, was planning to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the start-up of the project.
The Earthguard Award is the highest United Nations award in the field of environmental protection and is awarded annually.
“Ant Forest” was awarded the “Incentive and Action Award” from China for the third consecutive year of the Green Innovation Project from China, following the construction by China of the Sihan Dam Forest Project and the “Kill Village Demonstration and Village Rehabilitation” project in Zhejiang Province, China.
Trade friction affects the United States economy's “report card”.
The United States “records” of the economy in the second quarter of this year showed a marked slowdown in the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States as compared to the previous quarter, as a result of a significant decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts pointed out that the economic and trade friction and the uncertainty it created were the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data published by the United States Department of Commerce on 26 February show that US GDP grew by 2 per cent at annual rates in the second quarter, which is the same as the previously published revised data, but is significantly lower than 3.1 per cent in the first quarter.
The data show that consumer growth is a major factor underpinning the growth of the United States economy in the second quarter.
Individual consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the total United States economy, increased by 4.6 per cent in the current season, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government spending on consumption and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment declined by 6.3 per cent in the second quarter over the previous quarter, delaying growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports by 5.7 per cent over the previous quarter; and net exports by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, managing partner for the macroeconomic consulting firm in Ainside, United States, stated that private sector investment had not kept pace with last year's growth, but had declined significantly because of the impact on business confidence caused by economic friction and rising uncertainty.
Knap believes that, under the influence of policy uncertainty, corporate capital spending in the United States is expected to continue to decline in the coming year.
According to analysts, while consumption growth has strongly supported the United States economy in the second quarter, there are increasing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty that they bring have affected consumer confidence and negatively affected the United States consumption prospects.
The head of the survey, Richard Courting, Professor of Economics at the University of Michigan, had recently stated that, in a recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers had referred spontaneously to the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, which was a new high in a year and a half.
For future economic trends in the United States, analysts generally agree that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, the view was also expressed that the performance of the United States industrial sector and financial markets would improve if economic friction were eased.
In the future, the United States economy is expected to continue its downward trend since this year, with a much lower rate of growth than in the second quarter.
Moody’s chief economist, Mark Zandy, predicts that the US economy will grow 2.3% this year, further slowing to 1.6% next year, assuming that economic friction will not continue to escalate.
Ellen Hazen, the investment manager of Patnam Investment Corporation, noted that the greatest concern of current enterprises was the economic and trade dispute and the uncertainty it created, which, if resolved, would be significantly reduced and the industrial sector would perform much better than it is today.
According to Matt Melley, the stock strategist of Miller-Tabak Asset Management, trade friction remains a “first issue” and is the main cause of significant volatility in US capital markets this year, and whether it can be properly addressed will be key to influencing the direction of US capital markets for the rest of the year.
The first couple in Ningxia can take 10 days of parental leave per year for children between 0 and 3 years of age.
Guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important sign of the progress of civil society.
On 27 September, at the fifteenth meeting of the twelfth session of the Standing Committee of the Ningxia Autonomous Community, the Regulations on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in the Ningxia Axis Autonomous Region were adopted with a high vote.
This is the local regulation issued by the first province of Ningxia on the comprehensive and systematic defence of the legitimate rights and interests of women, which will be fully implemented as of 1 November 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations adopted on this occasion were amended on the basis of the 2007 Ningxia Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women, and were divided into nine chapters, 65 articles, including general provisions, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, labour and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, rights and interests of the marital family, legal responsibilities and by-laws.
In the Ordinance, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave for couples, which was the first in the country.
In April of this year, the Office of the State Council issued guidance on promoting the development of childcare services for children under three years of age.
In the course of the revision of the Ordinance, Ningxia introduced an innovative proposal to “encourage employers to grant 10 days of joint parental leave each year between the ages of 0 and 3 for couples with children in accordance with the law and regulations”.
At the same time, the Ordinance highlights the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative results in China's current civil code on personality rights, and details the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms against sexual harassment, etc.
Section 44 of the Ordinance expressly prohibits the frequent incidence of sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to undertake relevant educational, protective and preventive work as a new standard for the protection of girls in local legislation.
With regard to the right of women to know and dispose of the common property of the matrimonial family, article 35 of the Ordinance clearly establishes the right of women to know the joint property and the obligations of the property register and related entities, and provides a solid institutional support for women's rights.
Moreover, in response to the social issue of gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Ordinance prohibits not only direct discrimination, but also indirect discrimination, and draws on the latest experience of joint interview practice to strengthen penalties for gender-based discrimination violations and to strengthen the protection of women's legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the work of the Ningxia Women's Union, the Department of Public Prosecutions and the Civil Administration, among others, in promoting and introducing the participation of social and professional forces in the mediation of marital and family disputes and in the fight against domestic violence has been very effective.
This is summarized and promoted by the Regulations, which, in a number of articles, encourage the mobilization of social forces, the pooling of social resources and the defence of women's rights and interests, and require the people's governments at and above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support, including through the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia, the UNITA Yuanlong Pilgrim Station is resistant to saline rice acre production of a kilogram of rice.
The journalist was informed by the UNITA Administration Administration of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on 27th that the “Saline-resistant rice site of the UNITA Yuan Long Pyre Station” recently held by the Alliance had been uploaded with good news that the average acre production of saline rice had broken down by 1,000 kilograms.
A team of six experts from the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences of Heilongjiang Province, Yangzhou University and the Rural Department of Hunan Province conducted on-site sampling and harvesting of “salt series” rice.
According to expert assessment, the average acre production of saline rice amounted to 508.8 kg on a pH value of 8.8 to 9.6, with salt content of 5 to 6 per 1,000.
“We intend to build on this year’s experiments and to innovate, as well as reform, so that salt-resistant rice varieties can be cultivated and optimized again, so that they can be of better quality and yield better.”
“In the absence of any change in the factors of production, I believe that increasing technological efforts will continue, and salt-resistant rice will continue to produce miracles on the saline.”
UNITA is part of a conglomerate of special hardship areas.
In October 2018, Yuan Long Pilgrim worked for UNITA to show up.
Master Yuan led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction of the newly developed “salin-resistant hybrid rice” varieties and advanced technologies, build 960 acres of salin-resistant rice bases in the right-wing flag of Koryu, use side-test demonstration, and promote technological routes to boost the productivity of the local poor and lift them out of poverty.
This on-site production of salt-resistant rice not only injects hope into the upgrading of UNITA salt-based low- and medium-yielding fields to middle- and high-yielding fields, but also provides a scientific basis for the cultivation of saline rice under the same conditions in our country.
The new Australian state passed the legalisation of abortion bill on 26 September, local time, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests, as reported by the Australian Network.
It is known that the bill has generated political debate over the past eight weeks and that there have been serious differences within the AFP since the introduction of the bill by an independent member of Parliament, Greenwich.
It was reported that, after nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australasia Senate passed the legalisation of abortion bill by 26 votes to 14, on the night of 25, making it the third-long bill to be considered by the new State Senate.
In the morning, after a final vote in the House of Representatives of the new Länder, abortion was legalized in the new Länder.
The Act allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy on the 22nd week of pregnancy and, with the consent of two doctors, to have an abortion later in pregnancy.
An amendment was adopted by the Senate on the evening of 25 September whereby doctors can seek advice from the multidisciplinary team of the Hospital Advisory Board before performing an abortion for a woman who is 22 weeks pregnant.
In addition, the amendments adopted by the Senate included the need for doctors to provide appropriate care for babies surviving after termination of pregnancy.
Previously, the Governor of the new state, Beridgeklain, had faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill, and she had intervened on several occasions to secure more time for debate on the bill, but she had not been present at the final vote.
"I need time to run the whole new state."
Congressman Davis of the AFP was known to have been the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatened to withdraw from the new state government and claimed that the bill had triggered a “government crisis”.
But then Davis gave in.
Davis said: “The content of the amendment to the bill on the legalization of abortion submitted to the House of Representatives in the morning of 26 actually provides more guarantees for women, doctors.”
At the same time, Bari Laro, leader of the New Australian National Party, said that he was proud to be a member of the Government that legalized abortion.
“What we achieved last night is historic for the new state, which legalizes abortion, which is no longer a crime, nor does it treat abortion women as criminals.”
Three groups of major projects are located on the mainland.
A total of 15 billion yuan has been invested, focusing on the development of oil-smart equipment and the intelligent steel industry.
Today, a signing ceremony for the project was held between the People's Government of the city of Changzhou and the Trinity Group.
Three groups have invested $15 billion in industrial projects such as the intelligent steel industry, oil-smart equipment and regional research and development centres (headquarters bases) and the second-hand car market for engineering machinery in Changzhou, where combined production is expected to exceed $200 billion a year.
The Trinity Iron and Steel Industry Project, with a total investment of $10 billion, will focus on creating the largest steel and product trading centre throughout the province and in the centre, as well as the Trinity Group Smart Manufacturing Centre for Metal Structures; the Oil Smart Equipment and Regional Research and Development Centre (HQ) project, with a total investment of $5 billion, will identify clear ponds and will focus on building oil intelligence equipment production bases and building regional R&D centres and headquarters bases.
At the same time, the Trinity Group will build a second-hand market for engineering machinery at the Carbine Park in Changzhou, where practical cooperation will take place in areas such as smart manufacturing.
The city attaches great importance to cooperation with the Triad Group.
The city has listed the cooperation project as “Project 1”, which is a city-wide call for investment this year. The city's secretary, Maoteng Fei, the mayor of Yang Wei, has taken the lead in setting up a special coordination group to effectively interface, promote high-level and provide high-quality and efficient services for the development of the Trinity Group settlement, from the point of contact to the formal signing of the cooperation agreement, for less than 100 days.
Minister of Finance Liu Quin: 67 foreign companies and financial institutions have transferred $8.601 billion from the State to strengthen the Social Security Fund.
The Minister of Finance, Liu Quin, stated on 27 September that, to date, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of part of the State capital enhancement social security fund, totalling approximately 86.1 billion yuan.
Liu Quin made the above statement at the deployment of the National Transfer Fund for the Financing of Social Security, which was co-sponsored by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Finance Committee on the same day.
“The transfer of a part of the State-owned capital enhancement fund is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system. It is an adequate reflection of universal access to the results of State-owned enterprise development and the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system. It is a current and long-term policy measure.”
In 2017, the State Council issued the Programme for the Implementation of the Fund for the Transfer of Partial State Capital for Social Security, which calls for the selection of selected central enterprises and selected provinces for piloting.
According to Liu Qun, the transfer process has yielded positive results.
At the central level, three batches of conversions of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have been completed, totalling approximately 86.1 billion yuan in State-owned capital.
Of these, the transfer of central financial institutions in which the Ministry of Finance performs the functions of funder has been largely completed.
Central business transfer is already on a certain scale.
At the local level, the pre-transfer of enterprises has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, pilot work had been largely completed in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces, transferring State-owned capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, preparatory work has been carried out successively in other provinces to prepare for the next transfer.
According to a joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the National Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration and the CVM, the central and local transfer of part of the State capital to the SWF was fully opened in 2019 and will be substantially completed by 2020.
The meeting that took place on that day resulted in a concrete deployment of the full roll-out.
The need for a pragmatic and efficient completion of the transfer was emphasized.
“According to the schedule, the transfer is to be substantially completed by 2020.
The transfer time is tight and the task is heavy."
Liu Quin said that the regions and sectors should be well organized and well organized to ensure that the transfer was completed as required; that the work was carried forward in a solid manner to accurately capture the content of the transfer policy; and that communication coordination should be strengthened to resolve difficult issues in a timely manner.
The transfer of state funds to the SWF – from the point of departure of the SWF money bag, the destination is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, in my view, this is not a simple “physical shift” of equity, but it opens the “mathematical addition”.
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human and Social Welfare, the State Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration and the CSRC jointly issued the Circular on the Full Transfer of Part of the State Capital for the Work of the Social Security Fund, setting out the timetable for the conversion of the State capital to the Fund, i.e. the Central and Local Transfer of Part of the State Capital for the Work of the Fund for Social Security, which was fully opened in 2019.
Once the documents are published, departments such as the Ministry of Finance are in place very quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 per cent of the holdings of business and industry banks and agricultural banks to the Social Security Fund, with a total transfer value of more than $115 billion.
Under the Act, subjects such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, are entitled to the proceeds, dispositions and information assigned to the State shareholdings.
In a public announcement, the trades and farmers stated that the change in interest would not result in a change in the shareholders and actual owners of their own holdings.
In this respect, it is my view that a similar transfer of State entrepreneurship is not a simple change in the attribution of equity, but a “additional calculation” that triggers a range of effects.
The first step of a partial national transfer of funds to social security is a “plus result” that naturally reflects the universal ownership of State-owned enterprises and the sharing of development results.
After many years of reform and development, State enterprises, in particular, are in most of the major sectors and areas of our economy, with greater and more stable overall profitability.
Among them, leading enterprises are more likely to achieve high performance on an ongoing basis.
On 10 July, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided that the transfer of part of the State capital to the SWF would be fully rolled out this year.
The Ministry of Finance then indicated that, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Committee of the State Council, it would complete the transfer of part of the State capital to the Social Security Fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the universal sharing of the results of State enterprise development.
The second step of the transfer, “plus results”, is to enhance the sustainability of our social security fund and further strengthen the foundations of the social security system for old age.
As a result of the ageing of the population, our social security funds are under pressure, and most of the national resources that have been transferred for this time have the capacity to sustain profits and dividends, not only to effectively replenish the social security funds, but also to provide a source of living water for the social security funds.
It has been calculated that for every 3.8 percentage points of State-owned capital transferred, the contribution rate of the enterprise's basic pension insurance can be supported by a reduction of one percentage point.
The third step of the transfer, "plus results", is to add stabilizers to capital markets.
The transfer recipient receives the proceeds by "primarily rededicated and operationally supported".
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor in State-owned capital, is indeed dominated by gains in equity dividends.
However, the Social Security Fund, as a value investor in capital markets, has a relatively strong capital working capacity.
For publicly listed assets of State capital, the participation of the Social Security Fund in the holding of shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, contribute to upgrading the level of business and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the increase in the weight of equity held by the Social Security Fund as a signpost for investment further enhances its influence in the market and acts as a “stabilizer” in the market.
It also facilitates the full realization of the “value discovery” function of institutional investors, leading them to invest rationally and in value.
Karl Hartmann was admitted to the Leipzig School of Music at the age of 18 and was later taught from Webhorn.
After the Nazis came to power, Hartmann first resisted in the form of works not published in Germany and then even stopped writing.
In 1933, he created Miserae and dedicated it to "my long-sleeping friends".
This symphony was inaugurated in Prague in 1935, but was harassed by Nazi bureaucrats.
After that, Hartmann was determined not to play any of his works under Nazi rule.
Hartmann's funeral concerto was a violin and string concerto, when the manuscript was stolen from Germany and its premiere was held in Switzerland.
Please listen to the funeral concert of the Berne House Orchestra at Beethoven Music Festival in 2018.
The United States Senate approved Scalia as Minister of Labour, Xinhuanet.
On September 26, Xinhua News, in Washington, D.C., the Senate of the United States Congress voted by President Trump to nominate Eugene Scalia as Minister of Labour.
The result was 53 votes in favour and 44 against, with no Democrats voting in favour of Scalia.
In the view of the Republicans, the curriculum vitae of Scalia makes him very suitable for the position of Minister of Labour.
However, in the view of the Democrats, Scalia has long been in opposition to workers and trade unions in the course of her career as a lawyer.
Scalia will replace Alexander Acosta.
Acosta, then Minister of Labour, resigned in July this year under great pressure from public opinion because he was accused of “massive treatment” of Jeffrey Eppstein, a billionaire in the United States suspected of sexual abuse and trafficking of young girls.
Scalia, aged 56, is a partner in a well-known law firm in the United States. His father is Antonin Scalia, the late Chief Justice of the United States Federal Supreme Court.
The Department of Labor is a cabinet-level department of the United States federal government responsible for labour-related matters, etc.
The White House also issued a statement on the same day that Trump had nominated Peter Guena, Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Measures Agency, to head the agency.
In accordance with the procedure, the nomination of Guéhenno must also be approved by the Senate of the National Assembly.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of the United States Department of Homeland Security, coordinates federal government resources to deal with and follow up on natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other emergencies in the United States.
Since the first military parade on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the National Day, each major military parade has seen the emergence of a strategic missile force with a “big no-man” front line.
“This national day is the first time that a rocket-propelled army has come to light after the ‘military’ turned into a ‘military’.’”
Wang Bo, the commander of the rocket-equipment unit, said.
The missile-visited forces are fully equipped with a particularly bitter, combatable and dedicated spirit, with intensive training, scientific organization and training throughout the course of military parades, reflecting three main features, a good image of strategic forces and a greater focus on hard practice.
During this military parade, both generals and soldiers, strict standards were required to create a culture of aggressiveness and prohibition.
They have also focused on the spirit of the craftsmen, grasping each detail, skill, perseverance and skill, forming the characteristics of “army positions, quick movement, good words” and constantly crafting a martial arts missile array, with a greater focus on scientific and technological innovation.
As a high-tech strategic army, the rocket army is a tradition and an advantage of science and technology and innovation.
This military parade, which builds on past experience, breaks the mindset and breaks the traditional approach by using advanced means such as satellite positioning, laser ranging, high-resolution imaging, real-time speed measurement, to upgrade the level and quality of training and to ensure that the human vehicle is integrated in milligrams, that the action of the teams is in short seconds, and that the standards of engagement are better matched.
The rocket forces were asked to adhere to the same standards and higher requirements as the military parade and launch sites, to hold every gate, to keep an eye on every detail, to keep the troops under fire, and to make the national parade truly a training ground and a test ground to enhance the force's ability to fight.
Iran has been confirmed to be developing advanced centrifuges to suspend further the implementation of the Iran nuclear agreement.
According to the “Central News Agency”, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on 26 September that Iran had once again violated its nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifugal mechanisms to enrich uranium.
Iran is reported to be gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran nuclear agreement in response to the withdrawal of United States President Trump from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018 and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran suspended two other commitments in July to keep its enriched uranium stock below 300 kg and to keep its enriched uranium purer than 3.67 per cent, and now moves further.
In accordance with the nuclear agreement, Iran has been able to build only about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, in addition to allowing Iran to use a small number of more advanced types of aircraft for research, but not to produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for use in the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
According to reports, the International Atomic Energy Agency report states: “On 25 September, the Agency confirmed that Iran's advanced centrifuges of type 2, 3 R & D are accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium.”
This report was presented to Member States on 26th by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and a diplomatic official responded: “They are busy at the Natanz enrichment facility.”
The Vietnamese Association of Investors and Entrepreneurs is officially visible.
Chen Hae-ling, President of the Viet Nam Investors and Entrepreneurs Association, said that VKBIA would work together as a bridge to strengthen inter-Korean relations.
The two countries aim to increase trade in both directions to $100 billion by 2020.
Mr. Chen Hae-ling believed that the creation of the Association was an important step towards that goal.
He hoped that the Viet Nam Party, the Government and relevant Korean functional agencies would assist in the future operation of the Association.
Chen Changhui, Deputy Ambassador of Viet Nam to Korea, said that VKBIA would create a good platform for exchanges and sharing of experiences and ideas between Vietnamese and Korean entrepreneurs, with the aim of expanding the space for investment cooperation, mutual assistance and mutual assistance to make a more effective contribution to Viet Nam's economic development and integration into international economic endeavours, and contributing to the dynamic development of trade relations in the country.
At the ceremony, VKBIA representatives signed cooperation agreements with representatives of the Viet Nam Association of Farming and Agribusinesses.
VKBIA coincided with the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the strategic partnership between the two countries, and was born in the context of the strengthening of practical cooperation between the two countries in the areas of foreign affairs, defence, security and the promotion of trade and investment cooperation aimed at achieving the goal of $100 billion in trade in both directions by 2020.
The Italian Minister of Education proposed a sugar tax to protect the health of the population.
The new Government of Italy, the Minister of Education of the Cabinet and member of the Five Star movement, Lorenzo Fiolamonti, submitted a motion to Parliament recommending a new tax policy for sugar-rich beverages, snacks and airline tickets to the Italian Government.
According to reports, pursuant to a motion for a bill by the Minister of Education, Fiolamonti, the Italian Government will impose a zero-food tax on dietary products that are harmful to health, such as sugary beverages, snacks, etc., while imposing environmental taxes on airline tickets, a levy of 1 euro on domestic flights and a levy of 1.5 euros on international classes.
Fiolamonti indicated that, through this seemingly small range of tax measures, the Government expected to receive 3 billion euros in tax revenues.
Funds from this tax will be used in the areas of education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister Conte stated that he believed that it was a viable option; Italian parliamentarians, European parliamentarians and coalition leader Salvini put it ironicly, asking everyone to hide dessert, biscuits, bread and candy, as the new Government was about to start a snack tax.
It was reported that the zero-food tax refers generally to a special tax on sugary beverages and high-heat foods.
The levy contributes to the benefits of public health.
On the evening of 25 September, local time, the Chinese Embassy in Canada hosted a reception in Ottawa to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
On the evening of 25 September, the new Chinese Ambassador to Canada (journalist Yu Shwe-Tun) hosted a reception in Ottawa to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In his message, Tsong Peng Wu stated that, in the 70 years since the establishment of the new China, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and thanks to the joint efforts of the Chinese people, China's special socialist cause has achieved remarkable achievements that have not only profoundly changed China's face for the benefit of its own people, but have also produced far-reaching world significance.
In keeping with its own national circumstances, China had opened a path of socialism characterized by China, had expanded the path towards modernization in developing countries and had contributed its wisdom and its programmes to solving human problems.
A photo exhibition on the theme of the 70th anniversary of the New China, co-located with guests, was presented.
As Tsong has stated, China has created rare miracles in the history of human development in the world and has made an important contribution to the promotion of world peace and development.
China adheres to an independent foreign policy of peace and has always advocated the basic norms of international relations, with the five principles of peaceful coexistence at its core, as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a guardian of the international order.
China's development offered new opportunities for development in all countries of the world, including Canada, and benefited all peoples.
It was emphasized that the history of nearly 50 years of development in China and China has shown that it is only by adhering to the principles of equality and mutual respect that relations between the two countries can move forward on the right track.
Conversely, relations between the two countries would be frustrated and the interests of the two countries undermined.
At the present time, China has experienced serious difficulties in its relations, and it is not the responsibility of China.
"Ringer must also be the bell man."
It is hoped that the parties will soon come up with an appropriate solution to the problems highlighted in their bilateral relations in order to create the conditions for the return to normal relations between the two countries.
The reception was attended by more than 700 representatives of Canadian government officials, federal senators, a wide range of friendly personalities, the Ambassador to Côte d'Ivoire and Chinese non-Chinese, Chinese institutions and students.
Diplomats from the Chinese Embassy in Ghana, such as Chen Myung Jian and the Congcai Xiao Xiao army, participated in the reception.
The reception featured a photo exhibition on the theme of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the New China, as well as promotional videos such as China 2019 and Beautiful China.
Both Chinese and Chinese artists and embassy diplomats performed special literary programmes.
This is also the first time that the 16th Ambassador of China to Canada, Tsun, has taken the lead in a public event.
The Institute arrived on 22 September and presented copies of the letters of State to the Chief Protocol Officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chief Protocol Officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wheeler, in Ottawa the following day.
He graduated from the Academy of Foreign Affairs when he was born in May 1967.
He had a permanent presence at the Chinese Embassy in Ghana at the beginning of the century.
Prior to his appointment to Canada, he served as Director of the North American Oceania Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China and as Minister Counsellor and Minister at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom.
In Hanoi, Viet Nam, efforts have been made to expand cooperation with Lao localities
Mr. Nguyen Dejong recalled the exchange of visits by the two sides and affirmed that those events had helped to foster the special and friendly relations between the two countries to which President Ho Chi Minh and President Kaishan Fon Weihan looked.
Mr. Nguyen Dejong expressed the hope that Ambassador Toongsawan would continue to serve as a bridge and link between Hanoi and the rest of the country, including Vientiane.
Ambassador Toongsawan said that his country had learned from and learned from many successful experiences in Viet Nam and was impressed by the breakthrough developments that had taken place in Hanoi city and Viet Nam in recent years.
Ambassador Tonsavan expressed his gratitude to the Municipality of Hanoi for the strong support and assistance it had been providing to the activities of the Lao Embassy in Viet Nam and trusted that, despite the volatility of the global situation, old relations would continue to develop well.
Mr. Nguyen de Chung is expected to lead a working mission to Vientiane, Lao capital, in early 2020.
From 2020, Hanoi City will offer a number of scholarships to Lao university students who study at various higher educational institutions in Hanoi.
The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the ASEAN mission hosted a reception on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the National Day.
On the evening of 26 June, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the Chinese Mission to ASEAN hosted a reception in Jakarta to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The reception was attended by more than 1,000 people from various Indonesian communities, representatives of various missions and international organizations in Indonesia, representatives of Chinese Chinese communities, Chinese institutions and students, and award-winning young artists on the theme “I and China”.
The Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, Shawkian, and the ASEAN Ambassador, Huang Qun, warmly welcome guests.
She spoke on behalf of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the ASEAN mission, saying that the birth of the new China in 1949 had ushered in a new era in China's history.
China has moved from closure and backwardness to openness, from lack of food and clothing to comprehensive prosperity, and from poverty and weakness to prosperity and prosperity. The Chinese nation has made a historic leap from standing up and being rich to being strong.
She said that, in recent years, China and Indonesia had made significant progress in their relations, with growing political mutual trust, sustained progress in practical cooperation and a comprehensive expansion of exchanges in all fields, and that the full-fledged strategic partnership between the two countries had gone a long way.
China-ASEAN relations have continued to rise in quality and have always adhered to mutual respect, understanding, trust and support in order to contribute significantly to the peaceful, stable and prosperous development of the region.
According to Shaw, the fundamental aspect of the development of the new China over the past 70 years is that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have created and developed the socialist path of Chinese identity.
This path, adapted to the times and in line with China's national circumstances, is a profound change in the destiny of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. It also makes a significant contribution to the peaceful development of the world and the region. It is the path of a strong country that can walk well, well and well.
The map draws guests to view the theme tour of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The video, which is divided into three parts: “China’s development achievements”, “China’s development achievements”, “China’s Indonesia’s stable relations” and “China’s ASEAN relations upgrading”, received a lively round of applause.
The reception also featured a special exhibition on the theme of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which attracted guests to visit.
The first hundred-degree autopilot taxi squads started a test operation.
Yesterday, 100 degrees announced in Changsha that the pilot operation of Robotaxi, an automated taxi team, was officially opened.
The first 45 “Red flag EV” Robotasi vehicles developed jointly by Apollo and a red flag began to operate on a trial basis in the open test section of the Changsha sector.
From this day onward, ordinary Changsha citizens can access the Apollo network to apply for seed users and have an opportunity to experiment with the experience.
One experienced passenger indicated that he was in the back of the vehicle and clicked on the passenger's front screen, opening the autopilot of the vehicle on the first button.
In the vehicle, for the safety of passengers and as required by current policy regulations, the pilot vehicle is equipped with a safety officer in the driver's seat to maximize the safety of passengers.
During the course of the journey, vehicles can make intelligent diversions depending on the condition of the road, and they can also determine the condition of the surrounding vehicle and make automatic concessions, such as in the case of close-distance crossings.
Throughout the experience, the passenger area screens show in real time the road conditions of pedestrians, cars and even some of the traditional blind areas on the road.
Even when vehicles are blocked, information such as changes in the front red and green lights and waiting times can be seen in advance, and all traffic conditions are clear.
Unmanned people have heard of it on television before, thinking it's far away from us, but it feels amazing to find it in our lives today.
We expect it to truly enter civilian life in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo obtained 45 human test plates issued by the Changsha municipality.
At present, Changsha's autopilot tests open roads, passing through the city's areas of Artificial Intelligent Technology City, Lake May Creek, Lake Ocean, Wangshan and High Shining Zone, all of which are 135 kilometres long, and the demonstration area, which covers 70 square kilometres, is the longest, largest and most complex of the country's roads.
By the end of 2019, the Apollo Robotaxi convoy is expected to cover approximately 50 kilometres of the pilot road in Changsha, with plans to cover 135 kilometres of the road currently open in Changsha in the first half of 2020.
There's still a problem with the women's platoon winning the game: it's hard to beat a strong team with so many mistakes.
In the afternoon of Beijing time 27, the Chinese women's club celebrated the ninth round of the 2019 women's World Cup against the strong Dutch women's team, which culminated in the victory of the Chinese women's platoon 3:1 over the Dutch women's team and the nine-time victory of the women's World Cup.
However, after the match, the female platoon leader, Mr. Ping, expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's performance in the third round.
“The third round is more aggressive than the other side, and some of us can't hit the ball without it, and we've made a lot of mistakes.”
"To fight with a strong team, you've made so many mistakes, it's hard."
In an interview after Lampingsai, he said:
“We say to the team to focus, and when the story is not in place, we're going to get the reset done, and we're going to fight each other.”
Luang Ping also commented on Zhang Changning's performance, stating that she had some difficulties in the attack, was anxious, too eager to kill the ball, and that her movements would be distorted.
Let's hope she's patient, "Let's protect her."
China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.
White Paper (New China 70 years): China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.
The White Paper states that China's development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.
According to the White Paper, with the rapid rise in China's combined national power and international influence, there are international fears that China will follow the path of “the powerful” and some raise the so-called “China threat doctrine”.
This has ranged from cognitive misunderstandings, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalances brought about by the strength to grow, to deliberate distortions in defence of their vested interests.
Achieving national prosperity, national revitalization and the well-being of the people is both a dream of the Chinese people and a common dream of all peoples.
“China’s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.”
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of economic growth in the world, that China is the largest contributor to economic growth in the world, that technological innovation in China has injected new energy into economic growth in the world, and that the role of the stabilizer and the engine of the future Chinese economy is even more evident.
At a time when the world economy is not sufficiently dynamic for growth, a sound Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to the world.
China's economy is moving from high-growth to high-quality development. New forms of industrialization, informationization, urbanization and modernization of agriculture have accelerated, the economy has been restructured in depth, the industry has been continuously upgrading, and new economic growth has emerged.
“A study by the McKinsey Global Institute suggests that by 2040, China’s integration with the rest of the world’s economies is expected to generate an economic value of $22 trillion to $37 trillion, equivalent to 15–26% of the global economy, and that greater cooperation between the rest of the world’s economies and China will create enormous economic value.”
The White Paper emphasized that the Chinese economy and the world economy had undergone structural changes and were deeply integrated.
China, with a more stable economy, a higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term benefit to the world economy.
Considering China's economic development as a “threat” and a “challenge”, trying to “decord” China from global industrial chains, supply chains, and value chains and to “decord” it from the world economy is not feasible and harmful.
According to the White Paper, full-fledged openness creates more opportunities for countries to share the “China dividend”.
China is steadfast in pursuing a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy to achieve greater and higher levels of openness to the outside world. China has the world's most potential consumer markets. China is the most attractive destination for investment.
“Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-sided.
A mutually beneficial two-way approach can last for the long term.”
The White Paper stated that China was committed to sustained expansion of imports, liberalization of market access, improvement of the business environment and enhancement of intellectual property protection, and that other countries should expand their openness and take corresponding initiatives in an effort to improve their business environment.
It is only by working together that an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment can be created, and the “cake” of development can be made bigger and a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests can emerge.
According to the White Paper, China provides the international community with more public goods.
These include the promotion of a high-quality "one-way", the establishment of multilateral platforms for dialogue and cooperation, active participation in international and regional affairs, and active foreign assistance.
“China has benefited from the international community's development, and has always given back to the family of nations in order to provide the international community with more and better public goods.”
The General Manager of the Russian Export Centre, Andrei Slepniov, in a recent written interview with a Xinhua journalist, expressed Russia's willingness to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade fields, further optimize its export structure and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.
Slepniov noted that while the forestry, mechanical and chemical industries account for a significant proportion of Russian exports to China, the export of agricultural products is also important, ranging from fat products, meat products and dairy products to cereals, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russian exports of non-material and non-energy products to China have also shown good and steady development.
Referring to the optimal Russian export structure to China, Slepniov said that the Russian side had set a mandate to expand exports of high-technology products to meet the demand for high-technology products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
The Russian Federation will then improve its financial and non-financial support measures and promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
The Russian Federation has expressed its readiness to export construction technology and high-tech construction materials to China and to develop cooperation with China in areas such as medicine and aviation manufacturing.
There is also great potential for cooperation between the Russian and Chinese sides in the area of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russian products in many areas had “quality advantages and price competitiveness” over similar Western products.
Referring to the two countries'goal of achieving $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2024, Slepniov said that areas such as agriculture, machinery manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry would play an important role in achieving that goal.
The Russian side intends to contribute to the diversification of supply in these areas and to the export of highly processed products.
He stressed that the Russian side intended to facilitate the entry of its exporters into the global value-added chain, in which China was one of the directions of development.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas and chemicals are well placed to participate in this process.
At present, there is a need for both countries to continue to deepen business cooperation, “to establish more joint Russian-Chinese ventures and to develop exports to third countries”.
Slepniov indicated that the Russian Export Centre, through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank, was undertaking a variety of measures and services to support exports of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Centre will continue to deepen its cooperation with the relevant Chinese sectors in order to promote easier access for Russian goods to the Chinese market and to develop new types of exports to China.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the so-called "diplomatic breakthrough":
In response to Taiwan's recent entry to United Nations Headquarters for meetings on religious issues, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China responded at a regular press conference that such minor moves were ignoble and laughterful.
A question was posed by journalists, who, according to the Taiwanese media, had recently entered United Nations Headquarters for a meeting on religious issues in the United States and called it a “diplomatic breakthrough”.
The meeting to which you referred was a United States side event on the premises of the United Nations, not a United Nations meeting at all.
To say the truth, the people of the Taiwan staged a sneaky, self-defeating, self-proclaimed so-called “diplomatic breakthrough”, which was a disgraceful little move and made a big smile.
He noted that the United Nations side had repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to the issue of Taiwan in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758 and that the general membership of the United Nations was committed to the one-China principle.

On that day, an innovative and fundamental outreach platform – the “good Chinese story” database – was officially launched, with the aim of “talking Chinese stories and disseminating Chinese voices” – to present the world with a true, stereo, comprehensive China.
Opening the “China Good Story” database, a distant ink-drawn ink-fish roll has spread, opening up the reader's memory of a new Chinese story that travels through time and time.
The database contains more than 60,000 wonderful stories, ranging from the traditional story of the “good-faithful nation” and the “fooled mountain”, to the story of the new era, “I will not forget the first heart”, in which thousands of good Chinese stories become living carriers of the “Chinese spirit” and “China’s wisdom” and “China’s power”.

The authorities have shown a strong crackdown on the president's downfall in Mount Egypt.
Twitter feature tags and social media are strongly advocating that Egyptians take to the streets today to peacefully demand the resignation of President Sessi.
However, the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Since the military coup of Cessi, then head of the military, which seized power in 2013, the expression of dissent has virtually disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest has become extremely dangerous.
The British newspaper Guardian reported that the Cairo-based non-governmental organization, the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, had stated that more than 1900 people had been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests last weekend demanding the resignation of Sessi.
Allegations of corruption around Cessi and his family's wasteful pursuit of vanity have led thousands of people to demonstrate on the streets since the beginning of the 20th day.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior firmly stated yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country would be met with determination and determination.
The city centre of Cairo is already heavily guarded, and riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes policemen were seen on the streets around Tahrir Square, where the Egyptian revolution detonated in 2011.
Al-Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of leading scholars and social sages on 25 days, including Nafa, a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist.
“I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Cessi will cause disaster”, he wrote in a tweet on 24th.
"It is in Egypt's interest for him to step down immediately."
Prior to Nafa's arrest, Hosni, former Chief of Staff of the Egyptian military, was detained as spokesperson for Annan.
Anna was arrested last year after an attempt to win the presidency with Sethi.
The President of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that, at a time when the economic plight of the poor and the middle class is exacerbated, the silencing of dissidents reflects the instability and fragility of the Government.
The leader of the opposition, Ayman Nour, who fought for the presidency, said: “The arrest highlights the regime’s disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fear.”
“Cessi tried to send a clear message to key leaders and politicians who might replace them, because the economy had been ruined by him, coupled with widespread political repression.”
Noor noted that, in the context of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the Government's high-handed approach would only increase the population's anger.
Since the barrier of fear had been broken, he expected more people to go to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain, was a former construction contractor for the Egyptian military and began to upload a series of films early in the month, claiming to have benefited from the corruption of the Government, which triggered a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali stated that his company, Amlake, was able to obtain lucrative contracts without having to go through the required bidding process, emphasizing the corruption of the military and its relatives, including the First Lady, Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply sorry that he had been involved in it.
Ali claims that his assistance to the Fulfilled Palace and the luxury hotel in Sessigue stands in stark contrast to the abject poverty currently being experienced by Egyptians, and that the other party has not yet paid for it.
On Twitter, such thematic labels as "Stand Up You Are Not Alone", "Sessi You Are Dead", "Sessy Rolling" and "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and pushbacks calling for people to go to the streets peacefully to demand Seth to step down.
There are almost 7 million followers on the Twitter of Amarwick, a Hollywood Egyptian male star.
He tweeted yesterday in Arabic: “Cessi is doomed...he is finished, and those who support him are now making a big mistake.”
Hong Kong has introduced a special free training program to help recently economically affected employees get through the crisis.
On 27th day, the HKSAR Government announced the introduction of a free special training scheme for employees affected by recent economic conditions, which allows eligible students to receive a maximum of HK$4,000 per month for training benefits upon completion of the course.
Many fine shops in Hong Kong’s Tsim Shattao seaport have very few customers.
As a result of recent social strife in Hong Kong, there has been a significant decline in the number of visitors to Hong Kong, with the exception of the tourism industry, which has affected the hotel, catering and retail sectors.
The Director-General of the Labour and Welfare Department of the HKSAR Government, Qiu Tenghua, Director of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development, commissioned the Employees Retraining Bureau to conduct a special training programme and to meet with the media on measures to support the tourism industry.
Lo Chi Quang described the challenges facing Hong Kong's economy as imminent and should not wait until the situation calmed down.
Therefore, the HKSAR Government has introduced this free training program, “Special? Love Added”.
It was stated that persons who had been unemployed or who had been asked by their employers to take unpaid leave since 1 June had the opportunity to participate in the scheme, provided that the relevant requirements had been met.
The curriculum is extensive, with the most important part being “vocational skills” training, covering 19 industries, including tourism, retail and catering, as well as brand new “innovation technology” courses and cross-industry “general skills” courses.
The Chairman of the Employees Retraining Bureau, Yu Peng Chun, stated that tuition fees were completely free for all courses and that the plan was expected to support some 10,000 people in need.
A special allowance of HK$4,000 per participant per month is payable to participants who complete each full-time or part-time course and attend an attendance rate of 80 per cent.
It was stated that the training course, which lasted two to three months, was provided by some 50 training institutions and was accessible to the public between 3 October and 31 March next year, with up to four courses per person.
In addition, the HKSAR Government has announced a series of measures in support of the tourism industry to assist the industry to overcome its difficulties.
These measures include the easing of allocations to the tourism parliament, the financing of 6,000 additional guided tours and the exemption of travel agents from annual fees.
What's wrong with you?
According to the Russian satellite network, a study of athletes showed signs of fatigue in the brain as a result of high-intensity motion.
This study, led by Mathias Pesigrion, an expert from the Pitié-Sarperture Hospital in France, shows that there is no obvious link between mental and physical labour: both require cognitive control of activities.
Pescion explains that: "You need to control the autonomous process of forcing yourself to stop when muscle and joint pains occur."
The study was launched by the French National Institute for Physical Education and Physical Education (INSEP).
The school specialist is responsible for guiding athletes in their preparations for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from excessive training syndrome, i.e. an insufferable sense of fatigue, physical inability to recover and a decline in performance following high-load sports.
INSEP asked the question: Is this disease partly due to nervous fatigue, which is caused by over-intelligent work?
The study was published in the magazine Contemporary Biology.

Each contestant, carrying a bottle of “Macao Beer” tray, crosses the streets of “Macao Historic City” to bring the beer safely to the front of the terminal as quickly as possible. The process is strained, attracting a large number of passengers to take photographs and even breathe for the contestants along the way, and displays Macao's tourist attraction.
The male champions were won by Warren Obejas Cabada, in the heart of the city of Macau; the female champions were Ye Xiaojin of the Vision Group; and the most special costume winners were Eung-ming and Choi Ji-hoon of the Golden Dragon Hotel of the Vision Group, respectively.

"Go Out" for Chinese citizens - visit Choi Ai-min, Director of Consular Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Wherever you go, the country is behind you.
On 25 November, the first Ministry of Foreign Affairs had launched a short film on the protection of public goods, which ended with a statement resonance from a wide network of friends.
In an interview with a Xinhua journalist, the Director-General of Consular Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Choi Ai-min, stated that the short film was intended to further make the public feel the love and temperature of “diplomatics for the people” and to make Chinese citizens feel that Chinese diplomats would extend their help, help, strength and hope to them, wherever they may be in any corner of the world.
There's nothing wrong with being out there. There's nothing to worry about.
According to Choi E-min, over the past 70 years, the number of “exits” by Chinese citizens has increased dramatically, from “less than a million a year” before reform and opening up to more than a billion times a year today; at the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens travelling abroad is more secure, and consular protection and assistance efforts have expanded from overseas Chinese to various groups such as Chinese diasporas, tourists, students and workers.
According to statistics, since the Party's eighteenth birthday, we have organized more than 10 major evacuations or relocations of Chinese citizens abroad, resulting in the safe evacuation of more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
Some 500,000 cases of various kinds of help have been received and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the country can take you home; it's no longer a dream to have a "go-go-go" trip.
According to Choi E-min, by the end of August this year, China had concluded visa-free mutual agreements with 14 countries covering persons with ordinary passports.
In addition, an increasing number of countries have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens entry facilities such as visa waivers or landing visas.
Forty-two countries and territories, including Thailand, Egypt and others, have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens with ordinary passports land visas, while another 15, such as Indonesia, have unilaterally allowed Chinese citizens with ordinary passports to be exempted from entry.
In addition to arrangements such as waivers, landings, etc., Chinese citizens are becoming easier and easier to apply for visas.
By the end of August, China had concluded visa facilitation agreements or arrangements with 41 countries.
These include reciprocal visas with the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina for tourism, 10 years of valid multiple visas for business personnel and two years of multiple visa arrangements with the United Kingdom for tourism, commerce and family visits.
The United Kingdom and Belgium jointly introduced a “visa one stop” service, while France, Italy and Singapore reduced visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who often leave the country, the APEC business travel card, which is easily accessible and accessible, is a good option.
According to Choi Aimin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining multiple visas for more than five years in 16 economies around Asia and the Pacific, and is significant for business people, especially private business personnel, to “go out”.
At present, China's effective holding of cards is among the top of the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote visa facilitation measures by more countries for Chinese citizens, translate the results of diplomatic efforts more into welfare initiatives for all citizens, and continuously increase the " gold content " of Chinese passports.

Journalists have been informed by the Road Transport Authority of Jiangxi Province that, to date, 1334 passenger transport lines have been “longlined” in 11 municipalities and 6 prefectures.
The head of the Road Transport Authority of Jiangxi Province explained that the security situation for road passengers was more serious owing to the formality of the security management of some of the passenger carriers, the failure of business security agents to take responsibility, the excessive speed of passenger vehicles and the tired driving of drivers, among other violations.

At present, 92 road passenger companies in Jiangxi have implemented a “long line” and selected 1334 line managers, covering 4824 mobile buses.
It was stated that the “head of the line” was typically staffed by personnel designated by road transport passenger carriers, who were specifically responsible for managing the relevant line lines, vehicles, lines, etc., ensuring that the head of the line had complete control over the lines, vehicles, drivers, operating environments, etc., and ensuring the safe operation of the line.

Fortune provincial tax bank, Silver Indigent Tax Paying Platform, officially online - China-New Network
The Hong Kong tax collection platform is officially launched in Fujian province.
On 27 September, in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, the Hong Kong tax collection platform was officially launched in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province.
The journalist was informed that on 26 October 2018, the central branch of Fukuzhou, People's Bank of China, jointly signed a tripartite memorandum of cooperation between the State Tax Administration of Fujian Province and the China Silver Union Ltd., which set up a national platform to collect taxes and taxes for the benefit of the provincial tax bank.
After almost a year of construction, the platform is now on-line successfully.
The Director-General of the Treasury of the central bank of Fukuzhou, Wang Deok-hye, introduced the platform, which was based on the concept of security, universality, convenience, compliance and leadership. The front end was linked to tax, government, banking, non-bank paying agencies and social service providers. The platform provided a wide range of tax collection channels online, such as mobile phone APP, micro-credit public, tax halls, bank points, inclusive financial services points, and the back end was connected to the treasury and tax system.
According to the information received, the platform brings together a number of projects for the benefit of the population, of which the project for the collection of fees for health care for urban and rural residents has been officially launched.
The project provides services to more than 30 million urban and rural residents in Fujian province and covers 76 per cent of the permanent resident population in Fujian province.
Health insurance payments can be made online through the “Closing Tax Lines” and the “Cunt Flash” of banks, such as the APP, the Micro-Credit Public, and under-line payments can be made in a variety of ways, such as scavenging, voltage, and swipe cards, to tax halls and rural inclusive financial services sites in Fujian province.
The Vice-President of the Fuzhou Central Branch of the People's Bank of China, Shidong, stated that the platform's success had been brought to the fore and that, while ensuring that government revenues were deposited directly into the bank and that data and information were exchanged in real time, it was possible to provide a safe, efficient, multi-channel and multi-modal household tax service to the public at large.
At present, more than 16,000 inclusive financial services sites across the province have opened up a health-care fee collection function of over 9,000, making it easier for rural residents to pay their health-care contributions without being able to reach their villages and giving the public an increasingly strong sense of “access”, “happiness” and “happiness”.
According to statistics, in the 20 days since the pre-test operation of the Platform's health-care fee collection project for urban and rural residents, the number of service users has reached 840,000, of which 750,000 are on-line and nearly 20,000 are covered by inclusive financial services points.
In addition, the Deputy Director-General of the Fujian Department of Revenue of the State Tax Administration revealed at the event that the platform had pioneered the application of the block chain electronic payment certificate technology throughout the country.
Starting next month, the payer may also download the stamped electronic certificate of contribution directly through his mobile phone after completion of the contribution.
The Fujian tax information network, based on block chain technology, is being built, and the “high-speed road” for private tax payments will be further expanded.
The United States will deploy additional air defence systems and troops in Saudi Arabia.
The United States Department of Defense announced on 26 November that, as a result of the previous attack on Saudi oil facilities, the United States would deploy an additional “patriotic” air defence system, four “Sentry” radar systems and some 200 United States troops in Saudi Arabia.
In a statement on the same day, the Pentagon stated that the deployment would upgrade the anti-aircraft and anti-missile capabilities of key military targets and civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and enhance the United States military presence in the area.
The statement also stated that United States Secretary of Defense Esper had simultaneously approved the inclusion of two “patriotic” air defence systems and a “Sad” ABM system in the preparation deployment sequence.
Some United States defence media questioned the effectiveness of the deployment, arguing that the main targets of the “patriotic” and “Sad” systems for interception were not low-altitude targets such as drones and cruise missiles that the United States claimed attacked Saudi Arabia.
In his address to the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Rouhani said that Iran could help to maintain “safe Persian Gulf” and ensure the smooth and safe passage of oil transport vessels through the Strait of Hormuz, with equitable rights for all States.
At the same time, he stressed that regional security could be achieved only if United States forces withdrew from the area.
On 14 this month, several drones attacked two Saudi National Oil Company oil installations and set fire to them.
The United States accuses Iran of having perpetrated the attack and of imposing new sanctions on Iran.
The Chairman of the Celes Growth Project completed last year’s call for staff to increase by up to 43%.
On the evening of 25 September, Cyrus (603716.SH) announced that the company's de facto controller and chairman, Wen Wei, had combined 10,542,000 shares in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, representing 0.5139 per cent of the company's total stock stock, with an additional sum of RMB 2009.26 million (including stamp duties, commissions, interest, etc.) to complete the plan.
Prior to the implementation of the scheme, Wenwei had a direct holdings of 8.18 per cent of the company's total stock of 8.5 million shares, accounting for 4.18 per cent of the company's total stock, and Tianjin City Sumi Scientific Instruments Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Tianjin Sumi”) held 82,183,500 shares of the company, accounting for 40.06 per cent of the company's total stock, and Wenwei held 66.06 per cent of the company's real control.
It is a matter of concern that this is not the first time that Célis has made a good offer.
Since last September, in a short period of one year, Cyrus has successively introduced measures such as executive growth, head-to-head initiatives, buy-back shares and equity incentives.
On 18 September last year, Celes announced that the seven planned top executives of the company, Liu Wenhouse, had accumulated 394,300 shares (0.1922 per cent of the company's total stock stock stock), with a total of $7,02.29 million, and that the implementation of the plan had been completed.
Shortly thereafter, the Chairman and the realist, Wenwei, initiated an initiative to increase corporate equity for their employees and promised that they would be compensated for their losses.
The increase covers the period from 19 October to 31 October 2018, with a total ceiling of 150 million yuan for the addition of the company's stock, which is subject to continuous holding of the company's stock for a period of more than 12 months and is not subject to reduction, and the employee is on board at the time the increase is compensated.
The journalist combing found that the minimum share price for the above-mentioned initiative staff was $14.02, up to $16.44, and the maximum floating surplus for the staff was 42.80 per cent, up to 21.78 per cent, at a cut of $20.02 on 25 September.
On 21 January of this year, Cyrus again adopted the Repurchase Company Equity Programme, in which it was announced that the total amount of funds to be used for the repurchase of shares was not less than 160 million yuan yuan and not more than 280 million yuan yuan.
On 8 August of this year, the company issued a draft of the Cyprus Restricted Stock Incentives Plan 2019 and set high performance conditions.
According to the bulletin, equity incentives were based on operating income in 2018, with growth rates of not less than 30 per cent, 70 per cent, 120 per cent and 185 per cent for the four fiscal years 2019-2022, respectively.
In terms of Celius'performance in the first half of the year, the company maintained high growth and exceeded the 30 per cent performance growth unlocked this year.
In the first half of the year, operating income was 842 million yuan, an increase of 46.50 per cent in the same year; the net profit attributable to shareholders in listed companies was 56,23.24 million yuan, an increase of 16.46 per cent in the same year.
And since mid-2018, Cyrus has grown by more than 38% on a year-on-year basis over five consecutive reporting periods, reaching a maximum of 59%.
In 2018, the company established a two-nuclear-driven and coordinated development strategy based on an intensive operation service for medical testing (IVD operations) and a breakthrough between the intensive operation service for medical consumption (SPD operations) and the regional testing centres to upgrade and advance SPD operations based on the consolidation of the advantages of the former IVD operations.
Céles-related sources told journalists that the three main operations of Célis were moving steadily towards rapid expansion in response to the general trend towards medical reform.
In the area of SPD operations, in January this year, Cyrus announced the signing of a cooperation agreement with the People's Hospital of the City of Lingwu and the Central Hospital of the City of Lingwu on the construction and day-to-day operation of an intensive operating platform for medical consumption, for a period of three years.
“In fact, Cyrus is expanding its SPD operations to provide health-care institutions with sophisticated operating services such as centralized procurement, warehousing management, distribution and settlement for long-term income.”
According to the above-mentioned persons.
On 17 September, on the basis of the Zhejiang Government Procurement Network's Government Procurement Services Information Platform (GAP) bulletin, Célis was awarded the “Provision of Logistics Extension Services in the Institute of Medical Waste (Incl. Reagents)” of the Zhejiang University Medical School, a subsidiary of Zhejiang University.
According to medical industry analysts, this winning target is very gold-bearing, and the JCI is the first public hospital in mainland China, and the successful implementation of the project in the future is an important development opportunity for the hospital.
According to its analysis, the operational map largely completed the operational area coverage of the country's provincial areas through regional outreach, national strategic cooperation and through M&As.
Today, in Zhejiang's next city, the successful hospital should continue to replicate the model in different hospitals and enhance the company's competitiveness in the East China market.
In addition, this year Célis has also laid out new and emerging areas such as industrial cannabis, block chain technology and others.
In Beijing, 78,000 volunteers travelled for the National Day.
In order to guarantee the smooth running of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, more than 78,000 volunteers from the country's transportation civilization will be officially placed on duty on the 28th and will volunteer at various points in the city until 8 October.
Prior to that, the Beijing City leadership group for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China had set up a special volunteer command, which in the preceding period had been aimed at universities, communities, businesses and all sectors of society. More than 160,000 highly qualified volunteers had been recruited and trained in the areas of volunteerism, such as the celebration of conferences, festivities, exhibitions of great achievements, national festivals and urban operations and security.
Of these, more than 78,000 volunteers from transportation civilizations.
High-level guests: Between 28 September and 8 October, 78,266 traffic civilized volunteers from the capital city conducted traffic facilitation and traffic guidance at 1700 traffic points and 308 subway stations in Beijing, including more than 300 major traffic hubs.
Two months after being held by Iran, the British tanker “Stanner Empire” was finally released and departed from the Iranian port of Abbas in the morning for international waters.
In the middle of last month, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory released an Iranian tanker that had been detained for more than a month.
According to the news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, at 9 a.m. local time 27 a.m., the British tanker “Stanner Empire” departed from the port of Abbas for international waters in the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian Port and Shipping Organization of Hormuzgan Province confirmed that the commander and crew of the vessel had made a formal and written commitment and that, despite their arrest, they had no claim.
The Swedish owner of the “Stanner Empire” tanker, Stena Bulk, also indicated that it was sailing from the port of Abbas.
In addition, vessel tracking data from Refinitiv found that the tanker had begun to move and left Abbas port in 27 days.
The British-flagged tanker, Stena Impero, was seized by Iran in July this year.
The company's spokesperson said that the tanker was preparing to leave the port of Abbas.
Two weeks after the British seized an Iranian tanker in the waters of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker, Steena Impero, on the Strait of Hormuz.
The vessel was released in August.
Earlier this week, the spokesman for the Iranian Government stated that all the legal procedures required for the release of the “Stanner Empire” had been completed.
However, the Iranian side indicated that the investigation was still ongoing.
Several Iranian media outlets also posted videos of the tanker's departure.
On 19 July, the IRGC Navy detained a British tanker, the Stanna Empire, in Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz, and then transported it to the port of Abbas.
The Iranian tanker, Grace I, was seized from the sea off Gibraltar.
In addition, on 4 July, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory seized the “Grace I” tanker carrying Iranian crude oil in the Strait of Gibraltar on the suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.
More than a month later, on 15 August, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of “Grace I”.
This afternoon, a conference was held in Changsha on the theme of education review and rehabilitation at undergraduate universities throughout the province.
The Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Council, Ulan, stressed the need to improve political positions, strengthen political commitment, take a critical look at the problems, and promote quality development in the construction, political thinking and reform of institutions of higher learning with a view to the effectiveness of thematic education.
Ulan is fully cognizant of the initial results of the second series of thematic education by undergraduate and higher education institutions.
She noted that education on the theme “Don't forget your mind, don't remember your mission” was a major deployment of the Party's centrality, and that undergraduate schools were required to follow up on the important messages of the General Secretary of Xi Jinping on the theme “Don't forget your mind, remember your mission”.
From the promotion of the "four consciousnesss" to the "two preservations", to the political height of the original mission, to the careful implementation of the provisions of the thematic education, particularly the set of issues to be examined, to the integration of all aspects of school reform and development, to the “double promotion”.
Ulland stressed the need to keep the knife in the ground, to keep the problem under review, to look into the “four contrasts” and “four search-and-see” tables, to open the door to suggestions from teachers and students, parents and all sectors of society, to examine the root causes in a serious and intellectual way, and to define the direction and improvement of efforts, and to come up with a hard way to solve the problems.
The word “change” should be applied in practice by maintaining precision, strengthening real change.
It is important to combine thematic education with the work of the “Leeds Trees” in order to make a difference in responsibility and ensure that the problem remains unsettled, and that it becomes more effective.
It is important to adhere to both the symptoms and the root causes, improve the long-term mechanisms, weave the cages of the penitentiary system, strengthen the rigidity of the system, ensure that the work is regulated, regulated and truly managed by the institution.
In keeping with the above, the leading cadres take the lead in strengthening the theoretical force, taking a serious look at the changes, taking the lead at times and playing the role of “critical minority” as a model, in an effort to accomplish the tasks of thematic education and reform.
Comrades from five institutions of higher learning, including Hunan University, were given a speech.
Two major high-pressure projects are being delivered on a "one-on-one" basis.
On 26 June, the direct transmission of electricity from the east to the south of the country at 1100 kV and the Sotoon 1,000 kV exchange at the GIL complex were delivered.
Both of these projects, which account for the current highs in each of the world's transmission technologies, will lead to a significant increase in the optimal configuration of the country's energy resources on a large scale.
The General Economist of the National Energy Agency, Guo Ji, stated that proximate east to Xiangnan was the transmission project with the largest power delivery capacity and the most distant transmission in the world.
Their delivery is important for promoting the development of the Xinjiang energy base and securing electricity supply in the East China region.
GIL, a closed transmission line for gas-insulated metals.
The Sutong Concourse project, which created a record of the highest global voltage and transmission capacity of the GIL project, achieved the combined operation of the `interchange two-ring net' of the highest voltage level of the Chinese backbone grid.
According to the National Electricity Network Corporation, the distance of power transmission from the North-East to the south-east was 3324 kilometres.
When conventional technologies are used, more than 15 per cent of electricity will be lost in transit, and the project has been developed and developed through closures, raising the economic transport distance significantly to more than 3,000 kilometres.
After delivery, 100 million degrees of electrical power can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes after delivery to Xinnan, which can help to disrupt the depletion of the new energy sources available in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, the annual electricity delivery of this line alone will reach between 60 and 85 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh), which will meet more than half of Shanghai's electricity use throughout the year.
The Sutong GIL Integrated Chrysotile Project is the control work of the ultra-high pressure communication ring network across the Yangtze.
The use of conventional empty lines across the river would require the installation of two giant towers of over 450 metres above the Yangtze River and the construction of an artificial island of over four football fields for each tower.
In response, the national electricity grid was boldly innovative, producing compact super-voltage exchange technologies for GIL transmission, crossing the river from the water through tunnels and avoiding the impact on the gold channel.
Two projects have contributed to a new leap in the capacity of our electricians to manufacture their equipment.
At present, the national grid has built cumulatively a “10-to-11” super-high voltage project, with a “4-to-3” in progress.
Foreign Exchange Office: our external debt structure continues to be optimized and external debt stability enhanced
“In general, the external debt structure of the country continues to be optimized, and external debt stability has increased.”
The press spokesman for the National Foreign Exchange Administration, Wang Chun Ying, the chief economist, stated on 27 September that the main indicators of our external debt were within the internationally recognized security line and that external debt risk was generally manageable.
Wang Chun-Ying made this statement in response to a question from journalists when the Foreign Exchange Bureau published external debt data for the end of June 2019.
The data show that, as of the end of June 2019, our external debt balance at full calibre (including this foreign currency) stood at US$ 1998 billion, an increase of US$ 26.3 billion, or 1.3 per cent, over the end of March 2019, largely due to the growth in the debt stock balance.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 per cent of our full-calibre external debt growth was driven by the purchase by non-residents of in-country renminbi bonds, mainly by medium- and long-term investors such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, the share of medium- and long-term external debt rose by 3 percentage points compared to the end of March 2019, and the share of foreign debt in this currency rose by 1 percentage point compared to the end of March 2019.
Wang Chun Ying stated that, with the incorporation of renminbi bonds into the Bloombergaclé Global Aggregate Index in April 2019 in our country, the recognition of Chinese bond markets by international investors has increased further, with a sustained increase in domestic renminbi bonds.
“Our balance of payments is generally balanced and external debt risks are manageable.”
The journalist learned from the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences on 27 September that the Yunnan meadows are now effectively protected against widespread outbreaks of violence and have achieved phased results.
In January of this year, the city of Jiangcheng County, Yunnan Pumang City, discovered for the first time that night moths had been moved from abroad, and subsequently confirmed their occurrence in 129 counties in Yunnan, as well as the gradual spread of night moths from Yunnan to the interior of China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
Grassland night moths, an important agricultural pest derived from the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas with a multi-edible long-range migration, are a major migratory pest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) global warning, characterized by “internationality, migration, outbreak, destruction”.
The pest endangers more than 80 crops, including maize, sugar cane and sorghum, and can cause up to 70 per cent of production losses.
Control is difficult and there are no registered pesticides in China to control the disease.
The Yunnan Department of Agricultural Sciences has selected Eidung Fellows to lead the Yunnan Department of Agricultural Sciences on cross-border harmful organisms in agriculture in coordination with the Green Prevention and Control Department innovation team on the first line, field research, sample collection and technical guidance and demonstration.
The team has acquired initial knowledge of the stock characteristics of night moths in the Yunnan meadows, the resources of natural trichlorfon, the characteristics of the source of off-shore insects, the trajectories of the population, the toxic effects of the agents and the effects of field control.
They have been active in research and application of green control technologies and have achieved more than 90 per cent control in demonstration areas through the implementation of new green control technologies such as stock monitoring, insecticide, scientific medicines and agronomy measures, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural enemy resources and the ecological environment and providing technical safeguards for the effective control of the outbreak of night moths and sustainable governance in Yunnan.
At present, night moths from the Yunnan meadows have been effectively protected from large-scale outbreaks and phased results have been achieved.
As a next step, the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on ecological mechanisms for the invasion of populations, breaking through the biocontrol and green control technology systems.
At the same time, cross-border international cooperation has been actively promoted with a view to establishing joint priority laboratories and joint monitoring networks and demonstration areas outside the country to enhance the full range of monitoring and early warning capabilities for night moths in Yunnan.
According to the website of the People's Bank of China, on 30 September 2019, the People's Bank of China is scheduled to issue the Chinese International Import Expo panda plus the silver and gold medals.
This set of silver and gold coins consists of two pieces, of which one is gold and one is silver and is the legal currency of the People's Republic of China.
It was reported that the positive picture of the silver and gold medals was a pavilion of the Beijing altar and that the names of the countries, the year number and the words “China International Import Fair” were published in Chinese.
The image of the back of the 8-gram circle gold medallion is a picture of the mother and the panda and is published in the words “8g Au.999” and “China International Import Fair” in English and in the square.
A picture of the back of the 30-gram circle silver memorized currency is given by the mother and panda and is published in the words “30g Ag.999” and “International Import Fair of China” in English and in the square.
The 8-gram circle gold memorized coin is described as a universal currency containing 8-gram pure gold, 22-mm diameter, 100-dollar face, 99.9-per-cent colour, with a maximum circulation of 10,000.
The 30-gram circle silver memorized currency is a universal currency containing 30-gram silver, 40-mm diameter, 10-dollar, 99.9-per-cent colour, with a maximum circulation of 20,000.
The silver and gold coins were forged by Shenyang Co. Ltd. and sold by China Gold General.
White paper: China moving out of a country-specific development path
On September 27, China News Agency Beijing launched the White Paper " China and the World in a New Era " by the Press Office of the State Council of China.
According to the White Paper, over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have struggled to explore and move forward, successfully opening the path of socialism of the Chinese identity and achieving world-renowned development achievements.
According to the White Paper, China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development is based on the spirit of “800 million shirts for a Boeing” — the constant struggle of generations and the unimaginable hard work and sweat of others — and on the sense of “one's own responsibility” — not to export problems, not to turn to contradictions, not to sell and plunder others by force; and on the spirit of “touching through the river” — not to follow the old path of imperialism, colonialism and the development model of the West, but to combine China's reality, to learn lessons, to learn from human civilization, to try and walk out a path of its own.
The White Paper stated that China had developed in its interaction with the world, that China's development had injected positive energy into world peace and development, and that China's roads were in line with China's national circumstances and the requirements of the times.
China is taking practical action to preserve world peace.
For 70 years, China had not initiated any war or conflict and had not appropriated an inch of another country's land.
The White Paper states that China's development has been a great success over the past 70 years, and that the fundamental reason is to find the right path to development, the socialism of China's identity, and to follow that path with determination.
It is a path that is based on national circumstances, that puts the interests of the people first, that is, reform and innovation, that seeks common development in openness and that is fully governed by the rule of law.
China, with its enormous size and complex national circumstances, its difficult governance is rare. Without a united and strong leadership, China will move towards division and disintegration, bringing disaster to the world.
The White Paper stated that over the past 70 years, China had overcome risks and challenges and created another world-renowned Chinese miracle.
In particular, since the 18th year of the Communist Party of China, China has achieved historic achievements and made historic changes, and the Chinese nation has taken a great leap from standing up to being rich to being strong, closer than ever before to the great goal of national renaissance.
This path of development in China will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
The World Marketing Declaration was launched jointly by representatives of 45 countries and regions.
At the Second World Congress on Marketing, 2019, held in the Kobridge district of Shaochen, Zhejiang province, representatives of the textile industry from 45 countries and regions co-sponsored the World Declaration on Marketing.
The Declaration states that, in the future, the countries concerned will work together to promote high-quality development in the textile industry in the world by maintaining open synergies, science and technology-driven and fashion-fashion transitions.
The World Conference brought together about 1,200 representatives of the textile industry from 45 countries and regions to explore the path towards sustainable development and cooperation in the textile industry around the trends in the world economic landscape.
The President of the Chinese Textile Industry Federation, Sun Riedger, stated that the current pattern of division of labour, trade and innovation in the global industry was undergoing profound adjustments, that the textile industry had entered a new phase of globalization, innovation and responsible development, and that the concept of “technology, fashion and green” was deepening.
“In order for industry to achieve sustainable development and shared prosperity, it needs the active participation of global textile workers, individual executives, and benefit-sharing.”
At the conference, representatives of the textile industry from 45 countries and regions co-sponsored the World Declaration on Marketing, which jointly articulated global textile industry development goals and visions.
The World Declaration on Marketing states that, in the future, the countries concerned will maintain their openness and synergy and will continue to promote industrial-market connectivity and increase the level of development of the industrial chain; will continue to be driven by science and technology, will continue to strengthen basic research, applied research and technological transformation, and will jointly upgrade the industrial infrastructure; and will leapfrog the concentration of fashion, fully harnessing the role of textile clothing as a vehicle for culture and a bridge for civilization, and will jointly promote industrial cultural values.
In an interview with Loureno Bartholomei, President of the Brazilian Association of Fashion Designers, it was stated that the publication of the World Distribution Declaration had helped countries to jointly upgrade the textile industry chain and achieve sustainable development of the textile industry.
Loureno Bartholomei, an example of Brazil’s Association of Fashion Designers, with more than 130 high-end local dressmaking brands, whose designers are committed to designing fashion, high-end dressmaking products, and Kobashi’s variety of fine fabrics, states that “through this conference, we also look forward to establishing links with the excellent suppliers of Kobashi and seeking more opportunities for cooperation.”
As the venue for the World Marketing Congress, Kebashi, with its world's largest textile market, is gradually building a new pattern of upgrading and opening up to the interior, with its unique entire textile chain, representing China's textile image at the forefront of the world.
The Secretary of the Kohashi District Council, Shen Zhijiang, said that Kohashi would be an opportunity to move the textile industry towards a more open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win world, as a pioneer.
Reciprocal counter-cyclical impact of 460 points is around $7.0883.
Reuters calculates on the basis of the RMB formation mechanism announced by the China Foreign Exchange Trading Centre (CFETS), which is expected to be around $7.0883 on Friday against the dollar, a decline of about 154 points from the previous day.
The last Japanese renminbi was received on the spot against the United States dollar in the amount of $7.1315, while the median price was $7.0729.
According to the pricing mechanism, of today's intermediate price movements, 586 drops reflect the impact of market supply and demand, while another 27 fall reflects the number of points required for a basket of exchange rates to remain essentially constant overnight; and 460 increase reflects the “reverse cyclical factor” effect.
The median price of the last Japanese renminbi against the United States dollar was 7.0947 and the actual difference of 218 points published by the Exchange Exchange Centre.
On the basis of the intermediate price estimates published by CFETS, the renminbi exchange rate CFETS index, the reference SDR (SDR) basket index and the reference BIS (BIS) basket index were 91.26, 91.46 and 94.92, respectively.
The first high building in the north of China, Tianjin Chow, was completed with more than 100 national patents.
The completion ceremony of the Tianjin Chou Dafu Finance Centre in China’s 1st High Building in Tianjin in the afternoon was held in the New Zone in Tianjin, marking the success of the co-management platform in the field of building skyscrapers, a global award-winning architectural information model for global excellence in engineering and construction, developed autonomously by the Tianjin Chou Fong Finance Centre’s project department.
The Tianjin Dafu financial centre, located in the economic and technological development area of Tianjin City, has a total construction area of 390,000 square metres, 4th basement level, 100th basement level, 530 metres high, covering class A offices, luxury apartments, superstar hotels, etc., and will form an important part of the internationalized landmark complex of Tianjin.
The head of the project department of the Tianjin Zhou Finance Centre in China reported that the entire project had a steel capacity of over 70,000 tons, with a high-altitude group of approximately 376,000 metres of welding equivalent to 42.5 knots of Everest, welding of 40 laps around the Earth, steel construction of 42,000 pieces and more than 50 per cent of non-fixed components, including the double tube ellipse diagonal poles of 90 degrees in the world's single most distorted angle.
The complexity and difficulty of processing the steel structure of the Tianjin Dafu project is unprecedented.
According to industry sources, the Tianjin Dafu Financial Centre has taken the lead in the implementation of the building information model (BIM) throughout the country in the construction of skyscraper buildings already built or under construction.
Creatively proposed and successfully implemented a fully participatory, professional and process-wide “triple-wide BIM application” model, and a collaborative management platform based on a high-precision BIM model was developed.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that during the construction of Dafu Zhou, the project department began with the BIM construction in the virtual world, followed by scientific verification and subsequent physical construction, thereby eliminating in the bud the problems that might arise from dismantling and returning to work in the construction work that had taken place in the past.
In 2017, the BIM innovation of the Zhou Dafu Finance Center project won the first prize from the Global Engineering Industry Award for Global Excellence at the Global AU Masters and the 2017 Awards for Global Excellence in Engineering.
During the construction of the project, the Ministry produced more than 130 national patents.
It is worth mentioning that the success of the BIM innovation project in Tianjin and the promotion of scientific and technological innovation have not only resulted in a single success in the complex and complex construction process, which has been reduced by more than four months, but has also led to significant improvements in security management, among other things.
Not long ago, the Tianjin Chow Dafu Finance Centre project also won the 2019 ISA International Security Award.

Taiwan scholars have argued that the “indeterminate times” players need to keep up with the mainstream industries on the continent.
The “2019 Business Innovative Business Models Forum” was held in Taipei on 26, 27 days a day or two.
The event invited a number of representatives of broadcasters and scholars to share their experiences on business transformation, innovation, succession and market development.
The Forum was hosted by the Taipei Institute of Business Management and co-sponsored by such organizations as Goldstone Securities and the Alliance of Outstanding Continental Trade Unions.
The two days were divided into workshops on transition and upgrading models, business strategies, etc., which were attended by more than 100 participants.
Chen Ming-hoon, President of the Taipei Institute of Business Management, stated that trade frictions between China and the United States persisted and that customers faced “undefined times”.
In his view, it was necessary to keep pace with the times and keep pace with the mainstream industries developing on the continent, with particular attention to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"Once upon a time, the operator valued quality, effectiveness and delivery. "
According to Chen Mingjian, these conditions alone are no longer sufficient at this time.
He referred to the need for firms to combine speed and services, speed up supply chains, and focus on extension and product services.
In addition, “service value added” is a new area where businesses can significantly develop.
A statement was made by the representative of Taiwan, who, in his capacity as Chairman of the Taiwan Trader Ame Electronics Company Ltd., Guangdong, introduced Xu Wen Chamber, who had described the business difficulties caused by the sharp decline in orders, and the group had begun to improve its operations through various orientations, such as structural adjustments and living assets.
The removal of traditional electrical services, the use of electronic equipment for the transformation of vehicles, and the advance of the intelligent household electricity industry took three years for businesses to collect.
The General Manager of Solar God (Beyond) Electronics Co. Ltd., Shih Hung, suggested that if it was difficult to develop new customers, it would be preferable to focus on the original customers to provide a “one-stop” service.
The replacement of a customer is not unique to the factors of poor service delivery, high price, low quality, slow delivery, low variety and integrity, which, together with the timely adaptation of production lines and the expansion of product lines, make the enterprise itself an irreplaceable supplier for the client.
The ceremony of the 2019 Outstanding Continental Dealers Award, also hosted by the Taipei Business Management Institute, was held in Taipei on 27 November.
According to the Taiwan Daily Journal of the Economy, the General Manager of Golden Land Corporation, which operates in Shanghai, was awarded the “Order of Excellence and Cross-Strait Contribution Award”.
New regulations for consultation: qualification for access to rural land by social capital
Qualified access to rural land by social capital
Public consultation on the rural land transfer management scheme to regulate the transfer of social capital to land rights, such as business enterprises
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development published an open notice for comments on the Management of Rural Land Administration Transfers (Revised Draft Comments) (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Views), which increased the regulation and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital to land, such as business enterprises.
The Draft Opinion is now open to public consultation.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in order to implement the newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act, to further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, to deepen the reform of the rural land system and to implement the “triple power-sharing” system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has revised the Rural Land Contracting Transfer Management System, which has resulted in a Draft Opinion.
The Beijing Young News journalist was informed of several important changes to the first publication of the Draft Opinion.
The newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act defines the scope of land transfer and implements the concept of “triple separation of powers”, with separate sections on “the right to contract land” and “the right to operate land”, making a clear distinction between the transfer, swap and transfer of rights to contract land (rents, subcontracts, shares or other).
In this Draft Opinion, in order to implement the concept of “triple separation of powers”, respond effectively to the thrust of the amendments to the Law on Rural Land Contracting, and take into account the significant differences between the transfer of land and the transfer of land contracting rights, in terms of parties, procedures, regulation, etc., this revision defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of land, including by renting, entering shares, etc., and changes the regulatory title from the Scheme for the Transfer of Rights in Rural Land Contracting to the System for the Transfer of Rights in Rural Land.
Transfers and swaps of land contracting rights will be regulated separately.
According to the Draft Opinion, in the context of the “three-power division”, farmers are only entitled to land ownership for a limited period of time.
Theoretically, even in the event of liquidation, farmers only run the risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time, thus providing for the return of the contracting land to the original contractor is no longer legally necessary and in conflict with the Bankruptcy Act.
In order to protect farmers against the risk of land loss, priority shares, first-to-rent, buy-back, etc., have been developed in practice.
Taking into account that priority shares already have more mature theoretical explorations of company law, it is suggested that they be used as advocacy provisions to protect against the risk of loss of access.
