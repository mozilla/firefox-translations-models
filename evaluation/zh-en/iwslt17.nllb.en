Well, let me tell you a story, it's about how we know what we know.
This story is about this woman, Natalyazh Ryzhensky.
She is an archaeologist, specializing in digging up ancient objects everywhere.
Natalya Lizhensky: Yes, some people call me Dr. Death Thing".
I think she's particularly interesting, because the place she digs is in the Arctic Circle, a remote Canadian territory.
One summer day in 2006, she was at an archaeological dig called Prachyrzhyeblat, which is less than 10 degrees from the Earth's magnetic North Pole.
NR: To tell you the truth, it sounds like nothing. You have to pack your bag all day, carrying a GPS navigator and a laptop, traveling a long way, and finding something that may be fossil, you have to come up with something.
However, at some point, she noticed something.
A little piece of iron, probably as big as my palm heart.
It's lying on the ground.
Her first reaction was that it was just a piece of wood, because it was something that people had found on the foliage of the phars, a prehistoric plant body.
But that night, returning to the camp...
NR: I pulled out my handheld microscope, and I looked closer, and suddenly I noticed that this thing looked like it didn't have a yearling.
"It may be a conservation issue, but it looks like it really is"....
"there is a bone".
For the next four years, she repeatedly visited the site, eventually collecting 30 fragments, all from the same bone, many of which were very tiny.
"It's not much, really. A small chain bag can be put down".
Then she tried to put the pieces together like a puzzle.
But this is very challenging.
"It broke into many tiny pieces, and we tried to recover it with sand and oil ash, but it looked bad".
"Finally, we used a 3D surface scanner".
"Hello, is that right?"
Finally, I found that virtually restoring the system was much simpler.
"When they're all put together, it feels really magical".
How well do you know how to spell it, exactly as it was written?
Is it possible that you could spell it another way, and finally spell it out... a little bit?
"Oh, no, no. We're definitely wrong about that".
She discovered that she had been carved out of a bone, a femur, and that this bone was derived from a rare mammal, such as a cow, sheep, and so forth.
But it is absolutely impossible that this was a cow or a sheep.
It's actually too big.
 This thing is really too big.zh This is a huge animal.zh
So what kind of animal would it be?
Now that she has met bottlezh, she showed a piece of it to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and then they had an idea.
We used a little bit of a stick, then we put a little bit of a stick around the edge of the debris, then we got some very magical scent from there.
It smells a bit like burnt skin.
This is a smell Natalie knew, she smelled when she cut the skull in a large anatomy lab, and that is the protein zh.
The protein makes our bones hard.
Generally, after such a long time, it will naturally decompose.
However, in this case, the Arctic is preserved as if it were a natural refrigerator.
A year or two later, Natalie went to Bristol to attend a conference, where she saw a colleague of hers, named Mac Barclay, present a new technology, which he called the "prototein fingerprinting technique".
In fact, different species of protein have slight structural differences, so if you have information about an unknown bone protein, you can compare it to the information about known species of protein, so who knows, maybe you've found the matching information.
So she sent a piece of the puzzle to Mac, using the Federal Express.
Of course, you need to be very careful about the progress of the delivery.
Then he processed the sample, comparing it to 37 known modern mammal species.
The result was a pair!
The final conclusion is that Natalie discovered this 3.5 million-year-old skeleton in the Arctic Circle, and it comes from......
A camel is a camel.
I was wondering, what kind of joke is that? If we're not wrong, it's really wonderful.
So they tested a bunch of pieces, and got the same result for each piece.
However, judging by the size of the bone they found, this means that the camel was 30% larger than the modern camel.
So the camel is about 2.7 meters tall, and weighs about one inch.
(惊呼) Yes, yes.
Natalie discovered a giant northern camel.
Now that you hear the word camel, a picture appears in your mind: the twin-toed camel of East and Central Asia.
But more likely, the image in your mind is more like this: the unicorn camel, a typical desert animal, often dives in hot desert areas, such as the Middle East or the Sahara, with a very large ridge on its back, allowing it to store water for long journeys through the desert, and a wide paw, helping them to step on the dunes.
So how did these guys actually get to the Arctic Circle?
In fact, scientists knew long ago, even before Natalie's discovery, that camels originated in the Americas.
(Music: American National Anthem) They originated here.
In the 45 million years of camels' existence, 40 million years, you can only find them in North America, with a total of 20 different species, perhaps more.
 If we put them in a row, would they look different?
会啊, their body size varies greatly.zh
Some of the shells are particularly long, so they function very much like long reindeer.
Some have long noses, like the shark.
 They are particularly primitive, some of the earliest may be very small, almost like a little boy
What, a camel the size of a rabbit?
Some of the earliest are yes.
 Those you may not recognize anymorezh
Oh my god, I really want a camel to be a pet!
I know, this is going to be great, right?
Then, about three to seven million years ago, one branch of the camel migrated south to South America, where they evolved into American camels or sheep, another branch crossed the White Ridge, reaching Asia and Africa.
By the end of the last ice age, the North American camel had almost completely disappeared.
Well, scientists already know these things, but that doesn't fully explain how Natalie found camels in such a northern place.
Here, from a temperature standpoint, zh is simply the Saharan counter-terme.
In fact, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher than today.
So that could be a northern forest, a bit like today's Yuzhqua or Siberia.
However, they still have a six-month winter, all the ponds will be frozen.
You will encounter a snowstorm.
You will encounter a 24-hour continuous dark night.
What is going on?
How could these superstars of the Sahara desert survive in such harsh conditions?
Natalie and her colleagues felt that they had found the answer.
And this answer is quite clever.
What if these characteristics of camels were not as we think they were, but evolved to adapt to the environment of the Sahara, and to survive the harsh winters?
What if those broad paws were not to be used to step on a hill, but rather to step on a snowfield like snowboots?
If those camels were to be stored not for water but for fat, was the camel actually meant to survive the six-month-long cold winter of food scarcity?
What if, long after that, they crossed the mainland bridge, they modified these winter features to adapt to the hot desert environment?
For example, those humpbacks may be beneficial for camels in the hot zone, because when your fat accumulates in the same place, you know, like a fat backpack, it means that your body's insulation does not have to cover the whole body.
So this makes it easier to dissipate heat.
It was this crazy idea, that the camels would look like typical desert features, that suddenly turned them into evidence of their origin in the Arctic.
I'm not the first person to tell this story.
Others have said, either to praise the miracle of biological evolution, or to look at the future of climate change.
But I love this story so much for another reason.
For me, it's a story about us, about how we perceive the world, about how that perception changes.
My profession is as a historian.
I found that, in fact, many scientists are also historians.
They understand what happened in the past.
They tell of the history of the universe, the earth, and terrestrial life.
As a historian, you need to have a thought in your mind, thinking about how this story will proceed.
We tell stories, then we go along with the idea, like a camel in the desert, right?
 This is a fantastic story!  Camels are simply perfect for the desert
Obviously, camels have always lived there.
But at any given time, you may find some small clues.
You may discover something small, forcing you to re-imagine everything you think you know.
Like this example, the scientist who discovered this fragment, she also thinks it is wood, and it is because of this discovery that the scientific community has born a whole new, counterintuitive theory, explaining why this strange, long-horned creature has become what it is today.
To me, this completely upended my view of camels.
It went from a creature that existed only for this specific environment to a global traveler, only to happen to appear in the Sahara Desert, and could be anywhere at any time.
This is the grandfather.
zh, Azulik! are you all right?
Come on, I brought you something to eat.
Azul just finished her performance, coming from the Radio City Concert Hall in New York.
But that's not a joke.
And just in case... to be honest, my grandfather is here as a vivid example, explaining that the story of this world is changing in a moment.
We need to be proactive, bold to make changes, reimagine.
Azul, are you saying no?
Yes, we are just a fraction of a bone away from a whole new way of looking at the world.
Thank you all.
Today's computers are so magical that we even neglected how bad they actually are.
Today I am going to discuss this issue with you, and how we can solve it with neuroscience.
First, I want to take you back to a cold night in Harlem in 2011, a night that had profound meaning for me.
I was sitting in a bar next to Columbia University, majoring in computer and neuroscience, and I was having an interesting conversation with a classmate about the power of holographic photography, which would one day replace computers.
Just as our conversation was at its peak, his phone rang unexpectedly.
He picked up his cell phone, nodded and began typing.
Then he looked up at me from time to time and said, "Keep saying, I'm listening".
But it was obvious that his eyes were not focused, and in such a wonderful moment he passed away instantly.
Meanwhile, across the bar, I noticed another student holding his cell phone, surrounded by a crowd of people in front of this screen.
He's looking at the photos on Instagram, and these kids are laughing loudly.
Faced with the same technology, they felt so happy, while I felt unmatchedly frustrated, this stark contrast immediately stirred my thoughts.
As I thought deeper, I realized that clearly the problem here is not electronic information, but simply the location of the information displayed, which separates me from my friends, but brings these children together.
It is obvious that they are being linked by something, just as our ancestors evolved their social cognition, such as the story of the fire.
I think that's exactly what the tool should do.
They should extend our physical functions.
I think that today, computers are doing the exact opposite.
Whether you're emailing your wife, or giving her a symphony, or just comforting a friend, you're almost all using the same methods.
You're leaning against these squares, playing with buttons and menus, and more squares appear.
I think this is the wrong way, I think we can start using a more natural machine.
The machines we use should be able to bring our work back to real life.
We should use machines that can use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses, rather than limiting them.
Right now I'm right here with a machine like this.
It's called Meta 2.
Let's try and try it.
Now I can see the audience, and I can see my hands.
At the number 3,2,1, we will see a picture of a holographic photograph appear, a very real holographic photograph appear before me, appear before the glasses I am wearing now.
Of course, this could be anything we're planning to buy, or something we're learning, and I can easily control its movement with my hands.
And I think the Iron Man would be proud of it.
We'll wait a while and then come back.
(Applause from the audience) If you're like me, and you're probably already thinking about what you can do with this technology, let's look at some examples.
I'm an architect, so it's natural for me to imagine that the first thing to do is to draw a building in a three-dimensional shape, rather than drawing up a floor plan using these planes.
In fact, she is now touching a design drawing to choose an interior decoration.
These were all taken by the GoPro in my glasses.
The next use case, which is very personal to me, is the Glass Brain Project by Professor Adam Gozrej, thanks to the UCSF authorization.
As a neuroscience student, I've always been amazed at the ability of a real machine to learn and remember these complex brain structures, so I can touch and mess with different brain structures.
What you are seeing now is called augmented reality, but for me, it is just part of a more important story about how we started using digital devices to extend our bodies, rather than limiting our physical mechanisms.
So thenzhzh
In the next few years, humanity will experience a transformation, I think.
We will begin to cover an entire layer of digital information in the real world.
Take a moment to think about what this means for storytellers, what it really means for painters, brain surgeons, interior designers, and perhaps for everyone here today.
I think what we need to do as a group is really try and work hard to imagine how we can create this new reality, in a way that extends the human experience, rather than gameplaying our reality, or combining reality and digital information.
That's what I'm very interested in doing.
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.
In about five years, this will not be the smallest device, and in about five years, these devices will look like a linear lens placed in front of the eye, capable of projecting a holographic photographic image.
Just as we don't care about the hardware parameters of different phones, which phone we buy, considering the operating system, as a neuroscientist, I've always wanted to build a brain-based iOS, if possible.
It is very, very important that we make sure it works properly, because these things may not take as long to accompany us as we do when we contact the Windows image user interface.
I don't know about you, but living in a Windows system makes me feel a little scary.
To isolate the single most intuitive contact interface to infinity, we use neuroscience to guide our design, rather than letting a bunch of designers argue in the design room.
The principle of our evolution is called the minimum resistance neural tube.
At each moment of change, we connect the iOS brain system to our brain, for the first time, using our brain language.
In other words, we are trying to create a computer with a zero learning curve.
We are building a system that you all know how to use.
These are the first three design guides we used in this new user experience format.
First, you are an operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, requiring your brain to go around them in a number of ways.
We are going the opposite route to the  smallest resistance neural tubezh.
At the same time, in augmented reality, you can of course put your holographic images on the TED display here, put your holographic images on the other side of the table, and your spatial memory has evolved to extract this information accurately.
You can take a full-length photo of Tesla in online purchase here or any pattern my legal team tells me before I go on stage.
(Publisher laughs) Well, your brain does know how to get back to reality.
The second interface guide is what we call a visual contact guide.
When babies see things they are interested in, what do they do?
They will try to reach out and grab it.
This is how natural machines work.
The visual system actually receives a very basic impetus, which we can call the physical sensation, which is a feeling in the space of all parts of our body.
By directly contacting our work objects, we not only better control them, but also gain a deeper understanding of them.
This is what visual contact is.
But it is not enough to experience things ourselves.
We are the social pioneers.
This reminds me of our third guide, from our first story's h h:
Our mirrored nervous system shows that we can be better connected to each person and our work, if we can see a 3D image of each person's face and hands.
So, if you look at the video behind me, you can see two Meta users are operating the same holographic photo image, establishing eye-to-eye contact, focusing on this thing, rather than being distracted by external devices.
Let's try again with the concept of neuroscience.
Once again, our favorite interface is the iOS system of the brain.
I'm going to take a step forward, go to the front and grab these glasses, and then put them on the table right here.
I am with you at the moment, we are connected together.
My spatial memory is working, I can grab it in the past, then bring it back here, reminding myself that I am an operating system.
Now that my senses are working, I could have broken these glass pieces into thousands of pieces, and then touch the sensor in my hand, which is scanning the sensor right now.
But just seeing these is not enough, so soon, my co-founder, Ryan, will make a 3D phone call to me.
zh, Ryan, how are you?
Gentlemen, I can see this man in the form of a 3D projection before me.
And his images are very real.
(Applause from the audience) Thank you.
My mirror shows the neural system that will replace the telephone in the near future.
Ryan, how are you?
Ryan: I'm fine. We can finally do a live performance.
(Applause from the audience) Ryan, give us a little gift of a brain of photographic photography that we've seen in the short film before.
Gentlemen, this will not only change the way we make calls, but also the way we work together.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Ryan.
Ryan: It's not very hospitable.
(Publisher applause) Mallon Gribetz: So, guys, here's the message I found in that bar in 2011: The future of computers isn't locked inside these screens.
But it is here, in our bodies.
(Publisher's applause) So if I can leave you with an idea today, it is that the natural machine is not just a future-finding idea, it is right here, in 2016.
That's why at Metazh hundreds of employees, including executives, executives, designers, engineers, and engineers, will throw away their external display devices before TED2017, and replace them with a truly more natural machine.
Thank you very much.
(Applause from the audience) Thank you.
Thank you all.
Chris Anderson: I have a problem, there have been many exhibitions about holographic photography over the past year.
Sometimes there is a debate in the field of technology, about whether we really see things on screen?
This is a problem that exists in this field, and in some ways technology is showing a broader perspective than you actually see with glasses.
Have we just seen the real effect?
Maeron Gribetz: It is definitely a real effect.
Not only that, but we also used additional measurement techniques to shoot with GoPro through real lenses, getting all sorts of different shorts you see here.
We want to try to make the experience of this world a reality through what we see through the lens, rather than just seeing the local ones.
CA: Thank you so much for your presentation.
MG: Thank you very much.
I come from one of the freest, most tolerant, and most developed cities in America, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a wonderful Seattle family.
My mother was an artist, my father a university professor, and I am grateful for their upbringing, because I could fully plan my life independently in the way I felt right.
And in fact, my choices are not much different from what my parents thought.
When I was 19, I dropped out of college, or more accurately, was fired.
I set out on the road to becoming a professional Frenchman, my lifelong dream.
I have performed chamber music throughout the United States and Europe, toured for several years, and worked with the excellent jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
When I was in my twenties, I was excited to join the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a wonderful life!
And my parents never complained,
They have supported me from the beginning to the end.
Even if that wasn't their dream.
They used to talk to neighbors and friends about their son's decade-long break.
And there is a embarrassing conversation about my life that I want to share with you.
I was 27 years old, I was coming home from Barcelona, and it was Christmas, I went home to see my parents, and I was cooking dinner with my mother, and we were both in the kitchen.
She was silent, without a word.
I think there's something wrong with that.
I asked my mother, "What are you thinking?"
She said, "Your father and I are really worried about you.
I was surprised: What is it that you have to worry about now?
She replied: "I want you to answer my question honestly: Have you voted for the Republican Party?"
The truth is, I have no interest in politics, I'm just a French minor player.
But I understand a little bit, they noticed something, so they were confused.
I became a passionate champion of capitalism then, so let me tell you why.
Believe it or not, it is rooted in my ongoing research into poverty.
In Seattle, as a child, I remember the first time I was exposed to real poverty.
My family is in the lower middle class, but that's certainly not real poverty.
Not at all.
The first time I saw the real face of poverty was in the early 1970s, when I was only six or seven years old.
Like many of us, this example is quite ordinary.
It was a picture of a country in East Africa, a child almost as old as I was, flying in his face, his stomach swelling.
I know he's been through a lot, I know, but I can't help myself.
Some of you may remember such a painting, not necessarily exactly the same, but very similar.
It has shown the Western world the unbearable poverty of the rest of the world.
That kind of picture never left my mind, as I grew up, went to school, dropped out of school, and started to organize my own family.
I wonder what happened to that child afterwards?
Or what about people like him in other parts of the world?
I started to research this question, and even though I was not at university by then, I was still looking for answers: What happened to the world's poorest people?
Is it worse or better?
I finally found the answer, and it changed my life.
In fact, most Americans feel that from childhood, from the time they saw that scene to the present,
If you ask Americans: Is the global poverty problem worse or better? 70% of people will say that hunger has been worse since the early 1970s.
However, the reality is that this is so.
This was a moment that changed my mind, that made me realize.
Since 1970, the world has been in a state of hunger.The cost of living per day of less than a dollar has fallen by 80% since inflation corrected it.
Since I was a child, the percentage of the world's poorest people has decreased by 80 percent.
And I'm not sure that's true.
My friends, this is a miracle!
This is something that deserves to be celebrated.
This is the greatest achievement in the history of mankind against poverty, and it has taken place in our lifetime.
When I learned this fact, I wondered, what makes it possible to break poverty?
Because if you don't know why, it will only take a moment to get there.
We need to replicate success, to get the 200 million people still struggling in poverty out of poverty, because that's the question we've been talking about: Since I was a child, the two billion poorest people, our brothers and sisters, have been out of poverty.
I want to save the remaining two billion people, so I need to know why.
I was looking for answers,
It's not a political answer, because I don't care about the political answer at all.
And now, I still don't care.
I long for the best answers from mainstream economists - left, right and middle-class economists.
Below is the Zzhzh.
I'll start by talking about the specific reasons.
From childhood to the present, two billion people have been lifted out of poverty.
There are five reasons. First, globalization.
Second: free trade.
Third: the right to property.
第四章 The Law
Fifth: The entrepreneurial spirit.
These were the result of a free-market economy system that swept the world after 1970.
I'm not a childish person.
I know that free-market economics are not perfect, and I also know that free-market economics cannot satisfy all our needs to build a better world.
But it is great.
And it is beyond politics.
This is something I have learned and understood.
Capitalism is more than just the accumulation of capital.
Its greatness lies in the fact that it is related to ambition, as many on this stage have said, and is a dream-generated ambition, rooted in a free market system.
We must make this clear to more people.
Now, I'm going to talk about my second insight, it's related to the first one, and I believe it will not only promote the development of the world, but also the development of our country.
In other words, the idea of lifting people out of poverty is this: Free markets have created the greatest wealth in history.
And it has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.
Whose nickname?
Such as Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
You're wrong!
It was President Obama!
Why do I have a deep memory?
Because he told me.
I can't even think of a way to do that.
I said, "Hallelujah!"
Not only that, I also say, what a wonderful opportunity.
You know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, we held an event at Georgetown University about the topic we were working on.
At that time I thought about solving the biggest problem facing the United States today.
It is that whether liberals or conservatives, come together to discuss these ideas, to help those who need our help the most.
Needless to say, everyone here knows that we are in a crisis, in the United States and other countries with political divisions around the world.
This issue is already pressing.
This is not to be taken lightly.
Last year, an article was published in the Journal of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most influential and cutting-edge scientific journals in the West.
That was a 2014 article about political motivation due to asymmetry.
Psychologists describe this phenomenon as assuming that your thought idea is based on love, while the other person's thought idea is based on hate.
This is common in world-wide disputes.
For example, between Palestinians and Israelis.
The authors of this article found that in the United States today, a large portion of Republicans and Democrats are divided on political grounds.
Most of the political activists in our country today think they are motivated by love, while the rest are motivated by hatred.
Think about it.
Most people always say:  My thinking is based on charity, I want to help people, and the other part of the people, they are evil, they are trying to overthrow mezh
A society with such a division is unattainable.
This is impossible.
How should we solve this problem?
First, let's face it honestly: the differences exist.
We cannot reduce the differences, because that is childish behavior.
There is considerable in-depth research on this.
My friend Jonathan Haight is now a regular TED Fellow.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He studied the thoughts, values and moral concepts of different people, studying how they differed.
He proved that conservatives and liberals have very different views on what they consider important.
For example, Jonathan Hythe has pointed out that liberals care more about poverty than economic freedom 59% more.
Conservatives are 28% more concerned about economic freedom than poverty.
Seems like irreconcilable differences, doesn't it?
Can't we go together?
Our strength lies precisely in the midst of our differences.
Remember what stopped poverty:
It is the obsession and concern with poverty issues, and the free economic order worldwide.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people, we want to help another 200 million people out of poverty.
There is no other way.
︎.︎
What are we supposed to do?
That's a very subtle thing, isn't it?
We need to think in a new way.
Many innovative ideas are on this stage.
Yes, those extraordinary entrepreneurial minds of society.
We want to invest abroad in a sustainable, responsible, ethical way.
But do you know what we really need?
We need to open up a new heaven and a new earth with flexible thinking,
We need a few more predictable zh,
Isn't that right?
Have you ever felt your thoughts start to become predictable?
zh start to follow the rules?
Do you feel like you are always listening to someone who agrees with you?
Why is that so dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, we are always talking about taxes, rules and the rule of law.
On the other hand, liberals, when talking about the economy, always talk about income inequality.
They are important to me and important to you.
But when those who are starving need our help, these are all just distracting questions.
We should unite before the best approach, doing everything we can to reduce poverty, only when the conservatives realize they need liberals to care about poverty, and liberals need liberals to be obsessed with free markets.
Only if we choose this path, will such diversity produce the strong power of the future nation.
How can we achieve this goal, and how can we reach it together?
I have some practical advice, for you and for myself.
zh Action Code Article 1: Remember, just tolerating disagreements with others is not good enough,
Far from enough.
We must remember that we need those who disagree with us, because there is a group of people who need all of us to help, and they are still waiting.
What are you prepared to do and how will you behave?
Where do you start? and right here!
All of us here, we are all happy.
We have people who listen to us,
We are successful, we have leadership.
When people hear ideas of an ideology we don't know about, maybe they'll listen to us.
Perhaps this is the beginning of success.
This is the first point.
Point two: I ask you, and I ask myself, to become a specific individual with vague boundaries, to become a vague, indeterminate person.
If you are a conservative, then be a conservative who often hangs the issue of poverty on his lips, and a warrior who is determined to abide by moral obligations to fight for the poor.
If you are a liberal, do a complimentary liberal who is always attracted to the free market under which we operate responsibly.
If we do that, two targeted dates are forthcoming.
First, we are beginning to work on helping the next two billion people solve as many problems as we did before, and we will solve even more in the future.
The second is that we may be able to overcome this terrible ideological war that is making us suffer, turning it into a competition for ideas based on unity and mutual respect.
Perhaps one day it will be possible, just possible, that we will find that our so-called differences are not such irreconcilable differences.
Thank you!
At the time of the university, I was a senior in public administration, which meant I had to write a lot of papers.
When a typical student writes a paper, they might say something like this, dividing up the assignments.
So, you know, the start may be a little slow, but after a week, I've written a lot, then sometimes more, and finally everything worked out, and things don't work out.
I thought so too.
At least that's my plan.
I was ready to start, however, in fact, by the time I wrote my paper, I was already doing it.
And it's always the same every time I write a paper.
When it finally came time to write a 90-page dissertation, the dissertation that should have taken a year to write was finally completed.
I know that for a paper like this, my usual practice does not work.
Graduate thesis is a big project.
So I planned well, decided to do so.
This is how a year's work is arranged.
The first few steps, the middle months last a little longer, and the last high-speed steps go all the way up, like the stairs.
How difficult is it to climb the stairs?
It's not that big of a deal, is it?
But then something interesting happened.
At first, those first few months?
I came and went, practically doing nothing.
So we have this wonderful modification plan.
And then... the months between them have gone by so much, I basically didn't write a few words, so it turned out like this.
Then from two months to one month, and then again to only two weeks.
Then one day I suddenly realized that there were only three days left until the deadline, and I had not written a word, so I did the only thing I could: I spent 72 hours writing 90 pages, working all night for two days, people shouldn't be running two nights straight, running all over campus, slowly dipping in, and hurrying to submit papers before the deadline.
I thought that was how it all ended.
A week later, I got a phone call from the school.
They asked, "Are you Tim Alban?"
I said, "That's right".
They said, "We need to talk to you about the paper".
I answered, "Good".
The other person then said, "This is one of the best papers we've ever seen.
(Zh applause) That hasn't happened.
This paper is written very, very badly.
I just wanted to enjoy this moment, when you all thought, "This guy is too cool!"
No, that paper is super-bad.
Anyway, I'm a blogger now.
I wondered if I could write a blog for the sake of breaking the sand.
A few years ago, I decided to write an article about procrastination.
My procrastination behavior always confuses those around me who don't, so I want to explain to those who don't, what the procrastinator thinks and why we do it.
My assumption is that the brains of the procrastinators and the brains of the non-proliferators are different.
To prove this, I found a nuclear magnetic resonance lab that allowed me to scan my own brain and a confirmed non-delaying brain, and then I could compare the two types of brains.
Today I brought them all.
I hope you can make a serious comparison whether there is any difference between the two.
I know you're not trained brain experts, and it may seem unobtrusive, but let's take a look, shall we?
This is the brain of a non-retardant.
zh now,
This is my brain.
There is a difference between the two.
In both types of brains, there is a rational decision maker, but in the brain of the procrastinator, there is also a momentary satisfaction.
What does this mean for the procrastinators?
It means that everything was fine before this happened.
[Now is the best time to start working.] [not yet!] So when a rational decision maker makes rational decisions, wanting to do something productive, but not wanting to do so, Zhengzhou takes control of the steering wheel, and says: "Well, actually, let's read the Wikipedia story about the South Korean-Krigen/Juni Yahardin scandal, because I just thought of it.
Then let's go to the fridge, look around the last 10 minutes, there's nothing new.
Then, let's continue browsing through the video site, starting with Richard Feynman's magnetic video, always watching an interview with Justin Bieber, the old man who saw the earth's oldest desolation.
All of this takes time, so our schedule today is not a vacuum.
I'm sorry about that!
What's going on with that?
The instant gratification doesn't seem to be the person you want him to handle the steering wheel with.
He is fully alive in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, he only cares about two things: simple and happy.
In the animal world, that's fine.
If you were a dog and lived a simple, happy life, it would have been a huge success!
For the humans, the human race is another animal.
You sleep well, eat well, breed well, and in the tribal era, that might be fine.
But, in case you haven't noticed, we're not living in the tribal era.
We live in an advanced civilization, and the people of the world don't understand what that is.
That's why there's another guy in our heads, a rational decision maker, who has given us the ability to do things other animals can't.
We can see the future.
We can look at the bigger picture.
We can make long-term plans.
And he wanted to take all of these into consideration.
He wants us to do whatever is worth doing right now.
Sometimes doing simple pleasurable things is meaningful, such as eating, sleeping, or enjoying the right amount of leisure time.
That is why there is a overlap between instant gratification and rational decision makers.
Sometimes they agree.
But sometimes, it is more meaningful to do things that are more difficult and less enjoyable, which is for the greater good.
At this point, a conflict will arise between the two.
For the procrastinator, each conflict ends this way, which is that he spends a lot of time in the Zhongs, which is the area that is simple and happy, but also has no meaning.
I call this area a dark playground.
The dark playground is a place where all procrastinators know.
This is the place for recreational activities when it should not be.
The joy of being in a dark playground is not joy, because it is completely unprofitable, and it will lead to self-doubt, fear, anxiety, self-loathing.
And the question is, in this case, how can the delayer get himself to the blue zone, where, although not so comfortable, there are many important things to do?
In fact, the procrastinator has a guardian angel, who is always invisible and watches over him, and in those darkest moments it is called the panic monster.
The panic monster is mostly in hibernation, but when the deadline is near, or when he is in dire danger in public, or facing a career disaster, or other dire consequences, he wakes up suddenly.
And most importantly, he is the only thing that Zhongs is afraid of.
Recently in my life, the "panic monster" has become quite important, because TED staff contacted me six months ago, inviting me to give a speech.
Of course, I promise you that.
I used to dream of giving a TED talk.
(Applause) But amid this excitement, rational decision makers seem to be thinking of something else.
He would say: zh are we clear about what we just promised?
Do we now have the ability to complete that task in the future?
We have to sit down and start working.
And Zhong said:zh totally agree, but let's open Google Earth, push the camera 200 feet underground in India, and then spend two and a half hours rolling up to the top of the country's map, so we can feel India better.
That's what I did that day.
When six months turned into four months, then two months, then one month, TED staff started releasing speakers.
I opened the website to see my face and look at myself.
Guess who's up this time?
So the panic monster went crazy, and within seconds, the whole system was in chaos.
And the monkey, remember, frightened by the sound of a panicked monster, climbed up the tree!
So finally, the rational decision maker can finally control the steering wheel, and I can begin to prepare for this talk.
To the horror monster, all those rather stupid procrastination acts, like someone like me who spent two weeks without even being able to start writing the paper's foreword, then miraculously regained an incredible work zeal and wrote 8 pages overnight.
The whole situation, plus the three characters, is a system of procrastinators.
Not good, but at least it's still useful.
This is something I decided to write a few years ago on my blog.
After its release, I was surprised by the response.
I received thousands of emails from people from all over the world, doing all sorts of different things.
There are nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many PhD students.
zh content is basically different:  I have this question too
But what impressed me was the contrast, the light tone of the post and the heavy tone of those emails.
These people have a strong sense of frustration because procrastination affects their lives, because their thoughts are controlled by the ego.
After thinking about it, my question is, if the system of delayers can work, what happens?
Why is it that all these people have such a dark corner?
As a result, I discovered that there were originally two kinds of delays.
The examples I discussed today, and those mentioned above, all have deadlines.
When there is a deadline, the effect of delay is limited to a shorter period because the panic monster will intervene.
But for the second kind of delay, it occurs without a deadline.
For example, if you are thinking about starting your own business or doing a work of art, there is no deadline at the beginning, because nothing will happen until you start working hard, without generating momentum to keep things going.
Things that are important beyond work also don't have a deadline, such as seeing your family, or exercising to stay healthy, trying to improve romantic relationships, or leaving an unhappy relationship.
If the delayers do these difficult things only with one mechanism, the panic monster, then the problem arises, because in the absence of these deadlines, the panic monster will not appear at all.
When he does not need to wake up, the consequences of delay are unlimited, they will only be prolonged indefinitely.
And this long-term delay is less obvious and less frequently discussed than the more interesting, shorter, and deadline-based delay.
It usually affects us quietly.
It may be the source of a great deal of long-term unhappiness.
I guess that's why those people are sending emails, that's why they're in such a bad situation.
Not because they're crazy about a project, but because they're crazy about it.
Rather, it is this prolonged delay that makes them feel that they are sometimes just a bystander in their own lives.
Their frustration is not that they cannot achieve their dreams; it is that they cannot even begin to pursue their dreams.
So after reading these emails, I realized that I don't think there are people who are not procrastinating.
Yeah, I think we all are procrastinators.
You may not be like us, you are a mess in every way, maybe some people can be good at dealing with deadlines, but remember: the worst trick of the year is to have no deadline.
Now I want to show you the same thing for the last time.
I call it the calendar of life.
Suppose a person can live to be 90, every week is a pattern.
In fact, there are not many of them, especially since we have lived for so many years.
I think we all need to take some time, take a serious look at this life calendar.
We need to think seriously about what we're really putting off, because everyone is putting off something.
We must instantly realize that we are in a position to satisfy this need immediately.
This is something we should all do.
And because there are not many grids, this work should probably start today.
Well, maybe not today, but...
You know what I mean.
In the near future.
Thank you very much.
We were there...souls and bodies crammed into a Texas church, that was the last night of our lives.
Just like now in our room, except that there is a bunch of rustling woodworkers, hanging from a broken red ribbon, an organ on my left, a choir behind me, and a baptismal font built on the back wall.
It's like this room.
Equally strong suspicions, equally profound thirst for salvation, equally bitter sweat in the heart, and the same number of absent-minded people in the back row.
It was December 31, 1999, the night, as far as I know, Christ's return to the world, the world will be coming to an end.
I was 12 years old, and I was of the age to be responsible.
I felt that Jesus' return was so unfair, I was going to be held responsible for everything I had done before, but when I stopped complaining, I thought I'd better get my house cleaned up and tidy up.
I go to church as often as possible.
I was afraid of a moment of silence, just as people are afraid of noise, only to repeatedly acknowledge that God had not taken me, and to return early and drop me off.
But if he really came early, I also had a backup plan, which I read from the end of the day's disappearance in the wind.
I see in the text that if after the midnight rave I am not taken away, I still have a chance.
All I need is not to be crowned by pagan names, defeat the devil, overcome the plague, and overthrow the antichrist.
It will be quite difficult, but I am confident that I can do it.
But it's too early to prepare.
It is already 11:50 pm.
With 10 minutes left, the priest asked us to get up from the table and walk to the altar below, because he wanted us to pray together at midnight.
So the assembly was divided into several groups, reaching a designated place.
The choir is also on the small stage, the church rector and his wife, and I prefer to call them the "baptized bourgeoisie" and sit in the first row in front of the altar.
You know, in the United States, even on the night of Christ's return, there are VIP seats.
And just behind the battered bourgeoisie, there are old men and women whose young backs are exposed to the sun in the cotton fields of East Texas, whose faces along the gorge are burned to a noble brown, like the clay of East Texas, and whose beautiful fantasies and dreams about life and the world outside East Texas are sometimes more crippled than their backs.
Yes, these men and women are my idol, my star.
They waited for this moment for a long time, as their medieval forefathers longed for the end of the world, as my grandmother longed for the Oprah Winfrey Show, broadcast daily at four o'clock on Channel 8.
As she walked to the altar, I slipped behind her, because I was so sure that my grandmother was going to heaven.
I thought, if I could hold her hand in this prayer, I might go with her.
So I grabbed it, closed my eyes, listened, waited.
The voice of prayer has become louder.
In response to the cry of the voice of prayer, the cry was also greater.
The organ is played, intertwined with the sound of the singing.
The heat wave is rippling, and the sweat of the hands and the heart is more acidic.
My hands are getting tighter, and I don't want to be abandoned by God.
My eyes are closing tightly, and I don't want to see the elegance taken away, the crap dropped.
Suddenly a voice echoed from the top of his head: 阿门zh.
It's over.
I watched the clock.
It's already past midnight.
I watched the elderly believers, their Savior had not come, they were too proud to show even a single drop, they had not believed too deeply, too long, now it was too late to doubt.
But I'm angry with them.
They were fooled, deceived, deceived, and yet I was also deceived along with them.
I prayed for them, I fought hard to resist the desires of my heart.
I did not once, but twice, one planted in that cold-hearted baptism pool.
I used to believe in it.
What do we do now?
I went home and turned on the TV, just caught up with Peter Jennings announcing the new millennium, and the whole world was celebrating the new year.
I suddenly realized, strange as it may seem, that Jesus would return to the people again and again, simply because the time zones were different in different places.
It made me feel more painful, hurt, really.
But that very night, I didn't stop believing.
I just believe in one more thing: that it is possible to not believe.
It is likely that the answers I know are all wrong, and it is likely that the question itself is wrong.
Now, at the peak of the faith once established, there is a spring of water flowing continuously to the foot of the mountain, a questionable pure spring, which is destined to become the Grand River.
All the dramatic stories of my life, all of them dating back to that night in the church, when my Savior did not come; I am more convinced of what, if not called a lie, is at least not the truth.
While most of you have a very different approach to the Millennium, I am sure you are here because some of you have done the same thing as I did, the things that happened after the beginning of the new century, the death of my mother, the departure of my father, the absence of my Savior.
I stretched out my hands, searching hard for a hint of something I could believe.
When I was 18 years old and went to Yale University, I was looking for, I believe, a way from a small town in Texas, to get rid of all the hardships and hardships I've been through, to get rid of those broken dreams, disabled bodies.
But when I returned home in the winter, my head was tied to the ground, my hands were tied behind my back, a thief's gun was over my head, I knew that even the best education could not save me.
When I went to the Lehman Brothers internship in 2008, I was looking for it too.
I was so excited to call my family and tell them we'd never be poor again.
But when I look at this financial temple as it is torn apart before my eyes, I know that even the best work will not save me.
When I arrived in Washington, D.C. as a young journalist, I searched, and I heard a voice in Illinois: (referring to Obama's campaign speech)  Time has passed too long, but right now in this election,  America will usher in change
But when parliamentary work stalled, the country nearly collapsed, and so-called hope and change became a cruel joke, I knew that even a new political life could not save me.
I worship before the sacred altar of the American dream, praying to the great men of my time, praying for success, praying for money, praying for power.
But every time the midnight bell rang, I opened my eyes and saw these myths all die.
From this tomb, I began to search again, not because I was brave, but because I knew that if I had no faith, I would die.
So I went to another holy place to worship, Harvard Business School, and this time I knew I could not simply accept the ransom offered by the college.
No, I know I have more to do.
It all started in the dark corner of a crowded party, that night in the middle of a brutal first winter in Massachusetts, when three friends and I asked a question that some young people with a true passion for it would ask for a long time: How do we go out for a self-driving trip?
We don't know where or how to go, but we know we must start.
Because we long for what we have all been after, as Jack Kerouac wrote: "Deple into an endless dark night, disappear into the distant skies".
So even if there were voices of opposition, saying we had taken too much risk, and that we had not harvested anything, we were still on the move.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled 13,000 miles across the United States, past a Montana cattle ranch, past a deserted city in Detroit, past a swamp in New Orleans, and there we found some people, worked for them, started small businesses, and set goals as a bottom line.
After studying at the capitalist West Point Military School, we discovered that this idea was simply revolutionary.
This idea spread, eventually growing into a nonprofit organization called the American Society of Civil Engineers, which is the main reason I am able to stand on stage today.
It is spread because we have found in this generation a strong desire, a desire to achieve goals, a value in life.
It's spread because we've found countless entrepreneurs in every corner of the country, creating jobs, changing his life, and needing a little help.
But to tell the truth, it is able to spread, also because I am determined to spread it.
There is nothing I have not done, to convince more people that we can heal the wound of this fractured country, relying on a small business.
But that is the process of evangelization, leading me to a little different gospel, which I want to share with you today.
Starting about a year ago one night, we attended a Harvard Business School alumni dinner at the Natural Science Museum in New York.
Beneath a full-size model of a shark, I sat in line with the giants of this age, singing praises to their companions, and their greatness.
The room was filled with a proud atmosphere, and the total assets under these names combined exceeded $500 billion.
We look at all creation, and we think it is good.
But this is what happened: Two days later, I went to the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, sat on a city farm, where there was an abandoned parking lot, and listened to a man named Tony talk about some children who would go there every day.
All of them live below the poverty line.
Many people have put all their belongings in their backpacks, fearing that they will be stolen from the shelter.
Some people came to Tony's farm, called the Zheng Haring Growth, to get their only meal a day.
Tony told me that he started the growth of Haringey with his own pension, and that he worked as a taxi driver for 20 years.
He said he had not left himself a penny, because although the project was a success, the resources were still extremely scarce.
He said, "Any help he can find, he will accept".
And I am going to help him.
But when I left Tony, I had a heart attack, a sore, wet eye.
I felt the burden of enlightenment, one night I could sit in a room and talk to hundreds of people worth half a billion dollars about the wonderful world, yet two days later in another room, just 50 blocks away, a man without pay was supposed to provide his children with a single meal a day.
Yet it is not this sharp social inequality that makes me so excited, nor are these hungry, homeless children, nor the anger toward the 1% or pity toward the 99% who live there.
No, I can't calm down because I finally realized that this country needs a radical change, and I'm just a little bit of a fix.
I realized that my story represented a group of people, people who wanted them to be able to live on their own, even if they were a little bit of a mess; what my organization represented, all-basic, systemic help, never reached the Harbin area, or the Appalachian Mountains and the Lower Nine of New Orleans; my screams represented some sounds, sounds that sounded meaningless, unmodified, unattainable.
And this shame, this shame washed me away, like the shame of sitting in front of the TV watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, over and over and over again.
I was fooled, deceived, deceived,
But this time, the hypocritical savior was myself.
You know, I walked from that sacred altar, that night I felt the world was about to fall, from a small town that spoke different languages, thinking that suffering was a gift from God to mankind, but also that it was a creed, an eternal truth.
Yes, my journey was too long, so I went back to my original place.
Because we cannot simply summarize, saying that this age has no faith.... No, we believe in something as we have always believed in something.
Some people may believe the prophecies of Bryn Brown or Tony Robbins.We may believe the proverbs of the New York Times or the Harvard Business Review.
We may have unparalleled belief in the things we worship in our TED churches, but we are extremely anxious to believe, we need faith.
We imitate the talk and behavior of leaders who are charming and committed to solving all human problems.
We feel that suffering is a gift from God to us, and we view the development of technology as a creed, as an eternal truth.
But we never realized the humanitarian cost we paid, and we wouldn't question a single piece of the puzzle, because we were afraid the whole building would collapse.
But if you are disturbed by the unnatural things we are used to doing, then the time for questioning is surely coming.
So the gospel I preach is not about breakthroughs, innovation, or sustainable development.
I don't even have any gospel of faith to share with you.
My only hope is the gospel of doubt.
The gospel that is questioned does not stop you from believing, it asks you to believe something new:  Not believing is also possible
It is likely that the answers we know are all wrong, and it is likely that the question itself is wrong.
Yes, the Gospel in question may mean that our existence, on this stage, in this room, is completely wrong.
Because it raises a question: Why?
We have such a powerful power in our hands, why is there anyone still in the heat of the water?
This question led me to make a decision, the organization I founded, to stop operating.
We have disbanded the staff, shut down the gang, and we are opening this model to everyone, as long as they feel they are capable of doing it, without our approval.
This doubt forced me to remove the hat of the Savior from my head, because our life is too short, too low a chance, and we cannot wait for Christ's return.
And this question, it drives me, it gives me hope, when hardship is about to overwhelm us, when the path of destiny seems to lead us astray, when our Savior cannot heal the wound, not our blind faith, but our simple question, will shine a little light on the darkness of our life and the world.
喊也行, or simply say, very simply say: zh must, there is another way
Thank you very much.
The food crisis.
It appears in the daily news.
What is that?
In some parts of the world, food is scarce, in some places food is abundant.
In some places, genetically modified foods have saved the world.
Maybe genetically modified food is a problem?
Too much genetically modified agricultural wastewater has produced polluted oceans, toxic seawater, and nutrient deficiencies.
This cycle continues over and over again.
I find that the current discussion is in fact too little influential.
How can we make such a discussion understandable to everyone?
What about the food crisis?
I'm sure, in the past week, each of you have eaten one apple.
How long do you think it took Apple to pick it up and get it in your hand?
zh two weeks?
Two months?
11 months - that's the average time the apple sold in the US market from harvest to sale.
I think in Europe it should be more or less the same as in almost all parts of the world.
We picked apples, stored them in the refrigerator, and put oxygen in the refrigerator-- in fact, documented records show that workers tried to enter such an environment to retrieve an apple, and then died, because the air in the refrigerator in such an environment was toxic to humans.
Why is it that none of you know about this?
Why didn't I know about this?
90% of the nutrients in the fruit - all the antioxidants in the fruit - were lost when we bought it.
It's just a little candy.
Why are we ignorant of these news, and how can we improve this situation?
I think we're missing a platform.
I know platforms - I use computers, and when I was very young, I was active online.
I've done a lot of very strange things - on a platform like this.
But I also met others, and I was able to express my thoughts.
What is your view of food?
If we had a platform, we might find this question very helpful.
I want to ask: if climate is democratic?
This is a distributed global climate map.
The most efficient agricultural production areas are green, the worst being red.
They will change, change, the farmers of California now become Mexican farmers.
China gained land from Brazil in order to grow better food, and we are all slaves to the environment.
What if every country had its own climate for production?
How will that change our lives?
How will it affect the quality of our lives and nutrition?
The problem facing the previous generation is that we need more food and the price is cheaper.
Welcome to the world farm.
We built a huge simulation farm.
These lines trace tracks--they are cars, planes, trains and cars.
zh being able to provide enough food for seven billion people, which is a miracle, with very few people involved in the process of food production.
But if you...
Are we building a digital farm?
The world's digitized farm.
If you could take this apple, to some extent, digitize it, transmit it through the air through the mass points, and then rearrange the mass points on the other side?
What if?
Look at these quotes, you know, they encouraged me to do so.
First article: Japanese agriculture has no youth, no water, no land, no future This is the day I arrived in South Satsuo Town, which is, Fukushima, and then South Satsuo, after the nuclear power plant accident
All the children went to Sendai and Tokyo, where the land was contaminated by the nuclear power plant accident, and their food imports reached 70 percent.
But this is not unique to Japan.
Only 2% of the population of the United States is engaged in agricultural work.
What answer does this give us about 2% of the population engaged in agriculture?
If we look elsewhere in the world, 50% of Africa's population is under the age of 18.
Eighty percent of them do not want to become farmers.
Agriculture is too difficult.
The life of a small farmer is too difficult.
They chose to go to the city.
In India: Farmers' families cannot access basic agricultural tools, and farmers commit suicide more than in the past 10 years.
It's too sad to mention these things.
Where are they going?
To the city.
Without young people, young people are all going to the city.
So what kind of platform should we build to encourage young people?
Please take a look at this new tractor.
This is my joint harvesting machine.
A few years ago, I went to a home-made chain store and started looking for tools.
I made stupid things, I made plants dance, I connected them to my computer, and then I destroyed them-- lots of them.
I eventually made them survive.
I have created one of the most intimate relationships of my life, because I am most familiar with plant languages.
I want them to grow bigger.
They said, "Child, go as far as you can!"
This is an electronics studio that nobody uses.
What can you do about it?
Together with team members, we built a farm in the Media Lab, a place that was previously thought to be connected to electronic life rather than biological ones.
In this 60 square meter space, we have produced enough food to feed about 300 people a month - not too much.
There are a lot of interesting technologies out there.
What's the most interesting thing?
Beautiful, white rootstocks, deep green plants, and once a month harvest.
Is this a new restaurant?
Is this a new sales experience?
Is this a new style store?
I can confirm this: This is the first time any plant can be uprooted in a media lab.
We put the salad in the bag; nothing was wrong.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, a robotics expert, even root out a plant and think, zh, I know about-- I can make a plan happen, I want to try it one time.
During the whole process, we will take out plants and take some back to the lab, because if you grow them yourself, you will not throw them away; because they are precious to you.
I have this strange tongue now, because I don't want anyone to eat them before me, I hope it's delicious.
I eat vegetables every day, and I know that the pH of vegetables is less than 1.
I am like this now, no, it's 6.1 - no, you can't eat it today.
(Applause) This green vegetable is very sweet that day.
That's because vegetables feel a lot of pressure, and it produces a chemical reaction to protect itself: I don't want to die!
The taste of the plant that does not want to die is sweet.
Scientists are returning to the study of plant physiology.
I think everyone can try to participate.
We look forward to seeing your work, so we envisioned a laboratory that could be transported elsewhere.
To produce such a conception.
The front of this media lab building is my lab, with 30 sensing points for each plant.
If you know the genome or genetics, that's the ZH form group, right?
The phenomenon in which a sample group is presented.
When you say, "I like Mexican grass", what you really like is grass grown in such climatic conditions.
You can code climate like this - how much carbon dioxide, how much oxygen  the recipe created zh - and you can control the presentation of plants, as well as their nutrient content,  the size, shape, color and texture of plants, by programming.
We need data, so we put a lot of sensors in to provide us with data.
You can think back to the plants in your home, you look at the plants in your home  sad because you wonder  why you died?zh Will you talk to me?zh
Farmers had the most beautiful eyes for the future, and when they were sixty-seven years old,
They can tell you that the plant's death was due to soil shortages, lack of soil, or that it needed a more humid air environment.
These beautiful eyes will never pass away.
These are the eyes of the peasantry.
We will continue to collect data and information.
We combined these data points with separate plants.
These are the IP address data of all the flowers in my lab that day.
We have a traceable IP address.
(Applause) If that's not weird enough, you can click here to see the plant archives.
This shows you the growing process of that plant strain that can be downloaded, not as you imagine, but informing you not only when it is edible.
When does its nutrition meet my needs?
When does its taste match my expectations?
Is there too much water?
Is the sun out too long?
The city would suggest.
It can communicate with me, communicate with me, we can communicate in language.
(ZZh applause) I guess that was the first user of the plant Facebook, right?
At that time the plant archives of the botanical society began to make friends.
I'm telling the truth--the botanical society started with friends who use fewer, more, less, more, less, more, more, less.
We will begin to understand the complexities of what can now only be guessed.
They may not be friendly with us--I don't know, maybe they'll make up with us, depending on our behavior.
This is my current lab.
It's a little more systematic, my background is designing a hospital's data center, and I know how to create a controllable environment.
So -- in this environment, we experiment with all sorts of things.
This program, the Air Planting Method, was developed by NASA for the Milwaukee Space Station, which can reduce the amount of water they need to transport to space.
What this program does is precisely provide the plants with what they want. Water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots are not so complex that when you pass them on, you can see the amazing results.
Plants have two hearts.
Because it has two hearts, it has a rapid growth rate of 4-5 times greater than normal.
This is a perfect world.
We have experienced a long technological development in search of a different world. We will continue to do so, but we will also have new tools, which will be a perfect world.
We grow a wide variety of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercially produced in the past 150 years.
Did you know we have a rare, old-fashioned seed bank?
The seed bank.
That's a lot of fun.
They have a living variety of food you haven't eaten.
I am the only person in this room who has ever eaten such a tomato.
The problem is, this is a tomato juice we don't know how to cook, so feeling like a tomato juice doesn't seem to be good.
But we've planted a variety of protein-containing things.
We've planted humans - you might, but we won't.
We realized that the tools were too big and too expensive.
I started placing them all over the world, worth about $100,000.
It's not easy to find someone who can handle $100,000 at will, so we wanted to make small tools.
This is actually a project of one of my students-- a mechanical engineering undergraduate student, Kamilzh.
Kamil and I, along with my team, spent the entire summer rehearsing how to make it cheaper, how to operate better, and how to make others learn to operate.
Then we send these tools to school for children in grades 7 through 11.
If you want to be humble, try teaching your child something to do.
I went to this school and said, "I set the humidity at 65%".
A child in seventh grade asked,  what is the humidity?zh
So I said,zh, it's water in the air.
He said, "There's no water in the air, you little egg".
So I said, "Well, don't believe me".
In fact-- don't trust me, will you?
Set it to 100zh.
He set the humidity to 100, what happened?
 start to freeze, produce mist, and eventually start to drip water
Then he said,, humidity is rain.
Why didn't you tell me that before?
The interface we create looks like a game.
They have a 3D environment, and can be accessed anywhere in the world, from cell phones, computers, and computers.
There are different parts to the program - physical adjustment, sensor.
They chose recipes that children from other parts of the world had already created.
They select and activate the recipe, plant seeds and soak them.
As the seeds grow, the children can make changes.
They say, "Why do plants need carbon dioxide?
can make a person suffocate.
zh increase the supply of carbon dioxide, plants die.
 Lowering the amount of carbon dioxide, and plants live well
Harvesting plants, you have created a new e-currency.
It is a repeated process of design and development and exploration.
They can download all the data of the new plant they have developed, or a new electronic menu that did something-- better or worse?
Imagine these are a core element of processing.
We can learn a lot from them.
This is a computer we call a food computer, which is placed in a school for three weeks.
This is a three-week planting period.
More importantly, for the first time, this child thinks he can be a farmer - or, he wants to be a farmer.
So we're making these resources public.
They were all put online; go home, try building your first food computer.
It's going to be hard-- let me tell you that.
We are in the early stages, but the resources are there.
For me, making these easy to achieve is very important.
We will continue to do so as well.
These are farmers, electronic engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, urban planners.
On one platform, do what they each are best at.
The team has become too big.
This is my new experimental device that is just starting to work.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
In this warehouse we are going to build a shelf like this.
Now you can see it.
Look at this one,
This is also true.
One planted green vegetables, one planted an Ebola vaccine.
It is amazing that plants and this successful project of the US Department of Defense Office of Advanced Research Projects are the reasons why we have been studying Ebola virus disease effectively.
These plants are producing proteins that fight against Ebola.
So medicines and health products, and then back to growing vegetables.
But the two things seem completely different, and that's my part in my own field.
But a lot of things are not as they seem.
We're still at this stage, right? Like, this is my little black box -- no, buy mine.
No, no, no -- my intellectual property is absolutely valuable.
Don't buy this one, buy mine.
The truth is, we are only in the beginning stages, and at this time, society is also changing.
While we wanted more, cheaper food, we now need better quality, environmentally friendly food.
But you see the ingredients of McDonald's advertising, the most mysterious food in human history - McDonald's marketing program is changing - everything is changing.
Now look at the world today.
 Personal food computer, food server, food data center, operating in an open-source group 
It's like a public genome, but we're going to have to compile a little bit of climate recipes, like Wikipedia, you can turn, start, plant.
What does this look like?
Remember how the world was connected by a string?
Bacon is beginning to appear.
We started sending out food-related messages, rather than distributing food.
This is not just my fantasy, it is work we are already doing.
 Food computers, food servers,  fast food data centers, connect people together to share information
The future of food is not its fault, but its struggle.
We all know there's something wrong with that.
The future of food is about connecting the next generation of one billion farmers, and empowering them with a Q&A platform, if?
Thank you very much.
Sometimes I feel very ashamed as a European.
Last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe who needed our help, and our response was sad, to say the least.
There are too many contradictions here.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old boy Alan Cody, however, since then more than two hundred children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international conventions that recognize that accepting refugees is a shared responsibility of all countries, yet we accept more Syrians than the entire European Union receives from a small area of Lebanon.
We condemn the existence of human trafficking, yet we make it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe.
We lack a manpower, yet we prevent people who can meet our economic and population-building needs from entering Europe.
We claim that our liberal values are contrary to those of the Islamic fundamentalist movement, however--we use a high-pressure policy of detaining child asylum seekers, separating children from their families, forcibly confiscating refugee property.
What are we doing?
How did things turn out to this point? We are dealing with a humanitarian crisis in an inhuman way.
I don't believe it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it.
I think this is because our politicians lack vision  lack of how to adapt to what was proposed fifty years ago  to cope with a changing and globalizing world.
So what I want to do is take a step back and ask two very basic questions.
First of all, why does the existing system not work?
Secondly, how do we solve the problem?
The modern refugee system was created after World War II by these people.
Its original purpose was to ensure that when a country collapses or worse, when the regime is hostile to the people of that country, these people can find a place to flee and live in safety and dignity until they can return to their homeland.
This is exactly what we are seeing in Syria today.
Through the 1951 International Conference on the Status of Refugees, co-signed by 147 governments, and an international organization, UNHCR, UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the member states pledged to allow foreigners into their territories to flee conflict and persecution.
But now this system is collapsing.
zh Theoretically zh refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policy has blocked this path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek equal treatment or the right to choose to return to their homeland.
But in the actual operation they were trapped in a state of almost infinite stagnation.
In theory, the refugee problem is the responsibility of all countries.
In fact, geographic location means that the vast majority of refugees are overloaded in the countries in conflict.
The provisions of the original refugee system were not the cause of its collapse.
It is not that we are not using them enough to keep pace with the changing world, but that we need to reconsider.
So I would like to explain to you how the current system works.
How does the current refugee reception system work?
But this is not a macro-level view from above, but from the perspective of individual refugees.
So imagine a Syrian woman.
We will call her Amirazh for the time being.
Amira represents many of the refugees I have met in the region.
Amira, like about a quarter of the world's refugees, is a woman with a child who cannot return home because of her city, the city of Holmes that you see now.
Therefore, Amira was unable to return to Zzh.
Amira also has no hope of relocating to a third country because that is like the Chinese lottery, which is only accessible to less than one percent of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family were faced with an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first is that Amirazh can take her family to a refugee camp.
In the refugee camp, she may be helped, but the outlook for Amira and her family is very poor.
Camping in a desolate, impoverished land is usually in the middle of the desert.
In the Zataliyah civilian camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of shelling across the Syrian border at night.
zh economic activity is restricted there.
The quality of education is usually very poor.
And around 80 percent of the world's refugees in refugee camps should not be left there for at least five years.
This is a disastrous place, which may explain why only nine percent of Syrians actually chose this option.
Or Amira can travel to a city in a neighboring city such as Amman or Beirut.
Seventy-five percent of Syrian refugees choose this option.
But even there, it is difficult to find.
zh refugees within cities usually do not have the right to work.
They usually do not have access to the channels through which assistance is obtained.
So when Amira and her family spent their basic savings, they were left with little left, and they were likely facing poverty.
There is a third option that is being chosen by a growing number of Syrians.
Amira can find hope for her family by embarking on a dangerous journey that could lead to death and death, to another country.
Globally, we leave refugees with an almost impossible choice of these three options  refugee camps  urban poverty and dangerous travel
For refugees, this choice is the current global refugee system.
But I feel like this is a wrong choice.
I think we can reconsider this choice.
The reason we restricted these options is because we thought they were the only options that refugees could get, but in fact they weren't.
Politicians have cast it as a lost issue and if refugees benefit, citizens will have to bear the loss.
We seem to agree with the assumption that refugees are an inevitable burden and cost to society.
But this is not a formal process.
So what I want to prove is that we can increase that option and still benefit everyone: including the host country and the community, our society and the refugees themselves.
I would like to propose four ways to change our established view of refugees.
All four pathways have one thing in common: We have all taken advantage of globalization, social mobility and market opportunities to update our understanding of refugee issues.
The first thing I want to consider is the concept of creating an environment that comes from a most basic cognitive understanding that refugees, like everyone else, are simply in a specific environment.
I and colleagues at Oxford University have started a research project in Uganda that studies the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it was a typical representative of the host country.
It's actually an exception.
Unlike most of the world's host countries, Uganda, has been providing refugees with economic opportunities.
zh give them the right to work  give them freedom of action
The results of this have been astounding, both for refugees and for the host country.
In Kampala, Uganda's capital, we found that 21 percent of refugees started their own businesses and employed others.
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for the citizens of the host country.
Even in the refugee camp, we have found examples of dynamic, prosperous start-ups.
In a refugee camp called Nakhiwale, we found Congolese refugees who were in the business of trading digital music.
We found the business of Rwanda refugee  allowing young people to play computer games on recycled consoles and displays  Play computer games
Breaking the extreme constraints  Refugees are constantly innovating, and before you is a Congolese named Damón-Kay.
He arrived in the refugee camp in a shallow condition, but he wanted to become a filmmaker.
So with friends and colleagues, he set up a community radio station, rented a camera, and is now making a movie.
He has already made two documentaries with our team and for our team and he started with countless resources.
It is precisely this example that should guide our response to refugees.
Instead of thinking that refugees inevitably depend on humanitarian aid, we need to give them an opportunity to achieve human prosperity.
Yes, clothing, blankets, shelter, food are all very important in an emergency, but we must also think long term.
We need to provide grid connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, finance and business channels.
All that we take for granted  pathways to the global economy  can and should be provided to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is the economic zone.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have adopted Uganda's policies.
Most host economies are not open to refugees, but we still have viable alternatives.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague-development economist Paul Koria, where we discussed an idea with the international community and local government, the idea of bringing jobs to Syrians while promoting Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea is to create an economic zone in which we can combine refugee employment with national employment in the host country Jordan.
Just 15 minutes' drive from the Zatali refugee camp, 83,000 refugees were placed here, which is an existing economic zone known as the Hussein King Development Zone.
The government has invested more than $100 million to connect the transmission grid and roads, but two things are missing: labor and foreign investment.
So what if refugees could work there instead of being trapped in a refugee camp and before returning to Syria could afford family care and develop skills through vocational training?
We recognize that doing so is beneficial for Jordan, whose national development strategy requires upgrading manufacturing as a middle-income country.
By doing so, we benefit refugees and at the same time help rebuild Syria after the war, recognizing the need to train refugees to be the best resource for rebuilding Syria.
We published this opinion in the journal Foreign Affairs.
Jordan's King Abdullah also adopted this idea.
Two weeks ago, it was announced at the London Syria Conference that the pilot project would begin implementation this summer.
The third idea I want to show is a preferential match between the country and the refugee to achieve this satisfactory outcome in this selfie.
We rarely ask refugees what they want or what they want to do, but I would argue that we can do so to the benefit of all.
Economist Ivan Roth created the concept of market pairings, i.e. the order of preferences of both parties determines the final match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Eric Tateboin researched how to apply this concept to solve refugee problems They require refugees to rank their preferred countries but at the same time allow countries to rank the refugee species they want to receive based on skill or language criteria and finally match the two rankings.
Of course, you need to establish quotas in these aspects of diversity and vulnerability, but this is a way to increase the likelihood of mating.
This concept of mating has been successfully applied, for example, mating students and universities  mating donors and patients  it also highlights the importance of algorithms in dating websites.
So why not apply it to give refugees a better choice?
This can also be applied at the national level.At this level, the biggest challenge we face is convincing local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, taking my country as an example, we often send engineers to remote areas, farmers to cities.
So the matching market provides a potential way to match these preferences and reflects the needs and demands of the people of the host country as well as refugees.
My fourth idea was a humanitarian visa.
Most of the tragedies and chaos we see in Europe are entirely avoidable.
This originates from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy: to seek asylum in Europe, you must travel to Europe on your own after a dangerous journey, but why are these trips necessary?
In an era of cheap aviation and consulates?
These were all completely unnecessary trips last year, which resulted in the deaths of more than three thousand people on the European border and within Europe.
If refugees can travel directly to Europe and seek asylum, we can avoid these deaths, which can indeed be achieved through humanitarian visas, which allow people to obtain visas at embassies or consulates in neighboring countries and then pay for them themselves by ferry or plane to reach Europe.
It would cost about a thousand euros to bring an illegal smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It only takes two hundred euros to fly from Bodrum, Turkey, to Frankfurt, Germany, on a cheap plane.
If we allow them to do so, it will bring great results.
This will save lives, eliminate illegal smuggling markets, and eliminate the chaos we see on the edge of Europe, such as the Greek islands.
The reason why we are being prevented from implementing this program is because of political rather than rational solutions.
And this is an idea that has already been applied.
Brazil was the first country to adopt this policy  More than 2,000 Syrians have been granted humanitarian visas  Enter Brazil and apply for refugee status upon entry
Under that plan, every Syrian was granted refugee status and confirmed to be a real refugee.
There is also a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports, as an entry document, allowed 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel through Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
The International Agency for Refugees (IRAF) of Nanssen has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to recognize this feasible countermeasure.
So I'm showing you four ideas on how we can add Amira options.
To allow refugees to have better choices, not limited to three basic, impossible choices, as I said before, and still benefiting everyone.
In general, we need a whole new perspective to increase the choice of refugees while also recognizing that they are not necessarily a burden to society.
zh refugees become spending is not a fixed form.
It is true that refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they also have the skills, talents and willingness to be human and contribute to society - if we allow it.
Migration will not disappear in a new world.
The landscape we see in Europe will continue to exist for many years to come.
People will continue to migrate and people will continue to flee their homes.We need to find a rational, realistic way to manage - not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid, not based on the logic of charity, but on the opportunities that globalization, markets and mobility bring.
I hope everyone recognizes this and I urge our government officials to be able to meet this challenge.
Thank you all.
When I was a kid, I dreamed of the ocean.
There are many colourful, vibrant, living animals that look like alien creatures.
I have imagined a big fish at the top of the food chain, and also imagined a beach that danced gracefully among coral reefs.
As a photographer who transitioned from marine biologist to ocean biologist, I spent most of my career looking for places that appeared in my childhood fantasies.
As you can see, I started taking risks in water at a very young age.
But the first time I really went into the water was when I was 10 years old.
I can still clearly remember, when I was digging hard to reach a trace of a splash, lying on a coral reef with a cannonball.
Finally, I managed to reach the cannon, and looking up, I found myself surrounded by a swarm of fish, fish of all colors, like a rainbow.
Since then, I have been deeply in love with the ocean.
(Subtitle: Thomas Peschak) (Subtitle: Environmental Photographer) For the past 40 years, I have had the privilege of exploring the most beautiful marine landscapes on Earth, contributing to the National Geographic Magazine and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
My camera is large enough to be a giant shark, small enough to be able to move around in your palm.
In the cold ocean of the Canadian Bear Rainforest, I met a giant star right next to me, and the smell of fish in his mouth made me forget it.
In the Mozambique Channel, I saw the ceremony of the green sea turtle's love.
Each of us will be affected by the ocean, and will be affected by it.
The pure ocean I dreamed of as a child is now increasingly difficult to find.
Their range is shrinking, and the threats to them are increasing.
We humans have always occupied the top of the food chain on Earth, and I have witnessed and recorded these behaviors with my camera.
For a long time, I thought that only shocking photos could wake up my audience.
Of course, this view is also beneficial, which is to bring me back to the beginning.
I believe the best way to bring about change is to spread love.
I feel like I am the bridge between humans and animals, and as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to unravel the mysteries of animals and ecosystems hidden in the depths of the ocean.
If you don't know anything exists, how can you love and protect it?
And this is precisely the strength of our environmental photographers.
I have visited hundreds of different seas, but only a few of them have truly made me a lifelong memorable sight.
The first time I was shocked by such a scene was almost a decade ago, on the rugged coast of South Africa.
Every year during the sixth and July months, a large number of sardines migrate north, which we call the sardine tide.
Believe me, these fish must do so.
Because there are large groups of hungry hunters who are quick to hunt behind them.
For example, dolphins who hunt collectively, they separate a portion of the sardines from the fish, and then group them together into a ball.
Dolphins would catch these sardines to a place near the surface and then rush into the big fish herd, enjoying this moving feast.
Followed by the fish.
Most people would think that sharks and dolphins are enemies, but in the shark tide, they coexist.
In fact, with the help of dolphins, the fish have eaten much fresher.
Without dolphin chasing, sardines are difficult to assemble into balls, and often pass through the midst of a herd of fish, like through a doughnut, sometimes drinking only one stomach of water.
I have had several close contacts with the shark cluster during the tides of the sardines, and I understand the shark did not take my eyes off me.
But I was still hit and beaten, and my tail was wiped, like the other guests at this noisy feast.
We sailed east from the African coastline, across the Indian Ocean, and arrived in the Maldives, an archipelago of coral reefs.
During the stormy southwestern monsoon season, the demons living in the archipelago's waters gather at the Bahá'í reef near a small island called Hanifaru.
The small, mostly smaller pupils of the group are the main food of the demons.
When these creatures are relatively scattered, the devilfish usually prey on their own, rolling backward in the water, like a dog chasing its tail.
As the floating organisms gathered more and more, the demons began to intertwine, the growing food pack shape, the taste of the demons from the head of the pack, would be devoured by the companions behind them.
As the Bay's creatures gather more and more, the form of the devilfish also increases, this unique method of prey, which we call the whirlwind prey method.
The devilfish are layered, linearly rotating in tightly packed bands, forming a formation, which absorbs the living creatures, and then sends them straight into the devilfish's huge mouth.
Diving among hundreds of demon fishes, that sight made me a lifelong memory.
When I first went to take pictures in Hanifalu, it was not yet protected, the ecological environment was threatened by local development.
By collaborating with NGOs such as the Devilfish Trust Fund, my photographs eventually helped Halifaru become a marine protected area.
Fishermen from nearby islands, who had once caught many demon fish, used their hides to make traditional drums.
Now they are the most determined protector of the devilfish, which brings the Maldives more than $8 million in annual revenue.
I've always wanted to go back in time, to that much of the map as a blank, or to mark the era of the dragon here.
The most similar places I've been to so far are some remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean.
Far from the fishing grounds and fishing boats, diving there always makes me feel sad, because it reminds me of the ocean once upon a time.
Few people have heard of the Indian Reef, a small coral reef in the Mozambique Channel.
The surrounding reefs form a protective barrier, and the atoll lake in the middle becomes the nursery for the Galapagos fish.
These sharks are never ashamed, even during the day.
I guess they'll be more active at night, and more numerous.
I've never seen so many whales in a coral reef lake before.
Record and share moments like this remind me of the original purpose of choosing this path.
Earlier this year, to complete the contract for the National Geographic magazine, I came to the California Peninsula.
In the center of the peninsula, on the Pacific side, is the St. Ignatius Atoll Lake, where important breeding grounds are found.
Over the past hundred years, this coastline has been a huge slaughterhouse, where over 20,000 ash were slaughtered, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
And now, these ashes offspring will push their young into the sea, play games, and even interact with us.
This species has come back to life in a surprising way.
On the other side of the peninsula is Cape Pulmo, a quiet fishing village.
Decades of overfishing once brought the village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the government to list the area as a marine protected area.
Everything that happened next was a miracle.
In 2005, after only 10 years of protection, scientists found that the number of local fish stocks had recovered to a record high.
Come with me, for what it's worth.
Take a deep breath, dive with me to the bottom of the sea, and see what the largest, densest fish population I have ever encountered looks like.
We all have the capacity to create hope.
I want to send a message through my own photos, and from now on, save the ocean before it's too late.
I particularly want to focus on the restorative capacity of nature, when it faces 7.3 billion humans.
I hope that in the future, I will find it increasingly difficult to take pictures like this, but rather to take more pictures that reflect people and the ocean and their interactions.
I really wish I could take pictures like this every day.
To make a name for yourself in our industry, you must be an irretrievably optimistic person.
I always carry this assumption in my photo, the next great photo that could bring about change is waiting for me right in front, maybe right behind the next reef, in the next atoll lake, or else, right next time.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
Immediately after the new government broke free from the long war of independence, it announced a socialist policy: making health care and primary education basic free programs.
Large-scale rural healthcare facilities make 80% of the population within two hours' walk of the city.
In 1980, the year Zimbabwe gained independence, 25% of children were given routine immunization.
By 1990, after just a decade, this proportion had risen to 80 percent.
I am very honored to be a part of this transformation, this revolution.
The excitement and love of homosexuality are very real.
Working side by side with the outstanding Zimbabwean people, scientists, doctors, activists, I feel I am not only involved in an African independence movement but also a progressive global public health movement.
I have also faced some terrifying difficulties.
In 1985, the year I arrived, Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS.
I had taken care of a few AIDS patients in the early 1980s, and by the time I was in medical training at Harlem Hospital, we had no idea what we would encounter in Africa.
When I first arrived there, the infection rate was about 2%.
This proportion grew rapidly when I left Harare 17 years later, with one infection per four adults.
By the mid-1990s, I had told hundreds of young people who were very excited about their HIV testing positive.
I witnessed my colleagues and friends die, and my students and hospital patients also died as a result.
Faced with this situation, I and a colleague opened a clinic.
We demonstrated how to use condoms.
We campaign in school education and the workplace.
We conducted research to provide our partners with advice on how to protect themselves.
We worked very hard to do all this, and I'm sure I had done my best by then.
I offered the best treatment possible, at least under the circumstances.
But I didn't make any constructive changes.
Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who had openly admitted that his personal fault led to the Rwandan genocide, was responsible for the genocide.
In 1994, he was the head of the UN peacekeeping mission.
At the Holocaust Decade Remembrance Ceremony, he recalled that at the time I was convinced that I had done my best, but only after the Holocaust did I realize that there was much more I could and should do - ring the alarm, seek support.
The AIDS outbreak has left the medical community unable to overcome the World Health Organization's estimates that 39 million people have died from the disease today, and many people, like me, feel regret and regret for not having been able to stop it all sooner.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't realize I was an advocate or a politician.
I thought that my medical knowledge was the reason I went there, because of my clinical and infectious disease research.
I have always felt that my job is to care for patients.I hope to slow down the spread of the virus by researching to better understand the demographics of infections.
I realized that the percentage of people living on the margins of society who are infected and dying from AIDS is surprisingly high.
In sugar plantations like these, compared to modern enterprises closer to the territory of the Feudal Empire, 60% of pregnant women tested positive for HIV.
My job is to show people that the infected are not moral degradation, but related to male-dominated consciousness, forced foreign labor and colonialism.
Most white people are safe and secure.
 As medical experts, our means are unfortunately powerless:  people change their personal behavior using condoms, reducing the number of partners.
The infection rate is rising as our most effective weapon against the virus when treatment is already available in the West for the entire African public sector, treatment is not affordable.
I did not dare to say that inequality in access to life-saving medicines or potential problems in the economic and political system were the driving force behind the low infection rate among such a large population.
I made excuses for my silence Reminding myself that I am only a visitor to this country Ringing the alarm that I may be deported Making me unable to do my job Care of my patients Do the research needed urgently
So I didn't speak out boldly about the government's early HIV policy.
I have not expressed my concerns loud enough.
Many doctors, healthcare professionals, and others may feel that I did nothing wrong.
Our commitment to patients, such as the Hippocratic Oath and its various versions, is a sacred, inviolable medical relationship.
I do my best for each of my patients.
But I know that the communicable diseases that accompany our social divide are reflected not only in biological phenomena but also in marginalization, intolerance, racial discrimination, sexism, class discrimination.
 The same is true for AIDS.
 The same is true of the recent Ebola outbreak.
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Farmer, who works on AIDS in Haiti, call it structural violence: structural because inequality is rooted in the political and economic organization of our social environment, often overlooked as privileged and regulated; violence because of its effects, such as premature death, suffering, illness, is violent.
We do little for our patients if we are not aware of these social injustices.
The sounding of the alarm is the first step in the right direction, leading public health care, and this is how we seek support, how we work together to invade, and create a way to truly change the world.
So now, I'm not keeping quiet.
I have the audacity to speak up about many things, even though it makes my listener uncomfortable.
Many of these, many of them about apartheid and organized racism, are things that shouldn't happen in this country, shouldn't exist in medical practice or in public health.
But they do exist, and we pay the price of shortening our lives for that.
This is why the alarm is sounding in the United States against racism  Health care  Continuous organized, interpersonal violence against people of color  Related to our tragic history 250 years of slavery 90 years of racial discrimination 60 years of imperfect equality  The alarm is the focus of my work as New York City Health Commissioner
In New York City, the rate of premature death, that is, death before age 65, is 50% higher for blacks than for whites.
In 2012, black women faced a 10 times greater risk of reproductive death than white women.
Despite the fact that we have made great strides in reducing infant mortality, the first-year mortality rate for black babies is still nearly three times that of white babies.
New York City is no exception.
These statistics are similar across the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are about one and a half million missing black men nationwide.
The author notes that at least one in six black men aged 25 to 54 disappears from daily life, or from prison, or premature death.
Young black people face disproportionate violence every day, which is extremely unfair, and all of this is evident in the recent protests against the slogan "Black Lives Matter".
But we need to remember the current state and outcome of ordinary medicine, as well as the persistent and high incidence of disease, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, those diseases that slowly quietly engulf lives, allow more black people to live with diseases that die prematurely.
As the movement for the meaning of life in the black community began, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community was hesitant to use the word racism in research and work, even in the face of the threat of racism.
Every time I say it, you probably already feel it.
Medical students dressed in white robes protested against the death of biological weapons, but medical groups face the continuing racial discrimination that affects the disease status and mortality rate largely by default.
I am concerned that the search for biological and genetic targets with better design therapies may inadvertently make us unable to focus on the bigger picture, and this is the scene of everyday life where one's life, growth, work, love is significantly affected by group health for many of us, ill health.
In everyday life, as healthcare workers, whether in clinics or in research, we are all witnesses of enormous injustices: a vagrant, unable to comply with medical orders, because he must prioritize more urgent matters; a young transgender, planning suicide, because our society is too ruthless; a single mother, forced to feel the need to take responsibility for her child's poor health.
As healthcare workers, our role is not only to treat our patients, but to sound the alarm and advocate for change.
And whether our social standing is justifiable or not, it makes our voice more credible and we shouldn't waste it.
I regret not being able to speak openly in Zimbabwe. I have already committed to myself. As New York City's health commissioner, I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and seek support for health equity.
I will speak out against racial discrimination and I hope you can join me and I will join you when you speak out against gender discrimination or any other form of inequality.
It is time for us to stand up and fight together against structural inequality.
To advocate for change, we don't need to have all the answers.
All we need is courage.
The health of our patients, our own health, depends entirely on it.
Well, I want to ask you to raise your hand, how many people have ever hacked a friend on Facebook because they made inappropriate comments about politics, religion, children's rights, or food?
How many people have at least one person they don't want to see because you don't want to talk to them?
Remember, in the past, if we wanted a polite conversation, we should only follow the advice of Henry Higgins in his book, The Weather and Your Health: Talk about the weather and your health.
But in recent years, with climate change and the anti-vaccine movement, this has become less effective.
Therefore, in this world in which we live, this world where every conversation has the potential to turn into a world of arguments, politicians unable to talk to each other, even those things that are outragedly supported or opposed by the masses, this is not normal.
The Pew Research Center conducted a survey of 10,000 American adults, and found that our current bias, our position, and our position are more pronounced than at any other time in history.
We are less likely to compromise, which means we are not listening to each other.
All the decisions we make, including where we live, who we marry or even who we make friends with, are based solely on our preconceived beliefs.
Again and again, this shows that we have not listened to each other.
Talking needs to balance speaking and listening, and somehow, we gradually lose that balance.
Technological advances are partly the reason.
For example, a smartphone, which is now in your hands, or next to it, can be taken with your hands.
According to Pew Research Center, about one-third of American teens send more than a hundred text messages a day.
And many of those in the middle, almost all of them, prefer texting to friends rather than talking face-to-face.
The Atlantic Monthly published a great article,
The author is Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
He gave his students a task of exchange,
I hope to teach them how not to use notes to give speeches on a particular topic.
Then he said: I started to realize......
I began to realize that communication skills are perhaps the most overlooked skills that we have, and that no one can teach them well.
Children spend hours each day on screen with other partners, but rarely have the opportunity to explore their own interpersonal skills.
This sounds ridiculous, but we must ask ourselves: What skills in the 21st century will be more important than maintaining a coherent, confident conversation?
Now, my job is to talk to others.... Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, governors, plumbers.
I talk to people I like, and I talk to people I don't like.
I talk to people who personally disagree with me.
But I still have good communication with them.
So I hope to spend the next 10 minutes teaching you how to talk, and how to listen.
Many of you have heard countless suggestions, such as looking into each other's eyes, thinking ahead of time about interesting topics to discuss, paying attention, nodding and smiling to show your focus, repeating what you just heard, or making a summary.
I want you to forget all this,
Not all of them were useful.
There's no need to learn how to show your focus, if you're really focused.
I'm actually applying the same techniques as a career interviewer in everyday life.
Well, I'm here to teach you how to interview others, and this will actually help you learn how to become a better communicator.
Learn to start a conversation, not waste time, not feel bored, and, most importantly, not offend anyone.
We've all had some great conversations.
We've all been there. We know how that feels.
After that kind of ending, you feel like you enjoyed it, were inspired to have a conversation, or felt like you really connected with someone else, or that you were completely understood by the other person.
There is no reason to say that most of your interpersonal interactions cannot be that way.
I have ten basic rules. I'll explain one to you, but honestly, if you choose one and master it well, you can enjoy a more enjoyable conversation.
First, do not give up your thoughts.
I'm not saying just put down your phone, tablet, car key, or whatever else you want in your hand.
I mean, in the present moment.
zh enter that situation and go into it.
Don't think about the fight with your boss before you do.
Don't worry about what you're having for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation. But don't be in Cao Cao'anzheng.
Article Two: Don't be a good teacher.
If you want to express your opinion, and not want to miss any opportunity to get people to comment, argue, refute or comment, blog.
There is a good reason to explain why I don't allow experts to speak in my conversation: Because it's really boring.
If the other is a conservative, then he must hate Obama, food stamps and abortion.
If the other is a liberal, then he will surely hate big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
zh is entirely predictable.
You certainly don't want that to happen.
You need to assume that you can learn something every time you enter into an exchange.
As the famous therapist M. Scott Pike has said, true listening requires putting oneself aside.
Sometimes, this means putting your personal point of view aside.
He said that those who feel this acceptance, talk, and feel will become more vulnerable and sensitive, and therefore more likely to open up their inner world, presenting it to the listener.
Again, let's say you need to learn something new.
Bill Nye says: "Every person you're going to meet has something you don't know about.
Let me reiterate: Everyone is an expert in some field.
Third point: use an open question.
 In this regard, please refer to the way in which journalists are interviewed.
Start asking questions about who, what, when, where, why, or how.
If you ask a complex question, you will get a simple answer.
If I asked you: Were you afraid then?
You will answer the strongest word in that sentence, 即恐, and the answer will be  yeszh or  no.
Were you angry at the time? Yes, I was very angry at the time.
Let the other person describe, the other person is the one who understands the situation.
 Try asking the other person:  What is that like?
How do you feel?
Because in such a situation, the other person may need to pause and think about it, and you will get a more interesting answer.
Fourth point: follow nature.
That is, thoughts flow naturally into your mind, and you need to express them.
We often hear guests speak for a few minutes during interviews, and then the host comes back to ask a question, which is as if we don't know where it came from or has already been answered.
This suggests that the presenter may not have been listening two minutes ago, because he thought of this very clever question, so he thought of asking the question in his mind and mind.
We will do the same.
As we sat down and talked to someone, we suddenly remembered that chance meeting with Hugh Jackman at a coffee shop.
Then we no longer listen to them.
Stories and ideas will always flow to you,
But even if you can't stop it, don't let it stay in your mind too long.
Fifth point: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People on radio shows, especially on national public radio stations, are very aware that their conversations will be broadcasted outdoors. So they will be more careful about where they claim to be professional and what they say.
You have to learn to do this.
Talking should be a responsible course of action.
Article 6: Don't compare your own experience with others.
If your partner is talking about losing a family member, don't start talking about losing a family member.
If someone else is bothering you at work, don't tell them how much you hate your job.
It's different, it's never the same.
Any experience is unique.
And, more importantly, it's not about you being talked about.
You don't have to prove right now how much you can do, or how much pain you have endured.
When someone asked Stephen Hawking how much his IQ was, he replied: "I don't know.
Talking is not about promoting your own.
Article 7: Try not to repeat your words as often as possible.
It's both aggressive and boring, but we're easy to do that.
Especially during a work conversation, or when talking to a child.We want to state a point of view, so we keep saying it in a different way.
Don't be like that.
The eighth article: Stop talking nonsense.
To be honest, nobody cares about the years, names, dates, etc. You try hard to remember the details in your mind.
And no one cares, they only care about you.
The other person is concerned about who you are, and what you have in common with them.
So forget the details and don't worry about them.
Article 9: This is not the last sentence, but the most important one.
zh listen carefully.
I cannot say how many important people have said that listening is probably the most important, the first important skill you can improve.
The Buddha said, "I translate it, if you keep your mouth shut, you will not learn anything".
Calvin Coolidge once said: "No one has ever been fired for overhearing".
Why do we not want to listen to each other?
First of all, we prefer to say zh.
As I speak, everything is under my control.
I don't need to listen to anything I'm not interested in.
I am the focus.
I can strengthen my sense of identity.
But there is another reason: We will be disturbed.
On average, people say about 225 words per minute, but we can hear almost 500 words per minute.
So our brains are now occupied by these 275 additional words.
I know it takes a lot of energy to really pay attention to what others are saying, but if you don't, you're not talking.
You are just two people in the same place and unrelated to each other.
You must listen to each other.
Stephen Kovey has a wonderful account of this.
He said: "Most of us don't listen to people to understand.
We listen to the response.
The last one, Article 10: Briefly
Good conversation is like a miniature of goodness; short enough, attractive enough, long enough to cover the subject, my sister's metaphor, all of which are summed up in the same concept: generating interest in others.
I grew up with a famous cousin, who was always a guest in my home.
Visitors would come and talk to my ex-grandparents, and after they left, my mother would come and ask us: "Do you know who that is?
She was the runner-up of Miss America.
He is the mayor of Sacramento.
She won the Pulitzer Prize.He is a Russian ballet dancer.
I grew up accepting that everyone has the unknown.
To be honest, I think it's all of this that made me a better host.
I try to speak as little as possible, but open my mind, always ready for surprise, and never disappointed.
You can do the same.
Go out, talk to others, listen to others, and most importantly, be ready for a big surprise.
Thank you very much.
Welcome to the world.
My name is Matthew Williams and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports and at the Canadian Open, participated in international basketball programs, and am very proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I spend five days a week with top coaches and psychological work advisors training basketball and speed skating to maintain the best competitive status.
Additionally, all of this is due to the Special Olympics Games.
Has this changed your view of me and my accomplishments?
This world doesn't consider all people like me champions.
Not long ago, people like me were unprecedented.
Since the Special Olympics began in 1968, this phenomenon has improved significantly, but in reality it is still often seen in comparison to ordinary people.
People used the word "zh" in front of me, thinking I would be useless.
They call me 子zh, saying I am late is a perfectly legitimate use of the term.
They don't know how much this hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I came here to get mercy.
I am here because the question still exists: there are still many people who have problems with the way they view people with intellectual disabilities, or, more often, many people simply do not recognize their existence.
You all know that the World Games will be held this year, right?
I was one of 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries competing in Los Angeles.
More than 62,000 people attended the opening ceremony, and TSN and ESPN also broadcast live.
But did you know about this?
When you see someone like me, what do you think?
I came here today to boldly put forward a statement that we are treated as equals.
The Special Olympics changed the self-awareness of athletes with intellectual disabilities and also changed the perception of the audience.
If you are not familiar with the Special Olympics, let me explain, it is designed for people with intellectual disabilities.
It is independent of the Paralympic Games and the Olympic Games.
We have high-quality, year-round sports programs for athletes with intellectual disabilities that can change our destiny and our perception of ourselves.
The Special Olympics changed my life and many others' lives, while changing the way people see the world about people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with ADHD and intellectual disabilities.
Until I was 12, I was playing hockey.
The older I get, the harder it gets to keep up with people, the more frustrated I get.
For a while, I didn't play any sports  I didn't have many friends  I felt abandoned, nobody asked 
People who have been mentally handicapped for so long have been isolated from society, not exposed.
No one would feel that they could participate in sports, let alone be a valuable part of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of normal movement on the health of children with intellectual disabilities.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers have reached a conclusion through rigorous scientific research: The reason for the decline in health in children with intellectual disabilities is simply the lack of exercise opportunities.
Many people who question the ability of people with intellectual disabilities to benefit from sports programs or athletic competitions.
But it is because of Dr. Hayden, and Eunice Kennedy Sheriff, founder of the Special Olympics, that they insist on the benefits of sport, and special Olympics athletes have proven the benefits of sport at least 4.5 million times.
Before I took part in the Special Olympics, I was a nervous person because I was shy, insecure, and had few friends.
But when I got there, I found everyone was friendly, willing to help, not discriminating against me, and let me do it myself.
Now, I'm a basketball player, a speed skater, and a competitor at the provincial and national level, and this year I'm also a Special Olympics Special Olympics Specialist at Los Angeles, where I represent the first Canadian basketball player to compete in a World Championship.
I'm one of the 4.5 million athletes in the world, and I've heard many similar stories.
 Becoming an athlete at the Special Olympics helps us regain our self-confidence and dignity.
This sporting event also highlighted important health needs.
Studies show that on average, men with intellectual disabilities live 13 years less than men without intellectual disabilities, and women with intellectual disabilities live 20 years less than women without intellectual disabilities.
Special Olympics keep us healthy and actively engage in sports.
Our coach also teaches us about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics also provide free health care to athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctors or who have difficulty receiving health care.
At the 2015 Summer Special Olympics, my Canadian teammates and I competed against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the match, the Nigerian basketball team participated in the health system physical examination of the Games, 7 out of 10 team members were given free hearing aids for the first time in life.
The change that has brought them is amazing.
They are more excited, happy, confident because their coach is finally able to communicate with them in language.
They are very easily excited because they can hear the sound of basketball, whistle-blowing, and cheering of fans standing next to them - the sounds we think there should be.
The Special Olympics Games not only changed athletes' athletic performance, but also changed their attitudes.
It also changes the way athletes live at the same time.
This year, a study showed that in the United States, nearly half of adults with intellectual disabilities don't even know about one person, and 44% of Americans who have no contact with someone with intellectual disabilities have a markedly more intolerant, less positive attitude.
Then the word with the word   proved that people with intellectual disabilities are still ignored  feel isolated and isolated.
People use this word either by word of mouth or by insult.
Last year on Twitter, it was used more than nine million times, and it hurt me deeply and the 4.5 million athletes around the world.
People don't think this is a curse, but it is.
My fellow athlete and global envoy, Franklin Stephens, wrote a letter to a political critic who had used slurs to scold him.
See if you're still thinking about it when you leave.
This year, at the 2015 Summer Special Olympics, people lined up for hours to watch the last night of weightlifting.
When my teammate Jackie Barrett came out, everyone stood up. He was known as the Newfoundland Camel. He pulled up 665 pounds and lifted 611 pounds, setting several new records for the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder in the Newfoundland weightlifting event, not just for the Special Olympics, but for all weightlifting events.
Jackie is now a big star in Los Angeles, and ESPN tweeted in real time about him breaking a record and being shocked by his performance.
Fifty years ago, hardly anyone could imagine an intellectually disabled person doing this.
This year, 60,000 people filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Stadium, watched the opening ceremony of the tournament, and congratulated athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We are cheered and cheered, not hidden anymore.
Special Olympics church athletes are more confident, more self-confident, and more proud.
The Special Olympics also teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve to be included in the special Olympics.
Now, in my sports career, I have dreams and accomplishments, good training, respect, and a healthier life.
I'm not being hidden, bullied, I'm doing a TED Talk here at TEDzh.
With the Special Olympics, the world has changed, but there is still a long way to go.
So next time you see people with intellectual disabilities, I hope you see their potential.
Next time someone around you uses the word "shame" I hope you tell them that it's a very hurtful word.
I hope you'll want to see a special Olympics.
Finally, I share with you an idea.
Nelson Mandela has said that sports have the potential to change the world.
The Special Olympics are changing the world by changing 4.5 million athletes, giving us a place, making us confident, knowing friends, not being discriminated against, and being able to experience as champions as a team.
Thank you all!
You may not have heard of Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Aru'a in Nigeria.
But I think they are the two best places in the world.
There is a hospital there, a community of nurses, surgeons and scientists, that has been silently fighting for years against one of the deadliest threats to humanity: the Lhasa virus.
The Lhasa virus is very similar to Ebola virus.
It can cause severe fever symptoms, and is often fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day to protect each member of the community, while also protecting us all.
The best thing I learned from them was that when I first visited them many years ago, during those challenging days of fighting on the front lines, they started singing the song like this every morning.
They gathered together, and did their best to show their joy.
They exhibit a spirit.
Many years passed, and when we visited each other year after year, I could sing along with them, and we would record them, and we loved doing so, because it reminded us that we are not only exploring scientific truth together, but also that there is a human bond that binds us together.
And you can imagine, as the world changes, this connection becomes extremely important, even indispensable.
In March 2014, a major outbreak occurred.Ebola outbreak broke out in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, occurring at the border of Sierra Leone and Libya.
The situation was so appalling, we were all shocked.
In fact, we even once doubted the extent of the spread of the Lhasa and Ebola outbreaks than we imagined, and we feared that one day it would spread to Kenya.
So my team members immediately set out, rushed there and joined Dr. Khmer Khan and his team, we built up diagnostic equipment, to perform some sensitive molecular testing, and when Ebola virus crosses the Sierra Leone border, we can detect it.
We have already set up such a large-scale device for the Laszlo virus, we know how to deal with it, and this team is extremely excellent.
We just need to give them equipment and a place, let them study Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman entered the hospital's maternity ward, and our team performed the important molecular tests and confirmed the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This is actually very amazing.
They can diagnose the disease early, safely treat the patient, and begin to track the contact, tracking the spread of the disease.
It could have prevented something.
But by the time that day came, the outbreak had already begun several months earlier.
After detecting hundreds of cases, it compared all previous outbreaks.
And the virus did not come from that single case of the virus that invaded Sierra Leone, it was a huge shock wave.
We must work closely with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, with the local Kenema community, to deal with these cases.  The next week 31 patients arrived, then 92 patients, then 147 patients, all flocked to Kenema, as this is one of the few places in Sierra Leone that can cope with the epidemic. 
We work tirelessly, working hard, hoping to help every patient, hoping to get everyone's attention, but we also did another simple thing.
To detect Ebola, we took samples from patients' blood, which we could of course throw away directly.
But in fact, there is another thing we can do, which is to deactivate the sample with the addition of chemicals, then pack it in a box, transport it across the ocean, and that is exactly what we did.
We sent the samples to Boston, where my team works,
We also work day and night, working shifts every day, so we quickly sorted out 99 Ebola genomes.
This is a blueprint of the genome of the virus zh h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h
We also have human bodies.
It details everything that makes up our bodies, telling us a lot of information.
The results of these works are simple, but also powerful.
We can take these 99 different virus variants, observe and compare them, we can clearly see, compared to the three genomes released in Guinea, we can find that the disease has already begun to spread in Guinea a few months ago, once it has entered the population, it is transmitted rapidly through human-to-human contact.
This information is indeed vital, especially when you are investigating how to prevent the spread of the virus.
We can also see that when the virus is transmitted from person to person, it is also changing.
Each variant is of immense importance, because all diagnoses, vaccines, and treatments we use are basically based on that particular genome sequence, which is the root cause of the spread of the outbreak.
Therefore, global health experts need to respond quickly, improve research methods, and adjust everything they do.
But from where I was at the time, the scientific method of research was that I got the data, I might have to spend months in the lab researching, carefully analyzing the data, writing a good paper, throwing it out, then revising it repeatedly, and finally the paper was public, so that the data could be made public.
This was the state of scientific research at the time.
Well, at that particular time, this method is definitely not useful, right?
Some of our friends are on the front lines of the fight against disease, and obviously the most important thing for us is outside help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did, the result of genetic sequencing came out of the machine, and we immediately posted the data online.
We open up to the world, and then say, "Help us!"
So help me to get to the next level.
We haven't responded yet, and a large group of people around the world are actively contacting us, and they are surprised to see this data made public online.
Some of the world's greatest virus trackers have suddenly become part of our team!
We collaborate in this virtual way, we share information, we frequently make calls, we always stay in touch, hoping to track the spread of the virus in seconds, and then find a way to control it.
In fact, if we are to organize such a group, there are many ways to do so.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic erupted around the world, is constantly getting information, participating, and getting involved.
Everyone wants to make a contribution.
The power of everyone in the world is truly magical, and the Internet connects us.
Can you imagine, we are no longer afraid to communicate with others, we all say, "Get a job".
Let us work together, we can do it!zh
But the problem is, the data we all use, the data we search on Google, is far from meeting the demands of our work.
When this happens, we miss out on many opportunities.
So at the beginning of the Kenema outbreak, we had 106 patients with a clinical record, and once again we made these statements public.
In our own lab, you give us the 106 records, and we can let the computer predict the next Ebola patient, and with accuracy close to 100%.
We also created an app, which specifically publishes these predictions, so that healthcare professionals around the world have access to this information.
But 106 reports are far from sufficient, and cannot be used effectively.
So we're waiting for more clinical reports, before releasing that software,
And these reports have not always come.
We are still waiting, we are still constantly updating the software, and we are working in the lab instead of working with you.
This is true... we cannot accept it at all.
You, all of you, can't accept it.
Now is the time for life to be on the line.
However, in reality, many people have sacrificed, many people work in the medical field, including my dear colleagues, there are five colleagues: Mbaruni, Alex Mubi, Dr. Khumar Khan, Alice Kovarma, and Mohammed Fuller.
These are just five of the ten million healthcare workers who have sacrificed in Kenema and elsewhere, while the world has been waiting, we have been burying, people are independent, without communication.
Ebola, like other threats to humanity, is increasingly being threatened by the lack of trust, dispersal and isolation between people.
As we build barriers and fight each other, the flame of the virus is even more intense.
But Ebola is not like any other threat, because this time, we became a family.
We are all on the same front lines.
Someone has Ebola, and we might be next.
So we live in a world where we share common weaknesses, common strengths, common fears, common hopes, and I sincerely hope we can work together with joy.
One of my graduate students read a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered the word Keneima, the name of that city, the name of that hospital, when we worked in Sierra Leone, which in Mandarin means transparent, clear as a river, and all eyes can touch.
This has a very profound meaning for us, we ourselves do not realize it, but we have always felt that in order to pay homage to Kenema, all those we have fought for, we must be open to cooperation, we must share information, we must work together to co-operate.
We must do this.
This is what everyone should ask of themselves and others.When disasters strike, we should all open our hearts to one another, and fight this battle together.
Since this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, nor will it be the last, many other microbes have been lurking around us, just like the Lhasa virus and other organisms.
The next time a disaster strikes, it may be in a city with a population of one million, or it may explode there.
The virus may be transmitted through air.
Viruses may even be deliberately spread by humans.
I know it's scary, I can understand it, but I also know that this experience tells us that we have enough technology and capabilities to win this battle, not only to win this battle, but to fight all viruses.
But we can only do this when we work with sincerity, and we want to be happy.
So to Dr Khan, and to all those who have sacrificed themselves on the front lines of fighting disease, who have always fought alongside us, let us fight alongside them forever.
Our world should not be defined by the destruction caused by a single virus, but by the unity of billions of minds and hearts in the working light of the earth.
Thank you all.
