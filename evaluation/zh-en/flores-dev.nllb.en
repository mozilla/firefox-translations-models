The glass is knocked with a chair, but the windows are indestructible.
Frenchman Kowal, a survivor, said: "Finally a piece of glass broke, and they started to run out the window".
Stars will emit light and heat, which is because when the zh atoms combine together to form heavier elements, they produce energy.
Scientists are currently working on building a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a difficult problem to solve. It will take many years before we see a practical fusion reactor built.
Due to the surface tension, the steel needle can float on the water surface.
The reason for the surface tension is the strong attraction between water molecules on the surface of the water, which is much stronger than the attraction between water molecules and air molecules above.
Water molecules form an invisible outer layer on the surface of water, which allows something like a needle to float on the surface of the water.
The blade of modern skating shoes is double-edged, with a hole between the blade and the blade.
Because of the slight curvature of the blade's base, when the blade is bent to one side, the edge of the blade that comes into contact with ice is curved.
In this way, the skater can turn around. The ice knife slopes to the right, the skater to the right. The ice knife slopes to the left, the skater to the left.
They must eliminate the excess energy from light to restore it to its previous energy level.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called the photonzh.
Scientists call this process "hyper-radiation" because atoms are excited by strong light, causing the emission of photons, while light is also a form of radiation.
The following image shows the state of the photon-emitting atomic system.Of course, the photon is actually much smaller than the image.
Photons are even smaller than the matter that makes up atoms!
After several hundred hours of use, the filament was finally burned, and the light bulb was no longer lit.
Then you need to replace the bulb.You must be careful when changing the bulb.
First, you must turn off the switch or cut off the cable connection to the lighting fixtures.
This is because, when a bulb is still connected to the plug, when you touch the plug inside or the metal base of the bulb, electricity flows into the plug, causing you to be severely electrocuted.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which is responsible for blood circulation.
Blood flows from the heart through a tube called the arteries, and then back into the heart through a tube called the veins.The smallest tube is called the capillaries.
The teeth of the Dragon Dragon can not only bite the leaves, but also the very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that the dragon feeds on cuttlefish, which was a common plant in the Late Bronze Age.
These plants look like a small palm tree, the crown of which is made up of nail-shaped leaves.
Before eating the stems, the triangular dragon uses its powerful mouth to remove the leaves.
Other scientists consider these plants to be toxic, so it is unlikely that dinosaurs will eat them, even if now other animals such as the descendants of dinosaurs can eat the toxic leaves or fruit.
If you were standing on the surface of Jupiter, your weight would be lighter than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds on Earth, but weighing about 36 pounds on Jupiter, is 16 pounds.
The sun is not as flat as the earth, which can stand above it.The entire sun is made up of gas, fire and plasma.
The further you are from the center of the sun, the thinner the gas.
The outer layer of the sun we see is called the light sphere, meaning the light sphere.
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe the sky and discovered that Venus had a phase consistent with the moon.
The change occurs because Venus (or the moon) is only illuminated on one side of the sun.The change in Venus supports the theory of Copernicus that planets orbit the sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a single Venus sun.
After the reconquest of the Danish legal region (Danelaw), England enjoyed a long period of peace.

There are many theories about the origin of the language, including that the Arian people migrated from the West to India, bringing their own language here.
The 语 is an ancient language, comparable to the Latin of Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in the Chinese language.When the Chinese language was completed, the language gradually disappeared due to the system of hierarchy.
 is a highly refined language and the origin of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the end of the war against France, Germany began to prepare for the invasion of the British Isles.
Germany dubbed this attack Operation Sea Lion. British troops lost most of their heavy weapons and supplies when they retreated from Dunkirk.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy, capable of destroying any invading fleet across the English Channel.
However, few Royal Navy ships are stationed near a potential invasion route, as naval commanders fear they will be sunk by German airstrikes.
Let us first explain the Italian plan.Italy is basically a German and Japanese little brother.
The country's army and navy are both weaker, although they built four new ships shortly before the war began.
Italy's main objective is to conquer African countries, and to capture them, they need an army base so that the army can cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To this end, they had to withdraw British bases and ships from Egypt.Besides taking these actions, Italian warships should not have taken any action.
Now let's look at Japan.Like the UK, Japan is an island nation.
Submarines are ships designed to navigate underwater, and submarines stay underwater for longer periods of time.
U-boats were used during both World War I and World War II. At the time, they were slow and had very limited range.
At the outbreak of war, they mostly sailed over the sea, but as radar technology developed and accuracy improved, submarines were forced to dive underwater to avoid detection.
German submarines are known as Uzh-type submarines. Germans are very good at navigating and operating submarines.
Because the Germans were so successful at submarine-building, they were not able to handle large numbers of submarines after the war.
King Tutankhamun, sometimes also called the Tutankhamun King or the Young King, was one of the most famous modern kings of ancient Egypt.
Interestingly, he was not considered a man of great importance in ancient times, nor was he recorded in most ancient lists of kings.
However, in 1922 his tomb was discovered, which made him famous. Although many of the tombs in the past were stolen, this tomb was almost intact.
Most of Tutankhamun's burial goods are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare gemstones.
The invention of the radiator made the Assyrian chariot lighter, faster, and more easily transported than soldiers and other chariots.
They fired arrows from deadly crossbows, armour that could penetrate enemy forces.After 1000 years before B.C., the Assyrians used the first cavalry units.
The cavalry was an army that fought on horseback.At the time, the horse had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry could only fight on the bright horseback.
We know of many Greek politicians, scientists and artists.The most famous people in Greek culture may have been the legendary colored blind poet Homer.He wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes remained popular playwrights, and their plays are considered among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek was the mathematician Pythagoras, whose most famous achievement was to propose the famous theorem about the angular relations of right triangles.
There are different definitions of the number of people who speak Hindi. According to estimates, Hindi is the second to fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers depends on whether the closely related dialects are included.
It is estimated that the number of people who speak such a language ranges from 3.4 to 500 million, while the number of people who understand such a language reaches up to 800 million.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary, but different spelling; in everyday conversation, the two languages can often communicate with each other.
After the 15th century, northern Estonia was heavily influenced by German culture.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to their people, so they invented the Estonian script.
It adds a letter zhÕ/õ to the German alphabet.
Over time, many foreign words in German merged with the original vocabulary. This was the beginning of the Enlightenment movement.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne would be directly enlisted after completing his education.

Learning how to create interactive media requires conventional traditional skills, as well as the tools mastered in interactive courses (story board production, audio and video editing, storytelling design, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to reevaluate assumptions about media production, and learn nonlinear thinking.
Interactive design requires that the various components of a project are interconnected, but can also exist as a separate entity.
The disadvantage of a focus-shifting lens is that, to achieve a certain focus range, the required focus complexity and number of lens elements is far greater than a focusing lens.
As lens manufacturers reach higher standards in lens production, this is no longer a problem.
This allows the focus-shifted lens to take pictures that are similar to the quality of the fixed-focus lens.
Another disadvantage of a focus-shifting lens is that the lens's maximum aperture (speed) is usually smaller.
This makes cheap focus-shifting lenses difficult to use in low light conditions without flashlights.
When trying to convert a movie to DVD format, one of the most common problems is over-scanning.
Most TV shows are produced for the general public.
For this reason, the edges of the screen you see on TV, including the top, bottom and sides, have all been cut.
This is done to ensure that the image can cover the entire screen.This is called over-scanning.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its borderline is likely to be cut off, and if the video's subtitle is too close to the bottom, the subtitle will also be incomplete.
This traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination of people, bringing to mind the images of the horseshoe-like lance, feast and the spirit of King Arthur's knighthood.
Even in the ruins of a thousand years, people can easily recall the sounds and smells of wars that have long since passed away, can almost hear the sound of horses crashing into rocks, and can smell the breath of fear that sprang from the pit of the underground.
But is our imagination based on reality? why castles were built in the first place? how were they designed and built?
As a typical architecture of the period, instead of being a real castle, the Castle of Muxloe is a fortified house.
Its large glass windows and thin walls could not withstand a single decisive attack for long periods of time.
In the 1880s, when Lord Hastings began building the castle, the country was still relatively peaceful, only to defend a small group of roaming looters.
The balance of power is a system in which European countries seek to maintain the sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea is that all European countries must try to prevent a country/region from becoming stronger on its own, and therefore, governments often change allies to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession marked the first war to center on the question of balance of power.
This marks an important change, as the great powers of Europe will no longer be able to use religious warfare as an excuse.
On July 21, 356 B.C., the act of Herostratus's burning of the fire led to the destruction of the goddess Alchimys in Ephesus.
According to the plot, this man is willing to take the lead at any cost. Angry Ephesians declared the name of Black Rostatus (Herostratus) as a book.
The Greek historian Strabozh later mentioned this name, which is the name we know today.The temple was destroyed on the night of Alexander the Great's birth.
Alexander the Great originally proposed rebuilding the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Subsequently, after Alexander's death, the temple was reconstructed in 323 BC.

Sikhism is a religion that originated in the Indian subcontinent.It originated in the 15th century in Punjab, an internal sectarian split from Hindu traditions.
Sikhs believe that they believe in a religion different from Hinduism, although they acknowledge that Sikhism originated in Hinduism, it also contains Hindu traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means the Way of the Guru, a fundamental part of all Indian religions, but it has a particularly high status among Sikhs, becoming the core of Sikh belief.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539), followed by nine other gurus.
However, in June 1956, when the riots of Polish workers protesting food shortages and wage cuts turned into protests against the communist system itself, Khrushchev's commitment was put to the test.

The Indian River Valley civilization is a Bronze Age civilization, located in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, covering most of modern-day Pakistan, as well as parts of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The civilization of the Indian River basin flourished, hence the name.
Although some scholars have speculated that, given that this civilization also exists in the now-arid Saraswati basin, it is only fair to call it the Indian-Saraswati civilization, but some have called it the Harappa civilization, which was named after the first site of the Harappa excavation in the region in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the advancement and development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors, and even organized the first Roman medical team, for postwar medical use.
Surgeons are familiar with a variety of sedatives, including morphine extracted from the seeds of zh and ester extracted from the seeds of.
In addition to using blood thinners and arteries to block blood flow, they have been skilled at rescuing patients through amputation.
In the course of several centuries, the Roman Empire achieved tremendous results in the field of medicine, constituting much of the knowledge we know today.
The rules of the pure earth folding, which limit folding to one time only, do not allow more complex movements such as reverse folding, and all folding positions must be simple and clear.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people who were paper folders with little experience or with poor hand skills.
From a young age, children are aware of racial and racial stereotypes, which affect their behavior.
For example, if people modeled a child of a minority ethnicity as performing poorly at school, then once these children learned the modeling concept of their own ethnicity, they often performed poorly at school.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States, with 54 million registered accounts.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites also have advantages, such as the ability to easily create a classroom page containing blog, video, photo, and other content.
Providing an internet address is the easiest way to access the page.This makes it easier to remember, easier to enter, and easier for students who don't have difficulty with keyboards or spelling.
It can be customized to be read, or it can use more or less color depending on the needs.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a neurological disorder characterized by three distinct symptoms: impulse, attention deficit, and over-energy.
It's not a lack of learning ability, but a learning disability; it affects 3 to 5% of all U.S. children, and the population may be as high as 2 million.
Children with ADHD have difficulty concentrating on tasks, such as homework, but they can concentrate on doing things they like to do, such as playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without a scorecard.
These children often get into a lot of trouble because normal methods do not stimulate their brains, and in order to stimulate their brains, they commit dangerous behavior, fight, challenge authority.
Attention-deficit disorder (ADD) affects the relationship between children with ADHD and their peers, because other children cannot understand why patients behave, spell out, or understand why their maturity levels differ from each other.
When the ability to acquire knowledge and learn changes as described above, the basic rate of acquiring knowledge also changes accordingly.
The way to get information is different. Stress no longer exists in personal memory, but the ability to remember text is becoming more important.
The Renaissance radically changed the way learning and knowledge spread.
What distinguished primitive humans from other primates was that they no longer moved their bodies with their hands, carried heavy objects, and wandered through the woods.
The size and length of the chimpanzee's palms are similar, reflecting the fact that the hands are used to carry weight in their backs.
Human hands are shorter than feet, meaning that the bones are straight.
Fossils of the bones of the hands, dating back two to three million years, have undergone changes in their functioning, from the movement of the hands to the operation of the hands.
Some people think that frequent artificial induction, or lucid dreaming, can make one exhausted.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that lucid dreams prolong the time interval between fast-moving eyes.
The shorter the period of rapid eye movement (REM) each night, the less often the body is able to recover its mood and sleep well in this state, the more likely it is that the body will have problems.
It's as exhausting as waking up every two and a half minutes watching TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain has nightly nightmares.
The situation for Italians in North Africa was almost from the beginning not ideal.On June 10, 1940, less than a week after Italy declared war, the British 11th Cavalry captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In a raid on the east of Bastia, the British captured General Ratouzzi, the commander of the Italian 10th Army of Engineers.
On June 28, the successor of the Libyan governor, Marshal Italo Balbo, was shot dead by friendly forces while landing in Tobruk.
Modern fencing is divided into several levels: there is a level of initial learning for university students, there is also a level of professional and Olympic athletics.
The sport is mainly a form of confrontation, i.e. a duel between one fighter and another fighter.
Golf is a sport in which a player uses a club to hit a ball into a hole.
In a regular round of matches, players usually start from the first hole of the pitch, and end at the eighteenth hole.
The player who finishes the game with the fewest hits or batting average wins.
The competition was held on grass, the grass around the hole being cut shorter, called fruit.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism, and what most people think of when they think of tourism: leisure tourism.
This refers to people going to a place that is completely different from their daily lives to relax and have fun.
The theme parks and campgrounds are usually the most frequented places for leisure tourists.
If a person visits a particular place for the purpose of learning about its history and culture, then this type of tourism activity is called cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit different landmarks in a particular country, or they may focus on visiting only one area.
Seeing this activity, the colonists also demanded reinforcements.
The supporting forces at the front line position included the 200-man New Hampshire 1st and 3rd Regiments, commanded by Colonel John Stark and Colonel James Reid (later to become General).
Stark's soldiers were stationed along the defensive walls at the northern end of the colony's front.
When the tide receded, the mysterious river that flowed along the northeastern part of the peninsula opened a gap, quickly building a short stone wall, extending the wall to the small beach at the northern end of the peninsula.
Gridley or Stark placed a log at 100 feet (30 meters) before the battle and ordered no fire before the regular army passed.
The US plans to launch a coordinated attack from three different directions.
General John Khadward will launch an offensive against the British garrison at the town of Bodden, diverting the enemy's attention, to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing led 700 militiamen across the Trenton Pass, captured the bridge over the Assenpike Bay, blocked the enemy's escape route.
The main force of 2,400 men will cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups, one led by Greene and the other by Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
The change from a quarter mile to a half-mile race, speed became less important, endurance became an absolute factor.
Of course, to become a top-class half-mile runner, you must be fast enough and have endurance at all costs.
Practicing cross-country running in winter, coupled with upper-body fitness, can prepare you well for the running season.
Proper nutrition is not enough to produce excellent performance, but it can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, maintaining a habit of effectively supplementing with water, understanding all aspects of the rational use of nutritional supplements, can help athletes improve performance, increase sports enjoyment.
Mid-range running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, participants have a lot of misconceptions about a few pieces of equipment needed.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most products have little real impact on performance.
Athletes may think they are more likely to prefer a product, even though it is of no use.
Atoms can be considered as one of the basic building blocks of all matter.
According to the simplified polar model, this is a very complex entity, containing a central atomic nucleus surrounded by electrons, which look a bit like planets orbiting the sun.
The atomic nucleus is composed of both neutrons and protons.
Protons carry positive electricity, neutrons carry no electricity. electrons carry negative electricity.
To inspect the victim, you must first inspect the scene, ensuring your own safety.
When approaching a victim, you should pay attention to his posture and any unconscious danger signals.

The ability to see or see depends on the sensory organ of the visual system, the eye.
There are many types of eye structures, the complexity of which depends on the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different functions, sensitivities to different wavelengths, and different sensitivities.They also require different processing methods to understand input, and require different amounts of input to achieve optimal performance.
A population is a collection of specific species of organisms within a specific geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are exactly the same at the same time on a particular type of shape, it is called monotypic.
When an individual exhibits several variables of a certain characteristic, they are polymorphic.
The progression and nesting of the marines are also divided into different stages.
During the migration phase, the troops marched at night, stopped and camped during the day.
When the food available is reduced, this group will enter a period of migration. At this stage, the groups will build temporary nests that are replaced daily.
This kind of nomadic strikes would last for about 17 days each time.
What is a cell? cell is derived from the Latin cella, meaning small room, originally created by microscopists who observed the structure of softwoods.
Cells are the basic unit of all living things, and all living things are made up of one or more cells.
In fact, cells have such a fundamental and critical position in biological research that they are often called the basic units of life.
The nervous system maintains the smooth flow of blood by sending nerve impulses throughout the body, thus maintaining balance within the body.

Many people dream that one day humans can migrate to other planets, explore other worlds. Some people wonder what the universe is like; others believe that there may be aliens or other life on other planets.
But if this really happens, it probably won't happen again for a long time. These stars are very scattered, with their neighbors billions of miles apart.
Perhaps one day, your grandchildren's descendants will live in an alien world, guessing what life their ancient ancestors lived like at that time.
Animals are made up of many cells. Animals digest food in their bodies after eating it. Most animals are able to move.
Only animals have brains, but not all animals have brains, such as the mermaid.
Every corner of the earth has the image of animals; some of them are digging underground, some are swimming in the ocean, some are flying in the sky.
Cells are the smallest structural and functional unit of any organism.
Cell (cell) is a word derived from the Latin cell meaning small room.

Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw a few small squares hidden in the softwoods under the microscope.
They look like rooms.He was the first person to observe the dying cells.
Elements and compounds can change the state of matter under chemical changes.
The gaseous  still has the same properties as liquid 
Another example is water.The compound water is composed of two  atoms and one oxygen atom.
Whether it is a gas, liquid or solid, its molecular structure is the same.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains unchanged.
Time is around us, influencing everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been the subject of study by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars.
The time we have been through is a series of events from the future to the present and past.
Time is also the way we use to compare the length of an event.
You can record the passage of time by observing repeated cyclical events.Zh cyclical events are regular events that occur over and over again.
Today, we use computers to process images and videos.
Complex animations can be built on a computer, and this type of animation is increasingly being applied to television and movies.
When recording music, it is often handled by complex computers, mixing the sounds together.
For a long time in the 19th and 20th centuries, the first inhabitants of New Zealand were thought to be Maori, who hunted a large bird called the scarecrow.
The theory then established the following view: the Maori migrated from Polynesia by large ships, and seized New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.
But there is new evidence that the Moriori belong to the mainland Māori people, who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own unique culture of noble peace.
There is another tribe on the Chatham Islands, the Maori who immigrated from New Zealand.
They call themselves Moriorizh people.There have been a few minor conflicts, and the Moriori people were eventually wiped out.

A "reasoning model" is a problem-solving technique that combines different ideas or fields to find solutions.
This type of thinking values speed, logic and accuracy, as well as other facts, re-applications of existing technologies and information gathering.
The most important factor in this thinking pattern is that there is only one correct answer.You only need to consider two answers, yes or no.
This way of thinking is not associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, are able to remember patterns, solve problems, and can conduct scientific tests.
So far, humans have been the best-read species of people.
This means that we can successfully predict the perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge or desires of others.
Understanding the intentions of others is essential to these abilities. With this ability, we can understand the various problems that physical behavior may express.
For example, if you see someone breaking a car window, you are likely to think that this person is stealing a stranger's car.
If he lost his car keys, tried to open the door to his car, he might have to make a different choice.
The magnetic resonance imaging base is a type of physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Blohch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Persher (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to emit faint radio signals.
In 1970, MD and research scientist Raymond Damadian discovered the basic principles of using MRI as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was granted, the world's first patent in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the manufacture of the first full-body nuclear magnetic resonance imaging scanner, which he called the "R" scan.
Asynchronous communication gives people time to think about how others react and react.
This allows students to learn at their own pace and control the pace of teaching information.

Students can access information at any time using the Internet and the World Wide Web.
Students can also submit questions to the teacher at any time of the day, and can expect a quick response within a reasonable time, without having to wait for the next interview.
The postmodernist method of learning gives people absolute freedom. There is no one way to learn that is a good way to learn.
In fact, nothing requires special learning. When the learner experiences the presentation of knowledge, the learning behavior takes place.
We have already illustrated this with all the experiences of DIY, presentation information and TV shows with learning as the main content.
Many of us find that the TV shows we watch tell us about a process or experience, but we never participate in or apply that knowledge.
We will never make major repairs to cars, build a fountain in the backyard, visit ancient sites in Peru, or renovate neighboring houses.
Thanks to the submarine cable and broadband satellite connections to Europe, Greenland's network connectivity is at its peak, with 93 percent of the population having access to the Internet.
