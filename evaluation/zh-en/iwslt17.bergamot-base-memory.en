Well, I'm going to tell a story about how we know what we know.
This story is about this woman, Natalia Liczynski.
She is a paleontologist, and her specialty is to dig old things everywhere.
Natalia Liczynski: "Yes, some people call me 'Dead' Doctor."
I think she's particularly interesting, because the places she digs are in the Arctic Circle at high latitudes, in the distant Canadian permafrost belt.
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at an archaeological excavation site called the Fars-Ye bed, which was less than 10 degrees from the magnetic north pole.
NR: “It doesn’t really sound like that.” “You’re carrying a bag all day, with a GPS navigator and a notebook,” “You’ve been traveling a long way to pick up something that might be fossil.”
At one point, however, she noticed something.
"A piece of rusty little thing,' probably the size of my palm."
"It's lying on the ground."
Her first reaction was that it was nothing more than fragments of wood, because it was something that had been found in the Fars leaf bed—prehistoric plant bodies.
But that night, back to the camp...
NR: “I took out my hand-held microscope,” I observed more closely, and I suddenly found, “This thing doesn’t look like an annual wheel.”
"It may be because of the preservation problem," "but it really looks like..."
"The Bones."
So in the next four years, she went back to that location, and finally collected 30 pieces of debris, all from the same bone, many of which were very small.
"It's not a lot. A small zip bag can be packed."
Then she tried to put the pieces together like a puzzle.
But this is very challenging.
"It broke into a lot of tiny pieces," "We tried to restore it with sand and oil ash, but it looked bad."
"In the end, we used a three-dimensional surface scanner."
“That’s great, isn’t it?”
Finally, it is much easier to recover in a virtual way.
"When they're all put together, it feels really amazing."
How sure are you to spell it right, that is, to spell it as it is?
Is it possible that you will fight in another way, and finally spell out... a little parrot or something?
"Well, it's not. We're sure we're right."
She found that she spelled out a tibia, that is, a calf bone, and that the tibia came from a kind of hoof-purpose mammal, such as cattle, sheep and the like.
But it can’t be a cow or a sheep.
It's too big.
"It's a really big size thing. It's a huge animal."
So what kind of animal would it be?
Now she's stuck with a bottleneck, so she shows a piece of it to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and then they have ideas.
"We used to put a little saw, and then scraped a little bit at the corner of the debris, "and then from there came out with some very magical smell."
It smells a bit like charred skin.
It was a smell that Natalia knew, and she smelled it when she cut the skull in a general anatomy lab, and that was collagen.
Collagen gives our bones hardness.
Generally, after so many years, it will naturally decompose.
However for this situation, the Arctic seems to be a natural freezer to keep it.
A year or two later, Natalia went to Bristol for a conference where she saw one of her colleagues, Mike Buckley, demonstrating a new technology he called “collagen fingerprinting technology.”
In fact, the collagen of different species has tiny differences in structure, so if you have a collagen information about an unknown bone, you can compare it to the collagen information of a known species, so who knows, maybe you’ve found the information that matches it.
So she sent Mike a piece of debris, with FedEx.
"Of course, you're going to keep an eye on the delivery schedule. It's important."
He then processed the sample and compared it to 37 contemporary known mammal species.
I found a pair!
The final conclusion is that Natalia's discovery in the Arctic Circle of the high latitudes, this 3.5-million-year-old bone, is from...
A camel.
I was thinking, what a joke?" "If we're not mistaken, it's amazing."
So they tested a whole bunch of debris, and for each piece got the same result.
However, judging by the size of the bone they found, it means that the camel is 30 percent larger than the modern camel.
The camel is about 2.7 meters high and weighs one ton.
(Annoying) Yes.
Natalia discovers an “Arctic camel.”
Now that you hear the word “camel,” the picture that comes to mind is: the twin peak camels in East Asia and Central Asia.
But it's more likely that the image in your mind is more picturesque: a dimpoen camel, a typical desert animal, often in hot deserts, such as the Middle East or Sahara, with an oversized hump on its back that stores water for the long trek in the desert, and a large foot that helps them step over the sand dunes.
So how did these guys get to the Arctic Circle?
In fact, scientists have long known that before Natalia's discovery, camels originated from the Americas.
(Music: American National Anthem "Song of the Star-Spangled Banner") They originated here.
In the 45 million years that came camels have existed, 40 million years, you could only find them in North America, and there are 20 different species, perhaps more.
“If we line them up in a row, do they look different?”
"Yes, their bodies vary greatly."
“Some of the necks are particularly long,” so they function much like a giraffe.
Some have long noses, like crocodiles.
"They're particularly primitive, and some of the earliest ones may be very small," "almost like a little rabbit."
What is a rabbit-sized camel?
“The first ones are.”
“You probably don’t recognize them.”
Oh my god, I want a rabbit camel to be a pet!
“I know, it’s going to be great, isn’t it?”
Then, about 3 to 7 million years ago, one branch of the camel migrated south to South America, where they evolved into American halames or alpacas, and another branch crossed the Bering Land Bridge to Asia and Africa.
At the end of the last glacial period, the camels in North America were completely extinct.
Scientists already know this, but that doesn’t fully explain how Natalia found camels in the north.
Here, from a temperature point of view, it is the opposite of the Sahara.
To be honest, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher than it is today.
So it could be a northern forest, a bit like today's Yukon River or Siberia.
However, they are still six months long in the winter, and all the ponds will be frozen.
You will see a snowstorm.
You will experience 24 consecutive hours of night.
What is going on...?
How could these Sahara Desert superstars survive in this harsh cold condition?
Natalia and her colleagues felt they had found the answer.
And the answer is pretty smart.
What if these characteristics of camels, unlike what we think, arise to adapt to the Sahara, but evolved by going through the harsh winters?
What if the big feet didn't step over the sand dunes, but like snow boots?
If those humps—that’s pretty big news! It’s not water but fat that’s stored, and the hump is actually about getting the camel through the food-scarce, six-month-long winter.
If, far after that, they cross the mainland bridge, they will transform these winter characteristics to adapt to the hot desert environment.
For example, those humps may be good for camels in hot areas, because when your fat accumulates in the same place, you know, like a “fat backpack,” meaning that your body’s insulation doesn’t have to cover your body.
This makes the heat easier.
It was this crazy idea that made the camel's seemingly typical desert features suddenly become evidence that they originated in the high-latitude Arctic.
I’m not the first to tell this story.
Others have already said that they admire the magic of biological evolution, or take a glimpse into the future of climate change.
But I love this story for a different reason.
To me, it’s a story about us, about how we know the world, about how that perception has changed.
My profession is historian.
I have found that many scientists are also historians.
They understand the past.
They tell the history of the universe, the earth and the creatures of the earth.
As a historian, you have a thought in your mind about how this story goes.
“We make up stories, and then we go down our lines,” “It’s like a camel in the desert, right?”
“It’s a great story! The camel is perfect for the desert.”
“Obviously, the camels have been living there.”
But at any time, you may find some small clues.
You may find something small that forces you to reinvent everything you think you know.
As this example, this scientist discovered the fragment, and she thought it was wood, and it was because of this discovery that the scientific community gave birth to a new, counter-intuitive theory that explains why this strange, mearing creature, looks like a monster, what it is to grow into what it is.
For me, this completely subverts my view of camels.
It went from being a creature that was only for this particular environment to a globe-trotter, just happening to be in the Sahara Desert, and could be anywhere at any time.
This is Azuri.
Azuli, are you all right?
Come on, I brought you some food.
Azuli had just finished her special performance, coming from Radio City Music Hall in New York.
This is not a joke.
Seriously, Azul is here as a vivid example of how the story of the world is changing rapidly.
We need to be proactive, to boldly make changes and reimagine them.
Azuli, are you right?
True, our new perspective on the world is only the distance of a broken bone.
Thank you very much.
Today’s computers are so amazing that we even ignore how bad they actually are.
Today I’m going to talk to you about this and how we can solve it with neuroscience.
First of all, I’m going to take you back to a cold night in Harlem in 2011, which had a profound meaning for me.
I was sitting in a bar next to Columbia University, where I majored in computer and neuroscience, and I was having an interesting conversation with a classmate about the power of holography that would one day replace a computer.
Just as our conversation was wonderful, unsurprisingly, his phone rang.
He picked up his phone and started typing.
Then from time to time he looked up and said, "Go on, I'll listen."
But it was clear that his eyes were not concentrated, and a wonderful moment was fleeting.
Meanwhile, across from the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone, this time around a group of people in front of the screen.
He’s looking at the photos on Instagram, and the kids are laughing.
They were so happy with the same technology, and I was so frustrated that this strong contrast immediately caused me to think.
As I thought more deeply, I became more and more aware that it was obvious that the problem here was not electronic information, but just the position of the information that separated me from my friend and brought these children together.
It's clear that they're being connected by something, just as our ancestors evolved their social perceptions, such as telling stories around a bonfire.
I think that’s exactly what the tool should do.
They should extend our physical function.
I think today, computers are doing the opposite.
Whether you're sending an email to your wife, giving a symphony, or just comforting a friend, you're almost doing the same thing.
You stoop over these squares, play with buttons and menus, and more squares appear.
I felt it was the wrong way, and I felt we could start using a more natural machine.
The machines we use should be able to bring our work back to real life.
We should use machines that can use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses, not to limit our effects.
Now I have a machine like that.
It’s called Meta 2.
Let's try.
Now I can see the audience, and I can see my hands.
In counting to 3, 2, 1, we will see an image of a hologram, a very real holographic photograph appearing in front of me, in front of the glasses I now wear.
Of course this can be anything we're going to buy, or something we're going to learn, and I can control its movement with my hands very easily.
And I think Iron Man would be proud.
We will be back later.
(Applause ) If you're thinking like I do, you're already thinking about doing something with this technology, let's take a look at some examples.
My mom was an architect, so it was natural that the first thing I imagined was to draw a three-dimensional building, rather than using a floor plan of these planes.
In fact, she’s now touching the design drawing to choose an interior decoration.
All of this was filmed by the GoPro in my glasses.
The next use case was very personal to me, and it was Professor Adam Gozere’s Glass Brain Project, here thanks to the authorization of UCSF.
As a neuroscience student, I’m always amazed at the ability to learn and remember these complex brain structures with a real machine so I can touch and fiddle with different brain structures.
Now what you’re seeing is called augmented reality, but to me, it’s just part of a more important story — about how we start using digital devices to extend our bodies, not limit our physical function.
Then -
In the next few years, humanity will undergo a transformation, I think.
We're going to start covering a whole digital layer of information in the real world.
Take a moment to imagine what this means for the storyteller, for the painter, for the brain surgeon, for the interior decorator, maybe for all the people we are here today, really mean.
I think what we're going to do as a group is really try and try to imagine how we can create this new reality, in a way that extends the human experience, rather than gamifying our reality, or mixing reality and digital information together.
That’s what I’m very interested in doing.
Now I want to tell you a little secret.
In about five years—a device that won’t be the smallest—in about five years, these will look like striped glasses placed in front of you, capable of projecting holographic images.
Just like we don't care much about the hardware parameters of different phones — which one we buy, which one we think about the operating system — as a neuroscientist, I always want to build a kind of brain-based iOS, if I can.
It’s very, very important that we want to make sure it works, because these things may not be more time around than our access to the Windows image user interface.
I don’t know what you think, but living in Windows makes me feel a little scary.
In order to isolate a single, most intuitive contact interface to an infinite distance, we use neuroscience to guide our design, rather than having a group of designers argue in the design room.
The principle of our evolution is called the “minimal resistance neural piping.”
At every moment of change, we connect the iOS system of the brain to our brain, the first time, with the language of our brain.
In other words, we’re trying to create a zero-learning curve computer.
We are building a system that you always knew how to use it.
These are the first three design guides we’ve used in this new form of user experience.
First, you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they give your brain a few more curves to decode them.
We are on opposite routes to the “minimal resistance neural pipeline.”
At the same time, in augmented reality, you can certainly put your holographic TED display here, put your holographic email on the other side of the table, and your spatial memory can be just evolved to extract this information accurately.
You can put Tesla’s holographic photography in the online shopping here — or my legitimate team to tell me any mode before coming to power.
Well, your brains do know how to get back to reality.
The second interface guide is called “contact visualization” by us.
What do babies do when they see what they are interested in?
They will try to reach out and catch it.
Natural machines work that way.
In fact, the visual system has a very basic driving force, which we can call ontology sensations—the feeling that all parts of our body are in space.
By being in direct contact with our work, we not only control it better, but also understand it more deeply.
This is “contact vision.”
But it's not enough to experience things ourselves.
We are social animals.
This reminds me of our third guide, the bonfire of holography from our first story:
Our mirrors—neurological subsystems—show that we can better associate ourselves with everyone and our work, if we can see stereoscopic images of each person’s face and hands.
So, if you look at the video behind me, you can see that two Meta users are operating the same holographic image, building eye contact, focusing on this thing, rather than being distracted by external devices.
Let’s try again with the concept of neuroscience.
Again, our favorite interface, the iOS system of the brain.
I'll take a step forward now, go ahead and grab the pair of glasses, and put it on the table.
I'm in a moment with you, we're connecting.
My spatial memory is working, and I can go over and grab it, and then bring it back here to remind myself that I’m an operating system.
Now that my body feels like I’m working, I can use the past to blast these glass into thousands of pieces of debris, and then touch the sensor that’s scanning my hand at this moment.
But it’s not enough to just see that, so soon, my co-founder Ryan will be calling me in 3D.
Hi Ryan, how are you?
Ladies and gentlemen, I can see this person appearing in front of me in the form of a three-dimensional projection.
And his image is very real.
(Applause) Thank you.
My mirror-neural subsystem shows that this will replace the phone in the near future.
Ryan, how are you?
Ryan: I'm fine. We can finally show it live.
(Applause ) Ryan, give you a small gift from the holographic brain we saw before in the short film.
This will not only change the way we call, but it will change the way we work together.
Thank you very much.
Thanks, Ryan.
Ryan: You're welcome.
(Applause ) - Well, folks, here's the message I found in that bar in 2011: The future of computers isn't locked in these screens.
It’s here, in our bodies.
So if I can leave you today with an idea, it's that the nature machine doesn't exist only in the future imagination, it's here, it's there in 2016.
That’s why at Meta’s hundreds of employees, including administrators, executives, designers, engineers — before TED2017, we’re going to throw away our external display devices and replace it with a truly more natural machine.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) Thank you.
Thank you all.
Chris Anderson: I have a problem, and there have been a lot of shows about holography last year.
Sometimes there is a debate in the field of technology, about whether we're really seeing the real thing on the screen?
This is a problem in this area, and to some extent technology is showing a broader perspective than what you actually see with your glasses.
Did we see the real effect?
M. GR. B. I was absolutely real.
Not only that, but we also used additional measurement technology, and we used GoPro to shoot through real lenses, and we got a variety of different short films you see here.
We want to try to realize the world's experience by seeing through the things we see through the glasses, not just seeing the parts.
CA: Thank you very much for the show.
MG: Thank you very much.
I am from one of the freest, most tolerant and promising cities in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up with a great Seattle family.
My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor, and I was grateful for their upbringing, because I could plan my life in the way I felt it was appropriate.
In fact, my choice is not the same as what my parents think.
When I was 19, I dropped out of college — out of school, or, more accurately, was fired.
I set out on the path to becoming a professional French trumpeter, which was my lifelong dream.
I performed chamber music in the United States and Europe, and I toured for several years, with the excellent jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
When I was in my twenties, I was excited to join the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a beautiful life!
And my parents never complained,
They supported me from the beginning to the end.
Even if it's not their dream.
In the past, they used to talk to neighbors and friends, "Our son wants to 'rest' for ten years."
And having an awkward conversation about my life I want to share with you.
I was 27 years old, I was back from Barcelona, it was Christmas, I was going home to visit my parents, and when I was helping my mother make dinner, the two of us were in the kitchen.
She was silent, not saying a word.
I think something is wrong.
I asked my mother, “Mom, what are you thinking?”
She said, "You and my dad are really worried about you."
I was surprised: “What, what are you worried about now?”
She replied, “I hope you answer my question honestly: Did you vote Republican?”
The truth is, I’m not interested in politics, I’m just a French trumpet blower.
But I kind of understood, and they sensed something, so a little confused.
I became a fantist of capitalism at the time, and let me tell you why.
Believe it or not, it is rooted in my long-standing study of poverty.
When I was a kid in Seattle, I remember the first time I was exposed to real poverty.
My family belongs to the middle class, but that’s certainly not real poverty.
Not at all.
The first time I saw the true face of poverty was in the early 1970s, when I was only six or seven years old.
Like many of us, this example is very ordinary.
It's a picture in National Geographic, a picture of an East African country, about the size of my child, flies flying in his face and swelling on his stomach.
I know he can’t get through, I know, and I can’t do anything.
Some of you may remember a painting that is not necessarily the same, but it is very similar to a painting.
It shows the Western world the unbearable poverty of the rest of the world.
That picture lingering in my mind, along with me growing up, going to school, going out, starting my own family.
I wonder, how was the boy?
Or how are the people like him in the rest of the world?
I started to look at this question, and even though I was no longer in college, I was still looking for answers: What happened to the world's poorest people?
Is it going to get worse, or is it getting better?
I finally found the answer and changed my life. I want to share it with you.
In fact, most Americans feel that from childhood, from the sight they have seen to the present,
If you ask Americans, “Is the world’s poverty problem worse or better?” 70 percent say hunger has been worse since the early 1970s.
But the fact is that.
This is a moment that makes me change my mind and make me realize.
Since 1970, the world's hunger level has fallen by 80% of the population whose daily living costs of no more than $1 after inflation-adjusted.
Since I was a child, the percentage of the world's poorest people has decreased by 80%.
And I don’t know this fact.
My friends, this is a miracle!
This is something we celebrate.
This is the greatest achievement of the anti-poverty in human history, and it happened in our lifetimes.
When I knew this fact, I thought, what makes it possible to get out of poverty?
Because if you don’t know the reason, it’s just a short-lived one.
We want to replicate success, to get the 200 million people who are still struggling with poverty out of the status quo, because that's the question we've been talking about: from the time I was a kid, the 2 billion poorest people, our brothers and sisters, out of poverty.
I want to save the remaining two billion people, so I have to know why.
I was looking for answers,
It’s not a political answer, because I don’t care about the political answer.
For now, I still don’t care.
I want the best answers from mainstream economists, whether it's left-wing, right-wing, and centrist economists.
Below
I began to talk about specific reasons.
From childhood to the present, 2 billion people have been lifted out of poverty.
There are five reasons for this: Globalization.
Second: Free trade
Third: Property rights
Fourth: The rule of law
Fifth: Entrepreneurship
These are the results of the free-market economic system that swept the globe after 1970.
I am not childish.
I know that the free market economy is not perfect, and I know that the free market economy does not meet all the needs of us to build a better world.
But it is great.
And it goes beyond politics.
This is what I learned and realized.
Capitalism is not just about the accumulation of capital.
The best part of it is that it is related to ambition, which many on this stage have said, an ambition born of dreams, rooted in the free market system.
We need to get more people to understand this.
Now, I want to talk about my second epiphany, which has to do with the first one, and I believe that it will not only promote the development of the world, but also the development of our country.
To sum up the point of just taking people out of poverty in one sentence: “The free market has created the greatest wealth in history.”
And it lifts hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.”
Whose words?
Like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
wrong!
It's President Obama!
Why do I remember deeply?
Because he said it to me.
I can't think of it.
I said, “Hallelujah!”
Not only that, I said, "What a great opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, we did an event at Georgetown University about the topics we do.
Then I thought about the solution to the biggest problem facing the United States today. What was that?
Whether liberals or conservatives, come together to discuss these ideas and help those who need us the most.
Needless to say, everyone present knows that we are in crisis, in the United States and in other countries in the world with political differences.
This issue is imminent.
This is a concern.
Last year, an article was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most influential and cutting-edge scientific journals in the West.
That was a 2014 article about political incentives asymmetric.
Psychologists describe this phenomenon as assuming that your idea is based on love and the other person's idea is based on hate.
This is very common in world disputes.
For example, between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
The author of this article found that in today's United States, a large proportion of Republicans and Democrats are divided on political motives.
Most people who are politically active in our country today think they are driven by love, and the rest are driven by hate.
Think about it.
Most people always say, “My mind is based on love, I want to help people, and the other part of them, they’re evil, they’re trying to knock me down.”
Societies with such differences cannot progress.
It is impossible.
How do we solve this problem?
First, let’s be honest: there are differences.
We cannot reduce our differences because it is childish behavior.
There is a lot of in-depth research on this.
My friend Jonathan Headt is a regular at TED.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He studies the thoughts, values, and morals of different people, and how they differ.
He proved that conservatives and liberals have very different views on what they think is important.
Jonathan Hayd, for example, illustrates that liberals care about poverty 59% more than they care about economic freedom.
Conservatives, on the other hand, care about economic freedom 28% more than they care about poverty.
It seems irreconcisable, right?
Can we come together?
Our strength lies precisely in our differences.
Remember what stopped poverty:
It is the obsession and concern for poverty, and the free economic order around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people, we want to help the other 200 million people out of poverty.
No other law.
Well.
What are we going to do?
It’s a very delicate thing, isn’t it?
We want innovative thinking.
A lot of innovative ideas are on this stage.
The extraordinary social entrepreneurship.
We want to invest overseas in a sustainable, responsible and ethical way.
But do you know what we really need?
We need to open a new world of flexible thinking,
We need less “foreseeable.”
Is it?
Have you ever felt that your thoughts were beginning to become predictable?
Start following the rules?
Do you feel that you always listen to people who agree with you?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, on the one hand, conservatives are talking about taxes, rules, and big government.
And on the other hand, liberals, talking about the economy, is always about income inequality.
Those are really important, important to me, and important to you.
But those who are starving need our help, and these are just distractions.
We should unite in the best way possible, to reduce poverty as best we can, only when conservatives realize that they need liberals to worry about poverty, and liberals need conservative obsession with free markets,
We will succeed. Only by choosing this path will this diversity breed the power of the nations of the future.
How do we achieve this goal and how do we achieve it together?
I have some action advice for you and for myself.
Rule 1 of the Code of Action: Remember, just tolerating other people's different opinions is not good enough,
Far from enough.
We need to remember who we need to disagree with us, because there is a group of people who need help from all of us, and they are still waiting.
What are you going to do? how do you show up?
Where to start? from here!
For everyone here, we are all happy.
We have those who listen to us.
We are successful and we have leadership.
When people hear the idea of our unknown ideology, perhaps they will listen to us.
Maybe that’s the starting point for success.
This is the first point. 2.
The second point: I am asking you, and I ask myself to be a specific individual with blurred lines, to be a vague, indefible person.
If you’re a conservative, be a conservative who often talks about poverty and sticks to his moral obligations to fight for the poor.
If you’re a liberal, be a liberal who often praises the glamour of the free market in which we run responsibly.
If we do that, the two goals are just around the corner.
First: We're starting to work to help the next two billion people, as they've solved so many problems before, and we're going to solve them more. That's what we can do.
The second is that we may be able to overcome this terrible ideological war that afflicts us, transforming it into competition based on ideas of solidarity and mutual respect.
Maybe it will be, but maybe we'll find that our so-called differences are not that irreconcible.
thanks!
When I was in college, I was a professional in government, which meant that I had to write a lot of papers.
When an average student writes a thesis, they may, like this, split the task away.
So, you understand that it may start a little slow, but a week later has been a lot of writing, and then sometimes write more, and finally everything is done, things will not mess up.
I want that too.
At least my plan is like that.
I was ready to start, however, in fact, by the time I wrote the paper, I did.
And every time I write a paper like this.
Finally, when it comes time to write a 90-page graduation thesis, it should take a year to write a thesis.
I know that for such a paper, my usual approach does not work.
The graduation thesis is a big project.
So I planned it well and decided to do it.
This is how a year’s work is arranged.
At first, do less, the middle of the months continue to do a little more, and finally the high-speed file to go all out like a small step.
How hard is it to climb the stairs?
It's no big deal, right?
But then, something funny happened.
In the first few months?
Come and go, I basically don’t do anything.
So there's this great change plan.
And then... the middle of a few months went by like this, and I basically didn’t write a few words, so it became like this.
Then from two months to another month, and then only two weeks.
Then one day I suddenly realized that I was only three days away from the deadline, and I didn't write a word, so I did the only thing I could do: I spent 72 hours writing 90 pages, and I didn't have to go through the campus for two full nights all night, and I dived in slowly and handed over the paper before the deadline.
I thought it was all over.
A week later I got a call from the school.
They asked, “Are you Tim Erban?”
I said, “That’s right.”
They said, "We've got to talk to you about the paper."
I answered, “Okay.”
The other side went on, "This is the best paper we've ever seen."
(Applause ) That didn't happen.
This paper is very bad.
I just wanted to enjoy this moment, when you all thought, “This guy is too bull!”
Not so, that paper is super bad.
Anyway, I’m a blogger now.
I wrote a blog post for “Breaking the Casserole Ask to the End.”
A few years ago I decided to write an article about delay.
My procrastination behavior always confuses those around me who don't procrastinate, so I want to explain to those who don't procrastinate what the procrastinator thinks in his head, and why we procrastinators do.
My assumption is that the brains of procrastinators are different.
To prove this, I found an MRI lab so that I could scan my own brain and a brain that had been shown to be not a procrastinator, and then I could compare the two brains.
I brought them all today.
I hope you can seriously compare whether there is any difference between the two.
I know you're not a trained brain expert, and it may not seem obvious, but let's take a look, okay?
This is the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now,
This is my brain.
There is a difference between the two.
There is a rational decision maker in both brains, but in the procrastinator's brain, there is also a monkey called instant satisfaction.
What does this mean for the procrastinator?
It means that everything is fine before this happens.
So when rational decision makers make rational decisions, and when they want to do something productive, the monkey doesn't want to, so he starts to take control of the wheel, and he says, "Actually, let's read about the scandal of Nancy Kregan/Tenny Harding on Wikipedia, because I just thought about it."
Then let’s walk to the fridge and flip through what’s new for 10 minutes.
After that, let’s continue browsing on the video site, starting with the video Richard Feynman talking about magnetism, and always seeing an interview with his mother, Justin Bieber, seeing the wilderness.
“It’s all taking time, so we can’t take the time to work in our schedule today.
I'm sorry!"
What's going on?
Instantly satisfying the monkey doesn’t seem to be the one you want him to control.
He is completely living in the present.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, he only cares about two things: simplicity and happiness.
In the animal world, that’s fine.
If you are a dog, you have lived this life simply and happily, it has been a huge success!
For monkeys, humans are another animal.
You sleep well, you eat, you breed the next generation, and you may not be a problem in the tribal age.
But if you haven’t noticed, we’re not living in tribal times right now.
We are in an advanced civilization, and monkeys don’t understand what that is.
That’s why we have another guy in our heads, a rational decision maker, who gives us the ability to do things that other animals can’t.
We can anticipate the future.
We can take care of the whole big picture.
We can make long-term plans.
And he wants to take all of this into account.
He wants us to do anything that is worth doing now.
Sometimes doing simple and happy things makes sense, like eating, sleeping, or enjoying the leisure time you deserve.
That's why there's a real-time convergence between the immediate satisfaction of monkeys and rational decision makers.
Sometimes they agree.
But sometimes, it makes more sense to do things that are more difficult and less enjoyable, and that’s for the sake of the whole picture.
At this point, there will be a conflict between the two.
For the procrastinator, every time the conflict ends this way, it's that he spent a lot of time in the orange zone, the simple and happy, but meaningless area.
I call this area a dark playground.
The dark playground is a place that all procrastinators know.
This is a place for leisure and entertainment when you should not have been relaxed.
The happiness in the dark playground is not happiness, because it is completely unearned, which brings guilt, fear, anxiety, self-hatred, which is the feeling of all procrastinators.
And the question is, in this case, the monkey is in control of the steering wheel, how can the procrastinator take himself to the blue area, although it is not so comfortable, but there are a lot of important things to do.
In fact, the procrastinator has a guardian angel who always despises him and guards him, and in those darkest moments it is called a panic monster.
Panic monsters spend most of their time hibernating, but when the deadline is very close, or when they are in danger of being in ugly in public, or when they are facing a career disaster, or when there are other terrible consequences, it will suddenly wake up.
And importantly, he was the only thing a monkey was afraid of.
The Panic Monster has become so important in my life recently, because the TED staff contacted me 6 months ago and invited me to give a talk.
Of course, I promised.
I used to dream of being able to give a TED talk.
(Applause ) But in this excitement, rational decision makers seem to be thinking of something else.
He would say, “Do we know what we just promised?
Do we now have the ability to complete that task in the future?
We have to sit down and start working."
And the monkey said: "Totally agree, but let's turn on Google Earth and push the lens 200 feet underground in India, and then spend two and a half hours rolling up to the surface of this country, let's feel more deeply about India."
That was what I did that day.
When six months becomes four months, then two months, then a month, then a month, the TED staff begins to post the speaker.
I opened the website to see my face staring at myself.
Guess who woke up at this time?
So the panic monster started going crazy, and after a few seconds, the whole system was in disarray.
And the monkey, remember, he was afraid of panicking monster, he climbed to the tree!
So finally, rational decision makers can finally control the steering wheel, and I can start preparing for this speech.
In the case of the Panic Monsters, all those pretty stupid procrastinations, like people like me, spent two weeks unable to start writing the opening words of the paper, and then miraculously got an incredible enthusiasm for work, staying up all night and writing 8 pages.
The whole situation, plus those three roles is the procrastinator system.
Not good, but at least useful.
This is what I decided to blog about a few years ago.
After the release, the response I received surprised me.
I get thousands of emails, people from different places around the world, who do different things.
There are nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many other doctoral students.
It’s basically the same thing: “I have this problem too.”
But what impressed me was the contrast, the ease of the post and the contrast between the heavy tone of those messages.
These people have a strong sense of frustration because the procrastination affects their lives, because the monkeys control their thoughts.
After thinking about it, my question is, if the procrastinator system works, so what’s going on?
Why do these people have such a dark corner?
I found that there were two kinds of delays.
What I'm talking about today, the examples given above, have deadlines.
When there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are limited to a shorter period of time because the panic monster intervenes.
But for the second type of procrastination, it happens without a deadline.
For example, if you want to start your own business or do an art job, there is no deadline at first, because nothing happens until you have started working hard, and there is no push to get things going.
There is no deadline for important things other than your career, such as visiting your family, exercising to stay healthy, working to improve your relationship, or leaving an unhappy relationship.
If there is only one mechanism for procrastinators to do these difficult things, that is, panic monsters, then the problem arises, because in these cases without a deadline, the panic monster does not appear at all.
He didn’t need to wake up, so the consequences of procrastination were unlimited, and they only postponed indefinitely.
And this long-term delay is less obvious than the more interesting, shorter-term, deadline-based delay, and is not often talked about.
It usually affects us quietly and quietly.
It may be the source of a lot of long-term unhappiness and guilt.
I think that's why those people send emails, and that's why they're in such a bad situation.
Not because they’re rushing for a project,
It is this long delay that makes them feel like they are in their own lives sometimes as if they were just a spectator.
Their frustration is not because they can’t achieve their dreams; it’s because they can’t even start chasing their dreams.
So after reading these emails, I had a little understanding that I didn’t think there were people without delay.
Yes, I think we are all procrastinators.
You may not be like us, every aspect is a mess, maybe some people can be nice to face the deadline, but remember: the most despicable trick of the monkey is the part that doesn't have a deadline.
Now I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the calendar of life.
Suppose a person can live to 90 years old, and every week is a lattice.
In fact, there are not many lattices, especially we have lived for so many years.
I think we all need to take some time to take a hard look at this calendar of life.
We need to think hard about what we really delay because everyone is procrastinating on something.
We have to be aware of the presence of instantly satisfying this monkey.
This is what we should all do.
And because there aren’t many lattices, this work should probably start today.
Well, maybe not today, but...
You know.
In the near future.
thanks.
The soul and the body were huddled in a Texas church, and that was the last night of our lives.
Just like our room now, it's just a squeaky wooden bench, with tattered red cloth strips, an organ on my left, a choir behind me, and a baptist pool built on the back wall.
Just like this room.
The same strong sense of suspense, the same deep desire for salvation, the same sour sweat in the palm of your heart, and the same group of absent-minded people in the back row.
It was December 31, 1999, that night, as far as I know, Christ's Advent, the world will come to an end.
I was 12 at the time, at a responsible age.
I found that it was so unfair that Jesus was coming back, and that I was about to take responsibility for all that I had done before. But when I stopped complaining, I thought I had better hurry up and clean up the house.
I go to church as much as possible.
I was afraid of the silence all around me, like a man afraid of noise, only to repeatedly confirm that God was not playing with me, and to come back early but to give me down.
But if he really came early, I also had a backup plan, which I read from the popular "The Lost Dooms" book.
I saw in the text that if after the midnight orgy, I was not taken away, I had another chance.
I just need not be called in the name of a pagan, defeat the devil, overcome the plague, and overthrow the antichrist.
It’s going to be pretty hard – but I’m sure I can do it myself.
But the time to prepare was too early.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We had 10 minutes left, and the pastor let us get up from the bench and walk to the altar below, because he wanted us to pray together at the moment of midnight.
So the congregation was divided into several batches and reached the designated location.
The choir was still on the small stage, with the church deacon and their wife—in fact, I prefer to call them the “breathing bourgeoisie” to sit in the first row in front of the altar.
You know, in America, even on the night of the Adventist Christ have VIP seats.
And behind the Baptist bourgeoisie are the older generation of men and women on their young backs, bent by the blazing sun in the cotton fields of East Texas, with gully and vertically sun-downed faces burning into a noble brown, like the clay of East Texas, whose good fantasies and dreams of life outside East Texas and the world are sometimes more broken than their backs.
Yes – these men and women are my idols and stars.
They waited for this moment for the rest of their lives, just as their medieval forefathers longed for the end of the world, just as my grandmother longed for the Oprah talk show, and every day at four o'clock on Channel 8.
As she walked up to the altar, I slipped behind her, because I was very sure that my grandmother was going to heaven.
I thought, if I held her hand tightly in this prayer, I might go with her.
So I held my grip, closed my eyes, listened, and waited.
Prayer is louder.
The cry of prayer is the same.
The organ sounded, interwoven with the sound of the elegy.
The heat wave swept, and the sweat of the hand was more sour.
My hands tightened, and I didn’t want to be abandoned by God.
My eyes were closed tighter, and I didn’t want to see the essence being taken away and the rostin was falling.
Suddenly a voice echoed overhead: “Amen.”
Finished.
I look at the clock.
It's past midnight.
I looked at the elders, their saviors did not come, they were so proud that they did not show even a little loss, they believed too deep, for too long, and now it is too late to doubt.
But I was angry for them.
They were fooled, they were deceived, they were deceived, but I was deceived with them.
I prayed the prayers they made, and I tried to resist the desires of my heart.
I don't do it once, but twice, one by one into the cold-hearted baptism.
I have believed.
What now?
I went home to turn on the TV, just in time for Peter Jennings to announce the new millennium, and the whole world was celebrating the New Year.
I suddenly realized that it was strange no matter what I thought, Jesus would come back to earth again and again, just because the time zones everywhere were different.
It made me feel worse, hurt, really.
But that night, I didn’t stop believing.
I just believe another thing: “It’s possible not to believe.”
It's likely that the answers as I know them are all wrong, and it's likely that the problem itself is wrong.
Now, once the mountain of faith, there is a spring flowing to the foot of the mountain, a questioning spring, it is destined to become a big river.
All the dramatic stories of my life can be traced back to the night in the church, when my savior did not come; what I was so sure of, if not called a “lie,” was not the truth.
Although most of you have welcomed the millennium in a very different way, I believe that you are here because some of you have done the same thing as me, after the beginning of the new century, the death of my mother, the things that happened after my father ran away from home, and what my savior did not come after.
I held out my hands and searched for something I could believe.
When I was 18 years old, I was searching, and I believed that from the small town of Texas along the way, I had a chance to get rid of all the hardships and hardships I had going through, to get rid of those broken dreams, the disabled bodies.
But when I returned home on winter vacation, my head was tucked on the ground, my hands tied behind my back, the robber's pistol against my head, I knew that even the best education could not save me.
When I went to Lehman Brothers for an internship in 2008, I was also searching.
Hopeful – I’m excited to call my family and say we’ll never get poor again.
But when I watched this financial temple, which was in front of me, I knew that even the best work could not save me.
When I went to Washington, D.C., to be a young journalist, I searched, and I heard a voice from Illinois: "It's been too long," but in this election, America is about to change.
But when the work of parliament has completely stalled, the country has almost fallen apart, and the so-called hope and change have become cruel jokes, I know that even the new birth of politics will not save me.
I bowed my knees in front of the altar of the American Dream, praying to the great men of the times, praying for success, asking for money, praying for power.
But every time, the midnight bells rang, and I opened my eyes and saw that all these myths were dead.
From this grave, I began to search again, not because I was brave, but because I knew that if I didn't have faith, I would die.
So I went to another shrine to worship, Harvard Business School — and this time, I knew I couldn’t simply accept the salvation the college had given.
No, I know I have more to do.
It all started in the dark corner of a crowded party, and it was late in the late night of Massachusetts' brutal early winter, and I asked three friends a question, and some young people who had real pursuits would ask for a long time: "How about we go out and drive?"
We don’t know where we’re going or how we’re going, but we know we have to go.
Because we've been hungry all our lives, as Jack Kerouac wrote, "Dive into the endless dark nights and disappear into the distant sky."
So even if there is a voice against us, saying that we have taken too much risk, there is no gain, we are still on our way.
We traveled 13,000 kilometers across the United States in the summer of 2013, walked through the dairy ranch in Montana, walked through the abandoned cities of Detroit, and walked through the swamp wetlands of New Orleans, where we found some people, working for them, and the small business they started, using their goals as the bottom line.
After studying at the “Capitalist Military Academy at West Point,” we realized that the idea was simply revolutionary.
The idea spread, eventually growing into a non-profit organization called “Master of Workmanship Traveling Across the United States,” which is the main reason why I was able to stand on the stage today.
It can spread because we have discovered a strong desire in this generation, a desire to achieve goals, the value of life.
It can spread because we found countless entrepreneurs in the corner of the United States, who created jobs, changed other people's lives, and needed a little help.
But to tell the truth, it can spread, and because I spread it desperately. In order to spread the gospel,
There’s nothing I don’t want to do, and in order to convince more people, we can heal the wounds of this broken country and rely on small businesses.
But it was this process of evangelism that led me to a different gospel, and today I'm going to share it with you.
About one night a year ago, we attended Harvard Business School’s alumni dinner at the Natural Science Museum in New York.
Under the full-scale model of a whale, I sat side by side with the giants of this age, singing praises to their companions and their great deeds.
The room was filled with pride, and the total assets of these people combined exceeded $500 billion.
We look down on all creation and think it is good.
Two days later, I went to Haring, New York, and I was sitting on a city farm in an abandoned parking lot, and I heard a man named Tony talk about some of the kids, and they went there every day.
They are all below the poverty line.
Many people put all their belongings in their backpacks, afraid of being stolen by others in the shelter.
Some people come to Tony’s farm, called “Harlem Grows Up,” to get their only meal of the day.
Tony told me that he started “Harlem Grows” by relying on his own pension, and he was a taxi driver for 20 years.
He said he didn’t give himself a penny because although the project was a success, resources were still scarce.
He said that any help he could find, he would accept.
And I’m going to help him.
But when I left Tony, I had a tingling in my heart, tears stubbing the corners of my eyes.
I felt the burden of enlightenment, and one night I could sit in my room and talk to hundreds of people worth $500 billion about the good world, but in another room two days later, there were only 50 blocks away, a man without a salary to offer his children the only meal they had ever had.
But it's not this dazzling social inequality that makes me cry, and it's not the hungry, homeless children, it's not the anger of the 1%, or the pity for the 99%.
No, I can't be calm in my heart because I finally realized that this country needs a radical change, and I'm just a little repair.
I realized that my story represented a group of people who wanted to be self-reliant, even if they were poor; that my organization represented, all-foundation, systematic help, but never reached Harlem, or the Appalachian Mountains and the Lower Nine District of New Orleans; and that my cry represented voices that sounded unrecommended, unmodified, and out of place.
And this sense of shame, this shame washed me away, like the shame of sitting in front of the TV at the time, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, again, again, and again.
I was fooled, I was deceived, I was deceived,
But this time, the hypocritical savior is myself.
You know, I came from that altar all the way, and that night I felt that the world was going to be destroyed, from a small town that used all dialects, that suffering was God's gift to mankind, and that it was still a creed, as an eternal truth.
Yes, my journey was so long that I went all the way back to the beginning.
Because we can't sum up, we can't say that there's no faith in this era. No, we believe in something as we've always believed.
Some people might believe the predictions of Breen Brown or Tony Robbins. We might believe the New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We may be incredibly confident in what we worship in the church at TED, but we desperately want to believe, and we need faith.
We imitate the rhetoric of charismatic leaders who commit to solving all human problems.
We feel that suffering is a gift given to us by the capitalist “God”, and we regard the development of science and technology as a creed and as an eternal truth.
But we never realized the human price we paid, and we don't question a brick because we're afraid the whole building will collapse.
But if you are troubled by these contrary things that we are accustomed to, the time for doubt will come.
So the gospel I preached was not a breakthrough, an innovation, or a sustainable development.
I don’t even have a gospel of faith to share with you.
All I have is the gospel of doubt.
Questioning the gospel is not about stopping you from believing, it asks you to believe in something new: “It’s also possible not to believe.”
It's likely that the answers we know are all wrong, and it's likely that the problem itself is wrong.
Yes, questioning the gospel may mean that our presence, on this stage, in this room, is all wrong.
Because it raises the question, “Why?”
We have such a powerful force in our hands, why are there still people in the heat of the water?
This kind of questioning made me make a decision, the organization I founded, the “Master of Work Management who has traveled all over the United States”, is going to stop operating.
We’ve disbanded our staff, closed our doors, and we’ve opened this model to everyone, and as long as they feel they’re capable of doing it, they don’t need our approval.
This questioning forced me to take off the “savior” hat that was put on my head, because our lives were too short and our chances were too low for Christ’s return, and the fact was that there were no miracles in the world.
And this doubt, it drives me, it gives me hope, when the difficulty is about to overwhelm us, when the path of fate seems to lead us astray, when our savior cannot heal the wounds, not our blind faith, but our simple doubts, will sprinkle a little light on our lives and the darkness of the world. Let's whisper,
The cry is also good, or simply, very simple: "There must be another way."
thanks.
The food crisis.
Appeared in the daily news.
What is that?
Some parts of the world are too food-poor, and in some places food production is abundant.
In some places, genetically modified foods have saved the world.
Maybe genetically modified foods are a problem?
Too much GM agricultural wastewater creates polluted oceans, toxic seawater, and thin nutrients.
This cycle continues.
I found that today's discussion is too influential.
How can we make such a discussion understandable to everyone?
What about the apple food crisis?
I’m sure you’ve all eaten an apple in the past week.
How long do you think the apple took from picking to your hand?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months -- that's the average time it takes for an Apple to be picked to sell in an American mall.
I think it should be pretty much the same in Europe, almost everywhere.
We picked apples, refrigerated them, and fed them oxygen into the freezer—in fact, there were documented records that workers had tried to enter such an environment to retrieve an apple and then died, because the air in the cold storage in the cold storage in such an environment was toxic to people.
Why doesn’t anyone among you know about this?
Why don't I know about this?
Ninety percent of the nutrients in the apple — all the antioxidants in the apple — were lost when we bought it.
It's just a little candy.
Why don't we know the news, and how can we improve this situation?
I think we’re missing a platform.
I know the platform — I use a computer, and I was active on the web when I was very young.
I’ve done a lot of weird things – on a platform like this.
But I also met other people, and I was able to express my thoughts.
What do you think about food?
If we had a platform, we might find that the problem was very beneficial, "What if?"
I would ask: What if the climate was democratic?
This is a global climate map.
The most efficient agricultural production areas are green, and the worst is red.
They will change, they will change, and California farmers will now become Mexican farmers.
China acquires Brazilian land for better food, and we are all slaves to the environment.
What if each country had its own climate suitable for production?
How will that change our lives?
How will that change the quality of our lives and nutrition?
The problem for the previous generation was that we needed more food and were cheap.
Welcome to the World Farm.
We built a huge simulated farm.
These lines – cars, planes, trains, and cars.
Being able to provide enough food to 7 billion people is a miracle, in the case of very few people involved in the food production process.
But if...
Are we building a digital farm?
The digital world of farms.
If you can take this Apple, in a way, digitize it, transmit it through the mass points in the air, and then reorganize the points on the other side?
What if?
Look at these quotes, you know, they encouraged me to do that.
Article 1: “There are no young people in Japanese agriculture, no water, no land, no future.” This is the day I arrived in South Sanlu, that is, Fukushima to the south, after the accident.
The children all went to Sendai and Tokyo, and the land was contaminated by the nuclear power plant accident, and their food imports reached 70%.
But this is not a phenomenon unique to Japan.
Only 2% of the American population is engaged in agriculture-related jobs.
What answer does 2% of the population working in agriculture give us?
Let’s take a look at the rest of the world, where 50% of Africa’s population is under the age of 18.
Eighty percent of them don’t want to be farmers.
Agriculture is hard.
Small farmers are working too hard.
They choose to go to the city.
In India: Farmers' families do not have access to the most basic agricultural appliances, and the number of farmers who commit suicide is higher than the number of farmers in the past 10 years.
It’s so sad to talk about these.
Where are they going?
to the city.
There are no young people, young people go to the city.
What kind of platform should we build to encourage young people?
Take a look at this new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago, I went to the home store and started looking for tools.
I made stupid things, I made plants dance, connected them to my computer, and then I destroyed them -- a lot.
I eventually allowed them to survive.
I created one of my most intimate relationships in my life because I learned the language of plants the most.
I want them to be bigger.
They said, “Son, do your best!
This electronic studio is not used by anyone.
What can you do?”
Together with team members, we built a farm in a media lab, a place that used to be thought to be about electronic life rather than biology.
In this 60-square-meter space, we produced enough rations for about 300 people for a month — not too much.
There are a lot of interesting technologies here.
The most interesting thing?
Beautiful, white rhiesome, dark green plants harvested once a month.
Is this a new restaurant?
Is this a new sales experience?
Is this a new store?
What I can be sure of is this: this is the first time that any plant can be uprooted in a media lab.
We put the salad in the bag; there was nothing wrong with it.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, a robotics expert, uprooted the plant and think, "Well, I know about -- I can make the plan come true, I want to try."
Throughout the whole process we'll take the plants out and get some back into the lab, because if you plant it yourself, we won't give it up; because it's precious to you.
I have this strange tongue now, because I don't want anyone to eat them before I do, and I hope it's delicious.
I eat lettuce every day, and I know that the pH of lettuce is less than 1.
I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat it today."
(Applause ) This lettuce is very sweet that day.
That's because lettuce feels a lot of pressure, and it produces chemical reactions to protect itself: "I don't want to die!"
The taste of plants that don't want to die is sweet.
Scientists are back in the study of plant physiology.
I think everyone can try to get involved.
We look forward to seeing our creations, so we've come up with a lab that can be shipped to other places.
Create such an idea.
The front of this media experiment building is my lab, with 30 points per plant.
If you know the genome or genetics, this is the phenotype, right?
The phenomenon presented by the phenotype group.
When you say, “I like the Mexican strawberries,” you really like the strawberries produced in that climate.
You can code this climate -- how much carbon dioxide, how much oxygen you've created -- you can program to control the state of the plant's presentation, and the nutrient content, plant size, shape, color, and texture.
We needed data, so we put a lot of sensors to give us data.
You can think of the plants in your home, and you look at the plants in the house, and you're sad, because you want to say, "Why are you dead?
Farmers have the most beautiful eyes to predict the future, when they are in their 60s and 70s,
They can tell you that the plant died because of the lack of nitrogen in the soil, the lack of calcium, or the need for a more humid air environment.
These beautiful eyes will not pass on.
These are the eyes of the farmer.
We will continue to collect data.
We combine these data points with separate plants.
These are the IP address data for all broccoli in my lab that day.
We have broccoli that can track IP addresses.
(Applause ) If that's weird enough, you can click here to see the plant's archive.
This shows you the process of growing that plant that can be downloaded, not as you think, not just informing you when it’s edible.
When did my nutrition meet my needs?
When does the taste meet my expectations?
Is there too much water?
Is the sun too long?
Everything will be suggested.
It can talk to me, it can communicate, we can talk in words.
(Applause ) I think, that's the first plant Facebook user, right?
At that time, the archives of plants will begin to make friends.
I mean really -- plants will start making friends with plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, and less potassium.
We will begin to understand the complex things that can only be guessed at now.
They may not be friendly with us -- I don't know, maybe they'll be good to us, it's up to us.
This is my current laboratory.
It’s a bit more systematic, my background is designing the hospital’s data center, and I know how to create a controlled environment.
So -- in this environment, we experiment with all kinds of things.
This program, the air-growing method, was developed by NASA for the Mir space station and was able to reduce the amount of water they need to be transported to space.
What this program does is to provide the plants exactly what they want. Water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots are not that complex, and when you send them to them, you can see the surprising results.
Plants have two hearts.
Because it has two hearts, it shows a high growth rate of 4-5 times.
It is a perfect world.
We've gone through a long history of technology seeking a different world, and we're going to continue to do that, but we're going to have new tools, and it's going to be a perfect world.
We grow all kinds of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercially produced for the past 150 years.
Did you know we have rare, old seed banks?
The Seed Bank.
That's awesome.
They have a living germplasm, and you have not eaten food.
I was the only person in this room who had eaten this tomato.
The problem is that this is the sauce tomato We don't know how to cook, so feel that the sauce tomato doesn't seem to taste good.
But we've grown all kinds of things that contain protein.
We’ve planted humans — maybe you can, but we can’t.
We realized that the tools were too big and too expensive.
I started putting them around the world, worth about $100,000.
It’s not easy to find someone who can spend $100,000 at will, so we want to make small tools.
This is actually a student project for me – undergraduate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Camille
Camille and I, along with my team, spent the entire summer repeating the experiment, how to make it cheaper, how to work better, how to make other people able to learn to operate.
Then we sent these tools to the school for the 7th to 11th grade children.
If you want to be humble, try to teach your child what to do.
I went to this school and said, “Set its humidity at 65%.”
A child in the 7th grade asked, “What humidity?”
So I said, "Oh, it's water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you idiot."
So I said, “Okay, don’t believe me.
In fact, don’t believe me, right?
Set it to 100.
He set the humidity to 100, what happened?
Start condensing, creating fog, and finally starting to drip.
Then he said, “Oh, humidity is rain.
Why didn’t you tell me that before?”
The interface we created looks like a game.
They have a 3D environment and are able to log in around the world from mobile phones, computers.
There are different parts of the program inside – physical adjustment, sensor.
They chose recipes that children in other parts of the world have created.
They select and activate recipes and plant seeds.
When the seeds grow, children can make changes.
They say, “Why do plants need carbon dioxide, isn’t CO2 a bad thing?”
It can suffocate.”
Increasing the supply of carbon dioxide, the plant is dead.
Reduce the amount of carbon dioxide, the plant is living well.
Harvesting plants, you create new electronic recipes.
This is a process of repeated design and development and exploration.
They can download all the data about the new plants they've developed, or what's the new electronic recipe -- is it better or worse?
Imagine that these are the core elements of processing.
We can learn a lot of things.
This is what we call a food computer, and it was put in a school for three weeks.
This is three weeks of cultivation.
What’s more, for the first time, the child thought he could be a farmer—or he wanted to be a farmer.
So we made these resources public.
Put them all online; go home and try to build your first food computer.
It’s going to be hard – I’ll tell you that.
We are in the beginning, but the resources are there.
For me, making these easy to achieve is very important.
We will continue to do so as well.
These are farmers, electronics engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, urban planners.
On a platform, do what they are good at.
The team became too big.
This is my new experimental equipment is starting to operate.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
That’s why I chose it.
In this warehouse, we have to build such a shelf.
You can see it now.
Look at this,
This also exists.
One grows green vegetables, one grows Ebola vaccines.
What's great is that Plants and this U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Bureau winning program are the reasons why we're working on Ebola .
These plants are producing proteins against Ebola.
So medicines and health care products, and then lettuce cultivation.
But these two things look completely different, and that's the part of my field.
But a lot of things are not what you think.
We're still in the "We're right" stage, like, "This is my little black box --" "No, buy me."
“No, no, no -- my intellectual property is absolutely valuable.
Don't buy this, buy mine."
In fact, we are only in the beginning, and at this time, society is also changing.
When we want more, cheaper food, we now need better, environmentally friendly food.
But you see the ingredients of McDonald’s advertising, the most mysterious food in human history — McDonald’s marketing program is changing — and everything is changing.
Now look at today’s world.
Personal food computers, food servers, food data centers, operate in open phenotypic groups.
It's like the open genome, but we're going to get the little climate recipes together, like Wikipedia, you can overturn, start, grow.
How does this look?
Do you remember that the world is connected by a rope?
I started to show up with bacon.
We started sending information about food instead of distributing it.
It’s not just my fantasy, it’s the work we’ve already done.
Food computers, food servers, and soon food data centers connect people to share information.
The future of food is not its fault.
We all know it’s wrong there.
The food of the future is about connecting the next billion farmers, and using a platform for question-and-answer sessions to empower them, “What if?”
thanks.
Sometimes I feel very ashamed to be a European.
Last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, is sad.
There are too many contradictions here.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old boy Alan Cody, but since then more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international conventions that recognize the acceptance of refugees as a shared responsibility of all countries, but we accept a small Lebanon that receives more Syrians than the whole of Europe.
We rebuke the existence of human smuggling, but we make it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe.
We have a labor shortage, but we're preventing people who can meet our economy and our population building needs, and we're trying to get into Europe.
We claim that our liberal values are contrary to those pursued by the originalists of Islam, however -- we use a repressive policy to detain children's asylum-seekers to separate children from their families, to forcibly confiscate refugee property.
What are we doing?
How the situation has progressed to such an extent that we are responding to a humanitarian crisis in an inhumane way.
I don’t believe it because people don’t care, at least I don’t want to believe it.
I think this is due to the lack of vision of our politicians, the lack of adaptations to what was proposed fifty years ago, in response to a changing and globalised one.
International refugee system So what I want to do is take a step back and ask two very basic questions, which we all have to understand.
First, why is the existing system not working?
Second, how do we solve it?
The modern refugee system was developed after World War II.
It was originally intended to ensure that when a country collapses or worse, the regime is hostile to the people of that country, and that these people can have a place to go and live there safely and with dignity until they can return home.
This is exactly what we see in Syria today.
Through an international conference co-signed by 147 governments 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and an international organization, UNHCR, an international organization, committed to allowing others to enter their territories among member states to escape conflict and persecution.
But now the system is collapsing.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policy blocks this path to security.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek equal treatment or to choose to return to their home country.
But in practice they are trapped in a state of almost indefinite stagnation.
In theory, the refugee problem is the responsibility of all countries.
In fact, geographical location means that countries close to disputes are overloaded with the vast majority of refugees.
The rules of the original refugee system are not the cause of their collapse.
It’s that we’re not using it enough with the world that we need to rethink.
So I want to explain to you how today's system works.
How does the current refugee reception system work?
But this is not from a macro-level perspective from the top, but from the perspective of individual refugees.
Imagine a Syrian woman.
We call her Amira.
Amira represents the many refugees I have met in the region.
Amira Like about a quarter of the world's refugees, it's a woman with kids, she can't go home, because of her city, because of the city you're seeing now, the city of Homs, the city that was once beautiful and historic, is now devastated.
So Amira couldn't go back.
Amira also has no hope of resettling in a third country because it is like winning the lottery, less than one percent of the world's refugees are only available.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice
They have three basic options.
The first is that Amira can take her family to the refugee camp.
In the refugee camp she might get help, but for Amira and her family The prospects are very slim.
The camp is located in a desolate and barren land, usually in the middle of a desert.
In the privatizes of Zatalina, Jordan, you can hear shells crossing the Syrian border at night.
Economic activity is limited there.
The quality of education is usually low.
And about 80 percent of the world's refugees in camps have to stay there for at least five years.
This is a tragic place and it may also explain why in reality only nine percent of Syrians have chosen this option.
Or Amira can go to a city in a neighboring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
75 percent of Syrian refugees choose this option
But even there is difficulty.
Refugees in cities usually do not have the right to work.
They usually have no access to assistance.
So when Amira and her family ran out of basic savings, they had very little left, and they were likely to face poverty.
There is a third option that is increasingly chosen by Syrians.
Amira can seek hope for her family, embark on a dangerous journey that could bury her life, go to another country, and that's what we see in Europe today.
Globally We leave a nearly impossible choice for refugees Among these three options Camps Urban Poverty and Dangerous Journeys
For refugees, this choice is the current global refugee system.
But I think it was the wrong choice.
I think we can reconsider this option.
The reason we limit these options is that we think these are the only options that refugees can get, but in fact they are not.
Politicians portray it as a matter of gain and loss If refugees benefit, citizens need to bear the loss.
We seem to agree with an assumption that refugees are the inevitable burden and cost to society.
But this is not a pre-determined formula, and refugees can contribute.
So what I want to prove is that we have a way to add that option and still benefit everyone: including host countries and communities, our society and the refugees themselves.
I'd like to suggest four ways to change our mindset for refugees
These four approaches have one thing in common, and we've taken advantage of globalization, social mobility, and market opportunities to update our understanding of the refugee problem.
I want to think first of all about the concept of creating an environment, and that's a basic idea, and that's what refugees are like all the others, just that they're in a particular environment.
My colleagues at the University of Oxford started a research project in Uganda to study the economic lives of refugees.
We chose Uganda, not because it is a typical representative of the receiving country.
It is an exception.
Unlike most of the world's host countries, what Uganda is doing is giving refugees economic opportunities.
Give them the right to work, give them freedom of movement
The results are striking, both for refugees and host countries.
In Kampala, the capital of Uganda, we found that 21 per cent of refugees started a company to run their own business and employed others, and 40 per cent of the employees were nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for the citizens of the host country.
Even in refugee camps, we found examples of dynamic, thriving startups.
For example, in a refugee camp known as Nakiwale, we found Congolese refugees, and we ran a business of trading digital music.
We found a business for Rwandan refugees so young people can play computer games on recycled rigs and displays
Breaking through the extremes, the refugees are constantly innovating, and before you are a Congolese named Damon-Kay.
He had no strength when he arrived in the refugee camp, but he wanted to be a filmmaker.
So with friends and colleagues he started a community radio station, and he rented a camera and he’s making a movie now.
He's made two documentaries, and our team, and he's got on to have a successful career with little resource.
It is precisely this example that should lead our response to refugees.
Instead of arguing that refugees inevitably depend on humanitarian assistance, we need to give them the opportunity to achieve human prosperity.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are very important in the emergency phase, but we have to think long-term.
We need the right to provide network connectivity, electricity education, work, funding and business channels
All the ways we take for granted access to the global economy can and should be provided to refugees
The second idea I want to discuss is the economic zone.
Unfortunately not all the host countries in the world have adopted the policy of Uganda.
Most host countries are not open to refugees, but we still have an effective alternative.
Last April I went to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Korya, where we discussed an idea with the international community and the local government, and the idea was to bring jobs to the Syrians while pushing for Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea is to create an economic zone In the economic zone, we can combine the employment of refugees with the national employment of the host country of Jordan.
Just a 15-minute drive outside the Zatali refugee camp, where 83,000 refugees are resettled is an existing economic zone known as King Hussein Development Zone
The government has invested more than $100 million to connect the transmission grid and roads, but there are two things missing, labor and foreign investment.
So what if refugees could work there instead of being trapped in a refugee camp, they would be able to build skills by building their homework and training in Syria before they return to Syria?
We recognize that doing so would benefit Jordan, and its national development strategy calls for upgrading manufacturing as a middle-income country.
Doing so benefits refugees and also contributes to Syria's post-war reconstruction by recognizing that we need to train refugees as the best resource for the eventual reconstruction of Syria.
We publish this view in the journal Foreign Affairs.
Jordan's King Abdullah also adopted the idea.
Two weeks ago, at the meeting in London and Syria, it was announced that the pilot project would be implemented this summer.
The third idea I want to show is a preference match between the state and the refugees In order to achieve this satisfying ending in this selfie Photo is German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask refugees what they want or they want to go there, but I advocate that we can do it and benefit everyone.
Economist Iven Ross created the concept of a paired market, that is, the order of preferences of both parties determines the final match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Erictz Tetboin study how to apply this concept to address refugee problems, and they ask refugees to rank the preferred country, but at the same time allow the country to rank the types of refugees they want to receive, based on skill or language standards.
Of course you need to build quotas in terms of diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way to increase the likelihood of pairing.
This pairing concept has been successfully applied, for example, to paired students and universities with matching kidney donors and patients It also highlights the importance of the rules of computing in dating sites.
So why not use it to give refugees a better choice?
This can also be applied at the national level, at this level, and the biggest problem we face is persuading local communities to accept refugees.
At present, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to remote areas to send farmers to cities.
So matching the market provides a potential way to match these preferences and reflect the needs and demands of the people of the host country and the refugees.
My fourth thought is a humanitarian visa.
Most of the tragedies and chaos we see in Europe are completely avoidable.
This stems from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy as follows: In order to seek refuge in Europe, you have to reach Europe on your own through a dangerous journey that I described before, but why these journeys are necessary
In an age when there are low-cost airlines and consulates?
These are completely unnecessary journeys last year, which led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people on European borders and within European borders.
If refugees can go directly to Europe and seek asylum, we can avoid these deaths, and that can be achieved through humanitarian visas which allow people to collect visas at embassies or consulates in neighboring countries and then pay for them by cruise ship or plane to reach Europe.
It costs about a thousand euros to take a stowaway from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It only costs 200 euros to fly from Bodrum in Turkey to Frankfurt, Germany.
If we allow them to do so, it will bring great results.
This would save lives, eradicate the market for illegal smuggling, eliminate the chaos we see on the edge of Europe, in areas like the Greek Islands.
The reason to stop us from implementing this solution is political, not rational solutions.
And this is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil first adopted this policy, and more than 2,000 Syrians were granted humanitarian visas to enter Brazil and obtain refugee status upon entry.
In that plan, every Syrian was granted refugee status and confirmed to be a real refugee.
There is also a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942 these Nansen passports were used as entry and exit documents to allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel across Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
Nansen International UNHCR Receives Nobel Peace Prize for This Viable Countermeasure
So the four ideas I showed you were all ways we could increase the Amira option.
Give refugees a better option, not just three basic, impossible options as I said before and still benefit everyone.
In general, we need a whole new perspective to increase the choice of refugees and recognize that they are not necessarily a burden to society.
Refugees are not a matter of cost.
It is true that refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they are also human beings with the skills, talent, and ambition to contribute to society – if we allow it.
Migration is not going away in a new world.
What we see in Europe will remain for many years.
People will still be uprooted, and we need to find a rational way to manage reality – not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid, not based on the logic of philanthropy, but on the opportunities presented by globalization, markets and liquidity.
I hope everyone realizes this, and I implore our government officials to meet this challenge.
Thank you all.
When I was a child, I always dreamed of the ocean.
It is colorful and vibrant, and there are many animals that look like alien creatures.
I’ve imagined the big sharks at the top of the food chain, and I’ve also fantasized about the sea turtle dancing gracefully among the coral reefs.
As a photographer who switched careers from marine biologists, I spent much of my career looking for places that appeared in my childhood fantasies.
As you can see, I’ve been taking risks in the water since I was a kid.
But the first time I actually dived into the water, it happened when I was 10 years old.
I can still remember clearly now that I was rowing water hard enough to get a rusty, a cannon lying on a coral reef.
In the end, I succeeded enough to get to the barrel, look up and find myself surrounded by fish, fish of all colors, like rainbows.
Since then, I have been deeply in love with the ocean.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve had the privilege of exploring the most beautiful oceanscapes on Earth for National Geographic and the Save Our Ocean Foundation.
My subjects are as big as giant sharks, small enough to move up the palms of your hands.
In the cold sea by the Canadian Bear Rainforest, I have encountered a humpback whale around me, and the smell of fish makes me forget.
In the Mozambique Channel, I saw the courtship ceremony of the green turtle.
Each of us will influence the ocean, and we will be affected by the ocean.
The pure ocean I dreamed of when I was a child is becoming more and more difficult to find.
Their scope is shrinking and they are increasingly threatened.
We humans have always occupied the top of the food chain on Earth, and I have seen and recorded these behaviors with my own camera.
For a long time, I thought that only shocking photos could wake up my audience.
Of course, this view is also good, that is to put me back to the beginning.
I believe that the best way to bring change is to spread love.
I feel like a bridge between man and animal, and as a photographer, I have a rare opportunity to uncover the mysteries of animals and ecosystems hidden in the depths of the ocean.
If you don’t know that something exists, how can you love it and protect it?
This is the strength of our environmental photographer.
I’ve been to hundreds of different seas, but there are only a few that really make me forget.
The first time I was struck by such a scene was almost a decade ago, on the rugged shores of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, countless sardines migrate north, which we call the “sardine tide.”
Believe me, these fish have to do it.
Because there are groups of hungry, agile hunters chasing behind.
For example, the dolphins that hunt collectively, they separate some of the sardines from the fish and gather them into balls.
Dolphins will drive these sardines closer to the sea and rush into the fish to enjoy this moving feast.
It was followed by a shark.
Most people will think that sharks and dolphins are natural enemies, but in the "sardine tide", they are co-existing.
In fact, with the help of dolphins, the sharks eat better.
Without dolphin drive-out, sardines are hard to gather into balls, and sharks often pass through the middle of the fish, just like through doughnuts, sometimes only drinking one belly water.
I had a couple of close encounters with sharks in the “sardine tide” and I understood that the sharks didn’t put me in the eye.
But I was still constantly bumped into, swept by the tail, like the other guests at this raucous feast.
We sailed east from the African coastline through the vast Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral reefs.
During the stormy southwestern monsoon season, the devilfish living in the sea of the islands gather near Baa Atoll, a small island called Hanifaro.
The swarms of shrimp crabs, most of which are smaller than our pupils, are the main food of the devil’s fish.
When these plankton are scattered, the devilfish generally prey alone, and they keep rolling backwards in the water, like a puppy chasing his tail.
And when the plankton gathered more and more, the devil fish began to connect, the platoon grew long eating formation, the head of the devil fish missed the delicious will be swallowed by the back of the companion.
As the plankton in the bay gather more and more, the formation of the devil fish is gathered, this unique method of predation, we call it the "whyndo predation method."
The devilfish are stacked, lining up in tight formations, forming a whirlpool, sucking plankton, and sending them straight into the devilfish's huge mouth.
Diving among the hundreds of devilfish, that scene will never be forgotten.
When I first went to Hanifaro to take a picture, it was not yet protected, and the ecological environment was threatened by local development.
In collaboration with non-governmental organizations such as the Devilfish Trust, my photographs eventually helped Hanifaro become a marine protected area.
Fishermen on nearby islands have hunted many devilfish and used their skins to make traditional drums.
Today, they are the most determined protectors of the Devilfish, which brings in more than $8 million a year to the Maldives.
I’ve always wanted to go back in time, back to the era when most of the map was still blank, or marked “There’s a dragon here.”
The most similar places I have ever been are some of the remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean .
There are far away from fishing grounds and fishing boats, where diving always makes me sad because it reminds me of what the ocean used to be.
Few people have heard of the Indian reef, which is a very small coral atoll located in the Mozambique Channel.
The reefs on its periphery form a protective barrier The lagoon in the middle becomes a kindergarten for the Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, even during the day.
I guess they'll be more lively at night, and they'll be more numerous.
I've never seen so many sharks in a coral lagoon before.
Record and share moments like this – remind me of the original intention of choosing this path.
Earlier this year, to complete a contract for National Geographic, I came to the California Peninsula.
In the middle of the peninsula, on the Pacific side, is located in the Alog of San Ignacio, an important breeding ground for gray whales.
Over the past 100 years, this stretch of coastline has been a huge slaughterhouse, where more than 20,000 gray whales have been killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
And now, the descendants of these gray whales will push their cubs to the sea, play and even interact with us.
The species has surprisingly recovered.
On the other side of the peninsula is Cape Pulmo, a quiet little fishing village.
Decades of overfishing once brought the village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the government to list the area as a marine protected area.
What happened next can be said to be a miracle.
In 2005, just 10 years after protection, scientists found that the number of local fish had recovered in record numbers.
See what you see, come with me.
Take a deep breath and dive into the bottom of the sea with me to see what the largest and densest fish I’ve ever encountered.
We all have the ability to create hope.
I want to pass on a message through my own photos that it's not too late to save the ocean from now on.
I want to pay particular attention to the resilience of nature, when it confronts 7.3 billion human beings.
I hope that in the future, it will be more and more difficult for me to take such photos, but to take more photos that reflect the harmonious coexistence of people and the sea.
I wish I could take pictures like this every day.
To make a name for ourselves in our business, you must be an incorrigible optimist.
I'm always taking pictures with such a hypothesis, the next great picture that can bring change is waiting for me in front, maybe behind the next coral reef, in the next lagoon, or else, just next.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, the issue of social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
Immediately after the new government emerged from the long war of independence, it announced a socialist policy: making health care and primary education a basic free project.
Large-scale rural health service centers that allow 80% of the population to reach within two hours of walking, which is a truly extraordinary progress
In 1980, 25% of children in Zimbabwe were routinely immunized.
By 1990, just a decade later, that percentage had risen to 80 percent.
It is a great honor for me to participate in this transformation, this revolution.
Excitement and comrade-in-allome love are very real.
Working shoulder-to-shoulder with prominent Zimbabwean people, scientists, doctors, activists I felt involved not only in an African independence movement but also in a progressive global public health movement
I also have some daunting difficulties.
In 1985, the year I arrived, Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS.
I took care of a few people with AIDS in the early 1980s when I was medically trained at Harlem Hospital, but... we had no idea what we would have encountered in Africa.
When I first got there, the infection rate was about 2%.
This percentage is rapidly increasing when I leave Harare 17 years later, one in four adults is infected.
By the mid-1990s I had told hundreds of energetic young people that they tested positive for HIV.
I saw my colleagues and friends die, and my students and hospital patients die.
In the face of this situation, I opened a clinic with my colleagues.
We show how to use condoms
We promote in school education and workplaces
We conduct research and we provide advice on how to protect our partners.
We worked very hard to do all of this, and I believe I did my best at the time.
I provided the best treatment, at least under the conditions of the time.
But I didn’t make a constructive change.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has confessed that his personal mistake led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the leader of the United Nations peacekeeping service.
At the Holocaust Decade of Remembrance, he recalled that I believed I had done everything I could, but after the Holocaust I realized that there was so much more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and seek support.
The AIDS outbreak has caught medical groups off guard against the World Health Organization's estimate that 39 million people today die from the disease, and many people feel remorse and regret because I haven't stopped it sooner.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't realize I was an advocate or a politician.
I thought it was because of my medical knowledge that I went there before because of my clinical and infectious disease studies.
I have always felt that my job is to care for patients and to better understand the demographic characteristics of infectious diseases through research, I hope to slow down the spread of the virus.
I realize that marginalized groups are infected and dying from AIDS, and the proportion of people who die from AIDS is surprisingly high.
In sugar plantations, this kind of place is more similar to feudal territory than in modern enterprises, 60% of pregnant women have tested positive for HIV.
My job is to show people that being infected is not about moral decay, but about patriarchal awareness and forced foreign labor and colonialism.
Most white people are safe.
As a medical expert, our approach is deplorable: imploring people to change their personal behavior using condoms and reducing the number of partners
The infection rate is still rising as our most effective weapon against the virus When treatment is already feasible in the West, treatment is unaffordable for the entire African public sector.
I didn't dare to say that inequality in access to life-saving medicines or the problems in the underlying economic and political system are the driving forces that have led to high infection rates among such a large population.
I made excuses for my silence, I reminded myself that I was just a visitor to this country, that the alarm could be deported so I couldn't do my job, to take care of my patients, to do much-needed research.
So I didn’t speak boldly about the government’s early AIDS policies.
I expressed my concern not loud enough.
Many doctors, health care workers, may feel like I’m not doing anything wrong.
Our commitment to the patient, like the Hippocratic Oath and its different versions, is a sacrosanct doctor-patient relationship.
I do everything I can for every patient.
But I know that infectious diseases that accompany the division of our society reflect not only biological phenomena but also marginalization, intolerance, racial discrimination, gender discrimination, class discrimination.
Such as AIDS.
This is true of the recent Ebola.
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Famar, who work on AIDS in Haiti, call it structural sexual violence: structural, because the political and economic organization of our social environment is rooted in the political and economic community that is often ignored by privilege and the political class; violence, because its effects such as premature death, suffering, disease, are violent.
We do very little for the sick, if we don't realize that these social injustices
The wake-up call is the first step in guiding public health care, which is the way we seek support, going through the fence together to create the way that really changes.
So now I am not silent.
I speak boldly about a lot of things, even though it makes the listener uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
And a lot of that is about segregation and organized racism, things that shouldn't happen in this country, things that shouldn't exist in medical practice or public health care.
But they do exist, and we pay the price for shortening our lives.
That's why racism in the United States is a wake-up call, and the ongoing organized, interpersonal violence against people of color is linked to our tragic history of slavery for 250 years of racial discrimination 90 years of racial discrimination 60 years of imperfect, unequal relationships That sound the alarm bell, and I'm at the center of my work as New York City's health commissioner.
In New York City, where premature deaths before the age of 65, blacks are 50 percent higher than whites.
In 2012, black women faced more than 10 times the risk of fertility-related death compared to white women.
Despite the tremendous progress we've made in reducing infant mortality, black babies are born, and the mortality rate is nearly three times that of white babies in the first year.
New York City is not a special case.
These statistics are similar across the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are about 15 million missing black men in the country.
The authors note that at least one in six black men between the ages of 25 and 54 has disappeared from their daily lives, either because of prison or premature death.
Young black people face disproportionate violence on a daily basis, which is very unfair, and these are all in the recent protests that hold up the slogan “Black lives matter.”
But we need to remember the current state and results in general medicine, and the persistent and oddly high rates of disease, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, diseases that slowly and quietly devour life, and cause more black lives to die prematurely.
As the “Black Lives Matter” movement unfolds, I feel frustrated and infuriating, medical groups are hesitant to use the word “racist” in research and work, even on the use of the word “racist.”
Every time I say it, you probably feel something.
Medical students in white robes to protest against biochemical weapons, but medical groups face the effects of persistent racial discrimination on disease conditions and mortality, largely stand by and watch.
I'm worried about drugs that tend to be personalized and accurate, to find biological and genetic goals, to better design therapies, may inadvertently prevent us from focusing on the big picture, and that's the scene of everyday life, growing up, working, loving, and importantly affecting group health For many of us, poor health
In everyday life, as health workers, whether in the clinic or while doing research, we are a huge and unjust witness: wanderers, unable to follow medical advice because he prioritizes more urgent things; young transgender people, planning suicide, because our society is too ruthless; single mothers are forced to feel responsible for the health of her children.
As health care workers, our role is not just to treat our patients, but to sound the alarm and advocate for change.
And, whether it's reasonable or not, our social jobs make our voices more credible, and we shouldn't waste it.
I regret not being able to speak out in Zimbabwe, and I've committed myself to being the New York City Health Commissioner, and I'm going to take advantage of all the opportunities I have to wake up for health care equality.
I will speak out against racism, and I hope you can join me, and I'll join you when you're sexist, or any kind of inequality, when you're against it.
It's time for us to rise up and fight against, to speak boldly about structural inequality.
For advocating for change, we don’t need to have all the answers.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, our own health, depends on this.
OK, I'd like to ask you to raise your hand and show how many people have ever blackened their friends on Facebook because they've made inappropriate remarks about politics, religion, children's rights, or food.
How many people have at least one person who doesn’t want to meet, because you just don’t want to talk to each other?
You know, in the past, if we wanted a polite conversation, we just had to follow Henry Higgins’ advice in My Fair Lady: Just talk about the weather and your health.
But these years have gone hand in hand with climate change and the anti-vaccine movement – and it doesn’t work.
So in the world we live in, this every conversation has the potential to develop into a world of argument, politicians can't talk to each other, and even for those who are garlicy things to have a crowd of people in favor or against, it's too abnormal.
The Pew Research Center conducted a survey of 10,000 American adults and found that our degree of polarization at the moment is more significant than at any time in history.
We are less inclined to compromise, which means we don’t listen to each other.
The various decisions we make, the choices of where to live, who we marry or even make friends with, are based only on the beliefs we already have.
Again, this means that we don’t listen to each other.
Conversation requires a balance of storytelling and listening, and somehow we’re losing that balance.
Technological progress is partly due to it.
For example, the smartphone is in your hands now, or is right next to it, and you can get it.
According to Pew’s research, about one-third of U.S. teens send more than 100 text messages a day.
And a lot of people, almost all of them, are more likely to text a friend than face-to-face conversations.
The Atlantic magazine has a great article.
The author is high school teacher Paul Barnwell.
He gave his students an exchange task,
I hope they teach them how to speak on a topic without taking notes.
Then he said, “I’m starting to realize...”
“I’m starting to realize that communication skills are probably the most overlooked, without the skills we’ve taught well.
Children spend hours a day on screens to reach out to creative and other partners, but rarely have the opportunity to discover their interpersonal skills.”
It sounds funny, but we have to ask ourselves: What skills are more important in the 21st century than maintaining a coherent, confident conversation?"
Now my profession is to talk to others, Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, governors, plumbers.
I talk to people I like and people I don’t like.
I talk to people who disagree very much on a personal level.
But I still have a good conversation with them.
So I hope to use the next 10 minutes to teach you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have heard countless suggestions, such as looking into each other’s eyes, thinking ahead of time about interesting topics that can be discussed, looking, noding and smiling to show your focus, repeating what you just heard, or summarizing.
I want you to forget all of this.
All useless.
There’s no need to learn how to show that you’re very focused, if you do.
I actually used the same skills as a career interviewer in my daily life.
Well, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually helping you learn how to be a better communicator.
Learn to start a conversation, not wasting time, not getting bored, and, most importantly, not offending anyone.
We all had great conversations.
We've all had it. We know how it feels.
The kind of conversation that ends makes you enjoy and inspire, or makes you feel like you’re making a real connection with someone else, or giving you complete understanding of others.
There's no reason to say that most of your human interactions can't be like that.
I have 10 basic rules. I'll explain it to you one article by one, but really, if you choose one and are proficient, you can already enjoy a more enjoyable conversation.
The first is to say, don’t be half-hearted.
I’m not saying just put down your phone, your tablet, your car keys, or whatever you hold in your hand.
I mean, in the moment.
Go into that situation.
Don’t think about your previous fight with your boss.
Don’t think about what you have for dinner.
If you want to quit talking, quit talking. But don't be in Cao Yingxin in Han.
The second is not to be a good teacher.
If you want to express your opinion, you don't want to leave any opportunity for people to respond, argue, refute, or blog.
There’s a good reason why I don’t allow “expert preaching” in my conversation: because it’s really boring.
If the other person is a conservative, it must hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If the other side is a liberal, it will hate big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
It is completely predictable.
You certainly don’t want that.
You need to assume that you can learn something when you enter every communication.
The famous therapist M. Scott Pike once said that true listening requires putting oneself aside.
Sometimes that means putting your personal point of view aside.
He said that feeling this acceptance, the speaker will become more and more invulnerable and sensitive, so it is more and more likely to open their inner world and present it to the listener.
Again, let’s say you need to learn something new.
Bill Ney said, "Every person you're going to see has something you don't know."
Let me repeat: everyone is an expert on some side.
The third point: the use of open-ended questions.
For this, please refer to the question method of the reporter's interview.
Start the question with “who”, “what”, “when”, “where”, “why” or “how”.
If you ask a complex question, you will get a simple answer.
If I asked you, “Are you afraid?”
You will respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, that is, “fear,” and the answer will be “yes” or “no.”
“Are you angry?”“Yes, I was angry.”
Let the other person describe the situation, the other is the person who knows the situation.
Try asking each other, “What does that look like?”
“How do you feel?”
Because in this way, the other person may need to stop and think about it, and you will get a more interesting answer.
The fourth point: let it go naturally.
That is, ideas flow naturally into your mind, and you need to express them.
We often hear the interview guests say a few minutes, and then the host comes back to ask questions, which seems to know where it came from or has been answered.
This shows that the host may not be listening to it two minutes ago, because he thought of this very witty question, so he thought about asking this question.
We will do the same thing.
When we were sitting and talking to someone, we suddenly remembered the chance encounter with Hugh Jackman at the coffee shop.
And then we stopped listening.
Stories and ideas will always come to you.
But even if it can't be stopped, don't let them linger too much in their minds.
Fifth, if you don’t know, say you don’t.
People on radio shows, especially on national public radio, know very well that their conversations will be played out, so they're more careful about where they claim to be professional and what they're saying.
Learn to do this. Be careful.
Conversations should be responsible.
Article 6: Do not compare your own experience with others.
If the other person talks about losing your family, don’t start talking about losing your family.
If the other person is talking about work troubles, don’t tell them how much you hate your job.
It’s different, it can never be the same.
Every experience is unique.
And, more importantly, it’s not about you.
You don't need to prove how capable you are at this moment, or how much pain you have endured.
When Stephen Hawking was asked what his IQ was, he replied, "I don't know. The people who cheat with intelligence are diaos."
Conversations are not meant to sell themselves.
Article 7: Try not to repeat your own words.
It's aggressive and boring, but we can do it easily.
Especially in a work conversation, or in a conversation with a child. We want to make a point, so we keep talking.
Don't do that.
Article 8: Less nonsense.
To put it bluntly, no one cares about those years, names, dates, and so on, the details of the things you try to think about in your head.
They don't care. They care about you.
The other person cares about what kind of person you are and what you have in common.
So forget the details. Never mind them.
Article 9: This is not the last one, but the most important one.
Listen carefully.
I can't tell you how many important people have said that listening is probably the most important thing, the first thing you can improve the skills.
Buddha said, I relayed, "If you keep talking, you won't learn anything."
Calvin Coolidge once said, “No one has ever been fired for listening too much.”
Why don’t we listen to each other?
First of all, we prefer to say.
I speak to everything in my control.
I don’t have to listen to anything that I’m not interested in.
I am the focus.
I can strengthen my sense of identity.
But there’s another reason: We’re going to be disturbed.
People say about 225 words per minute, but we can listen to nearly 500 words per minute.
So our brains are occupied by these 275 words.
I know it's very energy-intensive to really listen to people, but if you don't, you're not talking.
You are just two people in the same place, clamoring for each other without any connection.
You have to listen to each other.
Stephen Covey has a great deal about this.
He said: “Most of us don’t listen to it for the sake of understanding.
We listen to the response.”
The last article, article 10: Succinct.
“A good conversation is like a just-in-class miniskirt; short enough to be attractive, long enough to fit the subject—my sister’s metaphor” is all condensed into the same concept: to be interested in others.
I grew up next to a celebrity grandfather, and my guests in my family are endless.
Visitors would come and talk to my grandparents, and when the men left, my mother would come over and say to us, "Do you know who it is?
She is the runner-up of Miss America.
He is the mayor of Sacramento.
She won the Pulitzer Prize, a Russian ballet dancer.”
I'm growing up and I'm acquiescing that everyone has something that's not known.
Honestly, I think it was all that made me a better host.
I talk as little as possible, but open my mind, always ready to be surprised, and I will never be disappointed.
You can do that too.
Go out the door, talk to others, listen to others, and most importantly, be prepared to be surprised.
thanks.
Hello everyone.
My name is Matthew Williams and I'm a champion.
I've won medals in three different sports and the Canadian National Games, and I've been involved in international basketball and I'm very proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I have five days a week with top coaches and psychojob counselors to train basketball and speed skating to keep the best of the competition.
This is because of the special Olympics.
Has this made you a difference to me and to my achievements?
The world doesn’t see everyone like me as champions.
Not long ago, people like me were not seen.
Since the start of the special Olympic Games in 1968, this phenomenon has improved a lot, but in reality, it can often be seen that people with mental defects are often blind compared to ordinary people.
People call me “stupid” in front of me, thinking I’ll be fine.
They call me “fool” and say that my retardation is a completely derogatory use.
They don’t know how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don’t want you to feel like I’m here to have mercy.
I’m here because there’s a problem: There are a lot of people who think about intellectually deficient people that have problems, or, more, many people who don’t even approve of their existence.
You know the World Games are going to be this year, right?
I'm one of 6,500 mentally retarded athletes, and we're from 165 countries, competing in Los Angeles.
More than 62,000 viewers watched the opening ceremony and TSN and ESPN streamed the opening.
But do you know about this?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
I’m here today to be bold and take us as equals.
The special Olympics changed the self-awareness of intellectually deficient athletes and changed the view of the audience.
If you are not familiar with the special Olympic Games, let me explain that it was created for people with mental disabilities.
It is independent of the Paralympics and the Olympic Games.
We have high-quality, year-round sports for mentally handicapped players, which can change our fate and what we know about us.
The special Olympics changed my life and changed the lives of many people, and it changed the world's view of intellectually deficient people.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
Before I was 12 years old, I always played hockey.
The more I grow up, the more I feel like it's getting harder to keep up with other people, and I'm angry and frustrated.
For a while, I didn't get in touch with any sports, not many friends, I felt abandoned, no one cared.
For a time, people with intellectual disabilities were isolated by this society and not made public.
No one will feel that they can also participate in sports, let alone become a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of normal exercise on the health of children with intellectual disabilities.
Dr. Hayden, along with other researchers, came to the conclusion through rigorous scientific research that the reason for their declining health in children with intellectual disabilities is simply the lack of opportunities for exercise.
Many people question people with intellectual disability who can benefit from sports or athleticism.
But it's because of Dr. Hayden, and the founder of the special Olympics, Younis Kennedy Sharif, who insisted on the benefits of sports, and the special Olympic athletes proved that sports were beneficial no less than 4.5 million times.
I was a nervous person before I went to the special Olympics, because I was young and shy, I didn't have confidence, and I didn't have many friends.
But when I got there, I found everyone very friendly, helpful, non-discriminatory, and I made myself back.
Now, I'm a basketball player, and I'm a speed skater, I'm a provincial and national, and this year I'm at the Special Olympics in Los Angeles, where I represented the first Canadian basketball player.
I’m one of the 4.5 million athletes in the world, and I’ve heard a lot of similar stories.
Become an athlete at the special Olympics and help us regain our self-confidence and dignity
This event also points to important health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, mentally retarded men live 13 years less than men without intellectual impairments, while women with intellectually deficient live 20 years less than women without intellectual impairments.
The special Olympic Games keep us healthy, let us take the initiative to participate in the movement
Our Coaches also teach us about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics also offers free health check-ups for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctors or athletes who have difficulty getting health attention.
At the 2015 Special Olympics Summer Olympics, the players of my Canadian team and I fought against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, Nigerian basketball team members participated in the health system of the Games, 7 of the 10 players got free hearing aids, and heard more clearly for the first time in their lives.
The changes that have brought them are amazing.
They are more excited, happy, confident because their coach can finally communicate with them in words.
They're very excited because they can hear the sound of basketball, the whistle, and the cheers of the fans standing next to them, the voices that we think should be there.
Special Olympics not only changes athletes in terms of sports
It also changes the lives of athletes.
This year, research showed that nearly half of adults in the U.S. have a significantly more intolerant, less positive attitude about an intellectually deficient person who doesn’t know a 44 percent of Americans who don’t have contact with someone with an intellectual disability.
And then the word "stupid" proves that people with intellectual disability are still blind and feel isolated.
People use the word, either casually say it or scold.
Last year on Twitter, it was used more than 9 million times, which deeply hurt me and the 4.5 million athletes in the world.
People don't think it's swearing, but it's true.
My fellow athlete and global messenger Franklin Stephens wrote a letter to a political commentator who used to swear in the word "stupid", "Look for a day to see the special Olympics,
See if your thinking remains unchanged when you leave."
This year, at the 2015 Special Olympics Summer Olympics, people lined up for hours to watch the last night of weightlifting.
When my teammate Jackie Barrett played, people stood up, and he was called the Newfoundland moose, who pulled up 665 pounds and squatted up and raised 611 pounds to pass a number of new records for the special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder among weightlifters in Newfoundland, not just for the special Olympics, but for all weightlifters.
Jackie is now a big star in Los Angeles, and ESPN has also tweeted that he broke his weightlifting record and was shocked by his performance.
Fifty years ago, almost no one could have imagined that people with intellectual disabilities could do that.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Stadium, watched the opening ceremony of the competition, and cheered for athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We are congratulated and cheered, and no longer hidden.
Special Olympics Church athletes are more confident and proud of themselves
The special Olympics also taught the world that people with intellectual disabilities also deserve to be respected and included.
Now, I have dreams and achievements in my sports career, good training, respect, life is healthier, and then I'm trying to move on to the career of a personal trainer.
I'm not hiding, I'm being bullied, I'm doing TED Talk here
With the special Olympics, the world has become different, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you see people with intellectual disabilities again, I hope you can see their potential.
The next time someone uses the word “stupid” around you, I hope you tell them that it hurts so much.
I hope you will see a special Olympics.
I finally want to share an idea with you.
Nelson Mandela said, “Sport has the ability to change the world.”
The special Olympics are changing the world, changing 4.5 million athletes, giving us a place, making us confident, getting friends, not being discriminated against, and experiencing being a champion.
Thank you all!
You may have never heard of Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
But I think they are the two best places in the world.
The hospital there, with a community of nurses, surgeons and scientists, has been silently fighting one of humanity’s deadliest threats, the Lhasa virus, for years.
Lhasa virus is very similar to Ebola.
It can cause severe fever symptoms and is often fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day to protect every member of the community, and at the same time, to protect us all.
The best thing I learned from them was that when I first visited many years ago, when the challenging, front-line days started every morning – singing.
They gather together to show their joy.
They show a spirit.
Many years have passed, and when we visit each other year after year, I can come together and sing with them, and we record these, and we love to do so, because it reminds us that we are not just looking for scientific truth together, but also a human bond that binds us together.
And you can imagine that when things change around you, that connection becomes extremely important, even indispensable.
In March 2014, a huge change occurred, with the Ebola outbreak in Guinea.
It was the first outbreak in West Africa, at the border between Sierra Leone and Libya.
The situation was terrible and we were all shocked.
In fact, we even once suspected that Lhasa and the Ebola epidemic were spread more broadly than we thought, and we feared that one day it would spread to Kenema.
So my team members immediately set out, rushed there, joined Dr. Humar Khan and his team, and we built up diagnostic equipment to do some sensitive molecular testing, and when Ebola crossed the Sierra Leone border, we could detect it.
We've already set up a device of this size for Lhasa virus, and we know how to deal with it, and the team is fantastic.
We just need to give them equipment and venues to study Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the delivery room in the hospital, and our team conducted those important molecular tests and confirmed the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This is actually very great.
They can diagnose the condition in the first place, safely treat patients, and start tracking contacts and follow up on the spread of the condition.
It could have stopped something.
But when that day came, the outbreak had been brewing for months.
After the discovery of hundreds of cases, it dwarfs all previous outbreaks.
And the virus is not driven into Sierra Leone by that single case, it's a huge shock wave.
We had to work closely with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, and Kenema, to deal with these cases. The next week 31 patients, then 92, and then 147 – all flocked to Kenema, because this is one of the few places in Sierra Leone that can cope with the epidemic.
We work hard day and night, we want to help every patient, we want to get everyone's attention, but we also do another simple thing.
To detect Ebola, we took samples from the patient’s blood, and of course we could throw them away.
But in fact, the other thing we can do is add chemicals to the sample to inactivate it, and then seal it in a box and transport it across the ocean. And that's what we did.
We sent samples to Boston, where my team worked,
We worked in shifts day and night, and we quickly put together 99 genomes of Ebola.
This is the blueprint – the genome of the virus is a blueprint.
We have it in humans too.
It details everything that makes up our bodies and tells us a lot of information.
The results of these works are simple, but also strong.
We can take these 99 different virus variants, observe and compare them, we can clearly see that compared to the three genomes released by the Guinean side, we can find that the disease has begun to spread in Guinea a few months ago, and once you break into the population, it will be transmitted rapidly through human contact.
This information is actually crucial, especially when you're looking at how to hinder the spread of the virus, but the most important thing is contact tracing.
We can also see that when the virus is spreading from person to person, it is also constantly mutating.
Every variation is extremely important, because all the diagnoses, vaccines, and treatments we use are basically based on that particular genome sequence, which is the root cause of the spread of the epidemic.
So the world's health experts need to respond quickly, to improve the research method, to adjust everything they do.
But as far as I was at the time, the way of scientific research was that I got the data, and I might have to be in the lab for months, analyze the data carefully, write the paper, put it out, make repeated changes, and finally the paper is public, and the data can be made public.
This is the current state of scientific research at that time.
Well, at that particular time this approach certainly doesn't work, right?
Some of our friends work on the front line of disease resistance, and obviously what we need most is outside help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did, the gene sequencing results came out of the machine, and we immediately released the data online.
We open up to the world and say, “Help us!”
Then help to follow.
We didn’t react, and a large group of people around the world took the initiative to contact us, and they were surprised to see that the data was made public online.
Some of the best virus trackers in the world suddenly became part of our team!
We work together in this virtual way, we share information, we talk to each other, we keep in touch all the time, we want to be able to track the spread of the virus every second, and then find a way to contain it.
In fact, there are many ways we want to form such a group.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic is outbreak around the world, is constantly getting information, and they are participating and getting involved.
Everyone wants to make some contributions.
The power of all people in the world is really amazing, and the Internet binds us together.
We’re no longer afraid to communicate with others, and all of us say, “Start work.”
Let’s work together, we can do it!”
But the problem is that the data we all use, the data we find on Google, is far from meeting the needs of our work.
When that happens, we miss a lot of opportunities.
So in the early days of the Kenema outbreak, we had 106 clinical records of patients, and we once again made them public.
In our own lab, you give us the 106 records, and we can get the computer to predict the next Ebola patient, with nearly 100 percent accuracy.
We also made an app that specializes in publishing these predictions so that health workers around the world have access to this information.
But 106 reports are far from enough to make this approach work.
So we're waiting for more clinical reports to release that software,
These reports never came.
We're still waiting, we're constantly revising the software, in the lab, not working with you.
This is...we can’t accept it at all.
You, you, all of you can’t accept it.
Now is the time for life to hang.
In fact, a lot of people have died, and a lot of people working in the medical field, including my beloved colleagues, have five colleagues: Mbaru Vonny, Alex Mubi, Dr. Humal Khan, Alice Kowma, and Mohammed Fuller.
These are just five of the thousands of health workers who have died elsewhere in Kenema, while the world has been waiting, and we have been working, and people are independent and have no communication.
The Ebola virus, like all other threats to humanity, is exacerbated by distrust, dispersion and estrangement between people.
When we build barriers to each other and fight each other, the anger of the virus is even more arrogant.
But Ebola is not like any other threat, because this time, we became a family.
We are all on the same front.
If a person has Ebola, we may be next.
So we live in the world, we have common weaknesses, common strengths, common fears, common hopes, and I sincerely hope that we can work together with joy.
One of my graduate students read a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered the word “Kanema,” the city we worked in Sierra Leone, the name of the hospital, which means “as transparent and clear as a river, and everyone’s eyes are accessible.”
It has a very far-reaching meaning for us, we don't realize it ourselves, but we always feel that in order to pay tribute to Kenema, to all the people we've fought for, we have to be open and cooperative, we have to share information, we have to work together.
We have to do that.
Everyone should demand that we and others – and when disaster strikes, we should all open our hearts to each other and fight this battle together.
Because this is not the first Ebola outbreak, and it won't be the last, there are many other microbes in the world that have been lurking around us, like the Lhasa virus and other organisms.
The next time a disaster occurs, it could happen in a city of millions of people, and it could explode there.
The virus may spread through the air.
The virus can even be deliberately spread.
I know it's scary, I can understand it, but I also know that this experience tells us that we have enough technology and the ability to win this battle, not only to win this battle, but to all the viruses.
But we can only do it when we work together, and we have to be happy.
So for Dr. Khan, and for all those who have died on the front lines of the disease, those who will always fight with us, let us fight with them forever.
Our world should not be defined by the devastation caused by a single virus, and we want to make billions of hearts and minds shine through the earth.
Thank you all.
