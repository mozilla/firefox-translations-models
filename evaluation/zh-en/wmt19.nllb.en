According to British media, William Moran, Deputy Secretary of the Navy for Operations, will say that even as the U.S. Navy is rebuilding its strength to meet growing concerns from Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to focus on the Asia-Pacific region ― the Pentagon expanding its reach to include the Indian Ocean, Asia-Pacific ― as the Navy's focus.
According to the September 24 report on the website of the British Defence Weekly, the United States has ranked China as a strategic competitor in the new defense strategy announced earlier this year.
After that, the U.S. Navy restored the Second Fleet to allow for more direct action against Russia.
These moves have raised some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts, who fear the U.S. Navy may move away from the Obama administration's strategy of rebalancing the Asia-Pacific.
But General Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus remains on the western Pacific.
On January 24, 2018, at the roundtable discussion on the public-sea challenge organized by the National Bureau of Asian Studies in Washington, D.C., he said: "For us, there has been no significant change".
Moran says:  The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting the focus, or whatever you want to describe it.
He admitted, however, that the United States had close ties to Europe.
He said:  We will continue to monitor the growth of the West Coast, and balance what we can do.
While Moran pointed out that the overall policy regarding Russia falls within the purview of the U.S. Secretary of Defense, he warned:   Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has proven that if we clash with them, they will be very tough                                                                    
General Moran said that as part of the U.S. resumption of operations against Russia, China and other competitors in Eastern Europe, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying troops in a new mode of operation, which will help prevent the enemy from overcoming American aircraft carriers or other assets at any given time and place.
He said:  Our Navy and Marines support it ― ― ― create the concept of unpredictability, never repeatedly appearing in the same place, almost like a stake ― ― this is our practice. ― 
The earliest attempts to this new approach were made by the Jharri Durmen aircraft carrier, the first deployment of which included working visits to the port and patrols in areas normally only passed by.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is currently working to ensure that its allies know that these warships will continue to patrol the traditional region, and is also working to address logistics and home connectivity issues for new deployment procedures.
Michael Nunnant, Commander of the Royal Australian Navy, will also address the event, saying that the Australian military can cooperate with the US carrier fighter group without any problems.
He said that this situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to repurchases nine frigates equipped with the Zeus combat system.
Starting October 5, many airlines will increase or restore fuel surcharges to increase the cost of flights starting next Friday.
Yesterday, foreign airlines such as Ojai Airways announced that, from October 5, 2018, domestic flights will be charged a fuel surcharge of 800 kilometres ($20 USD) per passenger and flights over 800 kilometres ($30 USD) per passenger.

Japanese businessman Ito忠 Business Friday identified a $1.3 billion impairment loss on its investment in China's China Shenzhen stock, which was cut short by its largest corporate investment transaction, due to the impact of trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked past the headquarters of丸zh红株式会社.
丸红 said the U.S. grain sector, which is hit by the trade war, has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Previously, some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies, and others, when announcing their latest results, had issued warnings about the impact of the China-US trade friction, but now these Japanese trading companies are also joining the ranks.
The United States and China are imposing tariffs on each other on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods, U.S. President Trump has threatened to expand the scope of tariffs to all Chinese-American goods worth more than $50 billion if the dispute is not resolved.
Isuzu Tsuyoshi Hachimura, chief financial officer of commercial and industrial relations, said the trade dispute next year may have a greater impact on China's economy.
Ito-Tosh Business and the Thai Crop Bees Group invested $10 billion in China in 2015, acquiring 20% of its shares.
Hachimura said that the Izhito-Tosh business lost a loss of $1.3 billion in this segment of its holdings, considering that the price of the shares would not recover in the near future.
The Itou-Tōh business maintained its profit forecast for the financial year ending March 31, 2019 at 50 billion yen.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on US soybeans in July, as a move to counter the Chinese government's trade friction.
"Our grain business has been hit by the US-China trade friction", said Finance Minister Yae Minhan.

November 5th, 2019  General Report, the midterm election vote in the United States has entered countdown time.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively mourned their core voters.
Both parties have pointed out that voter turnout will be key to the left-wing electoral landscape.
Reportedly, 48 hours before the US referendum, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidate's rally, while former President Obama traveled to Indiana, stood for the Democratic candidate for the federal Senate, Joe Donnelly, and shouted to the crowd for a final appeal before the election.
On November 4, Trump was on his way to Georgia's May station for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, saying: "Tuesday you have to go to the polls, you have to vote".
 The contrast between this election cannot be more precise 
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, with early voting in some states becoming far more common.
When the first-ever U.S. president faces a midterm election, the seats of the members of Congress of his party are often reduced.
A new poll released on Wednesday by the Washington Post and ABC News shows that while the Democratic Party's Federal House of Representatives election situation remains a foregone conclusion, Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and Trump's strong focus on border security.
Polls showed that registered voters prefer Democratic House of Representatives candidates to Republicans, a 50% to 43% share, but the 14 percentage points of lead in August is still down.
Another poll conducted by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead Republicans by seven percentage points.
Reportedly, Obama told the crowd at the time of Senator Donnelly's inauguration: "When people don't speak the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there are inevitable consequences".
When people can only lie and self-abandoningly, democracy will not work.
The only way to stop these Republicans from acting right now is for you and your vote.
The Democratic Party faces the toughest election in decades in the Senate, with the Republican Party currently holding more than half of the 51 seats.
But the House of Representatives is more favorable, and the Democrats need to win 23 seats again to take control of the 435-seat House.
According to analysts at the forecast election site FiveThirtyEight.com, the chances of a Democratic winner of the House of Representatives are as high as 85%.

Under the current wave of mass-market start-ups, mass-market innovation, more and more tech companies are starting to put emphasis on patent research and development and related protection work, dig deep into the potential value of patents, and take over market dominance.
Similarly, many tech companies have also encountered a wave of infringements in terms of patent licensing, patent use, and so on.
At the end of 2017, three people from Guangdong Province, including Zhongwei, Zhongzhong, Rai, and Liang, filed a patent infringement suit against the developer of the App, Beijing Xiaoxing Technology Limited (later known as Xiaoxing Technology Limited), the operator, and the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Limited (later known as Guangdong Pacific), in the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The complainant requested a court order, and the three defendants immediately ceased to manufacture, sell, promise to sell, and use the complainant's patent practices.
On October 30, 2018, the Chinese Arbitral Documentation Network published a first civil judgment on patent disputes between the Chinese arbitrator and Beijing Small Technology Co., Ltd. in which it disclosed details of some of the patent infringement cases filed against the DIDITI APP.
The plaintiff argues that the entire operation of the mobile device-based service system and method of patenting and inventors, while the entire operation of the application of the DIDITY EXPORT application and the technical program for patent protection involved, constitute patent infringement.
However, during the court's periodic hearing, Xia科技 held that Guangdong Pacific was not a qualified defendant, that it only offered free downloads of the relevant APP on the Internet, did not implement the patented method of the case, did not have direct or indirect infringement, and should not be listed as a defendant in this case.
Second, the infringement was not committed in Guangdong.
Under the law, infringement of the patent in question should be fully implemented in the place where the patent procedure in question is being applied, and therefore the court's jurisdiction was challenged, requesting that the case be transferred to the defendant's local court of residence, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
 The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the allegedly infringing APP products on its network platform, and that it was not appropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant as defendant in Guangdong Pacific.
 and the defendant's home in Guangzhou Pacific, within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant claims to have transferred the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for consideration, based on insufficiency, dismissed the defendant's objection to the jurisdiction of the defendant and to bear the costs of the case.
Other proceedings in the case are not yet disclosed, and journalists will pay close attention to the details of the patent infringement case.
 Interview with the CEO of the Australian Federal Organisation for Scientific and Industrial Research: The results of the cooperation in science and technology in Australia are remarkable.
 China's scientific and technological development has been rapid over the past few decades, and the two countries have worked together in science and technology to achieve great results.
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Australian Federal Organisation for Scientific and Industrial Research, said in an interview with China News Agency in Beijing that from climate change to the collaboration of the Tanakh project, Australia's cooperation in the field of technology is showing a vibrant momentum.
As the largest national research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO's achievements in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and more are recognized worldwide for their innovative research.
CSIRO has always maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
 This is a long-lasting friendship, which includes a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation between partners.Marshall said
In May of this year, China's 500-meter-tall globular radiation telescope ― ― zh China's telescope ― was installed internationally as the first stage19 wavebeam L-wave receiver ―.
This is currently the most advanced 19 wave-beam receiver in the world, developed jointly by Chinese-Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver was based on the technological accumulation of CSIRO over many years, after the FAST orbiter speed will be increased five to six times, while also expanding further scientific observation targets.
 This is a force of CSIRO's contribution to FAST 
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO also works closely with Chinese scientific institutions in the construction of square kilometre array radiotelescopes, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy saving and emission reduction, and so on.
 Previous scientific research has often focused on issues centuries later, but more research is needed today to solve the problems ahead zh
Marshall believes that both countries complement each other in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a range of challenges in developing countries.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequently around the world, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production, food shortages have severely affected human development.
At the same time, the problems of population explosion, ageing, chronic diseases are also the major challenges facing us today.
The cooperation between the two countries in recent years has been mainly focused on solving these current problems.
Marshall said,CSIRO is a collaboration of the National Laboratory of Ocean Science and Technology of Aquarius, the International Centre for the Study of the Southern Hemisphere's Oceans, whose work focuses on observing the El Niño and Ladina phenomena, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing extreme weather forecasting facilities;CSIRO and the Institute of Microbiology have developed a new variety of grain to overcome extreme weather, which can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
 In today's environment, technological innovation is difficult to accomplish alone, requires extremely high costs, and has many problems to be solved, so cooperation is especially important today 
Marshall said that the closer cooperation is, the more likely it is to make breakthrough progress, which is also what it means for both sides to strengthen cooperation within the framework of the Zhongshan Road.
 Strengthen bilateral cooperation, for us mainly in the field of technology 
For example, Marshall said,CSIRO's latest research has developed a method of gold purification that does not use hydrogen peroxide, and since traditional hydrogen peroxide gold purification methods are very harmful to the environment, many countries are hoping to find a method of gold purification that is less polluting to the environment.
 We are eager to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our cooperation with China.zh
A conference on the cooperation of the project was held in the city of Urumqi, Xinjiang, on 29th, 2018, with the guests of the conference appreciating the developmental achievements of the city, as well as the local cuisine, and the rich history and culture of the region.

It will be able to revive, release, and re-energize the old industrial base, touching the heart of the Secretary-General.
North Korean Foreign Minister Li Yongzhong told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen North Korea's distrust of the United States, and that it would be impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Li Yong-yeon told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken a very friendly approach over the past year, including halting missile and nuclear testing, demolishing a nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
But we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States, he said.
If we do not trust the United States, we do not trust our national security, and in such a situation, we cannot unilaterally abandon our weapons first.
While Lee Yong-yeon repeatedly complained about North Korea's opposition to nuclear de-nuclearization by the United States, his speech was significant because there was no unilateral, complete denial of nuclear de-nuclearization like North Korea's previous efforts.
Li Yong-yeon mentioned a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to the efforts to de-nuclearize the North Korean peninsula, while Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said North Korea must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
The United States also refused to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
 The United States insisted on going nuclear , and increased sanctions pressure, to achieve its goal in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to issue the declaration of war-ending , 李勇 said.
The idea that sanctions can make us kneel down and beg forgiveness is that those who don't understand us are dreaming of the day.
But the problem is that these continued sanctions deepen our distrust.
Li Yongzhong did not mention the plans for the second delegation meeting, which the US president mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he stressed Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Wen Jia-chang's three meetings in the past five months, saying:  If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea instead of North Korea, then the denuclearization of the North Korean peninsula will not become so 
China has announced, since November 1, 2018, that it has reduced import duties on 1585 tax purposes.
Since this year, China has steadily reduced import duties.
From May 1 of this year, the total tariff reduction on medicines, including all common drugs, including anticancer drugs, and biocidal products with anticancer effects, will be adjusted to zero for a total of 28 import duties, including Chinese pharmaceuticals with actual imports.
At the same time, the VAT burden on the production of anti-cancer drugs and imports has been significantly reduced.
July 1st, the tax cuts on 218 taxable vehicles and parts.
After the tax cuts, China's automobile repair tax rate is now lower than the average in developing countries, in line with China's automotive industry practice.
This tax cut will promote structural adjustment and resource optimization, accelerate the win-win situation, help improve the quality of products and services, and hopefully drive the price adjustment of cars to some extent, giving consumers more incentives.
July 1st, the tax cuts on 1449 tax purposes for everyday consumer goods.
The tax cuts on everyday consumer goods are closely related to the need for people to live a better life.
This tax cut is not only large in number but also powerful, with an average tax cut of 56%.
Lowering taxes on everyday consumer goods, directly benefiting the wider consumer base, and promoting domestic industry to improve competitiveness.
On November 1, the tax reduction will be implemented on 1585 taxable industrial goods such as mechanical and electrical equipment, parts and raw materials.
 Appropriately lowering import tariffs on some domestically needed industrial goods, attracting more foreign investment, increasing domestic supply, facilitating industrial upgrades, while helping businesses allocate resources globally, reducing production costs, and reducing domestic environmental stress.
The introduction of the relevant officials of the State Council's Customs and Excise Committee, the above four autonomous tax cuts, and the third step of the tax cuts implemented on July 1 of this year under the scope of the agreement to expand the scope of the IT agreement, will bring the total level of Chinese tariffs down from 9.8% last year to 7.5% 
The adjusted overall level of tariffs is slightly higher than the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a medium to low level, and basically matches the status and development stage of China's developing countries.
The overall level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in China's goods trade, should be adapted to the stage of China's economic development, reflecting the characteristics of the times.
China, the world's first goods trade in terms of volume, already has an open economic base for further expansion, but the quality and benefits of trade development are still at a disadvantage compared to developed economies, and therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be reduced appropriately.
Tariffs are a means of protecting compliance, the level of tariffs should be in line with the competitiveness of industry, to encourage good competition, to overprotect against industrial development and to improve quality.
The tariff rate is adjusted to meet production needs and consumption needs.
Focus on lowering the domestic demand for large goods, the rate of goods tax that helps to upgrade the industrial transformation, efforts to increase the demand of the masses, the import of products with concentrated characteristics, the increasing awareness of businesses and the public, the need to meet the upgrades of industrial structures and consumption structures.
The tax cuts should take into account the affordability of financial revenues and industrial development.
When it comes to choosing specific goods and the amount of taxation to be reduced, it is necessary to coordinate and coordinate the two domestic and foreign markets, the upstream and downstream aspects, the production and consumption relationships, and maintain China's economic growth momentum.
The person in charge emphasized that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, China's proactive reduction of the total level of import tariffs is a major initiative taken by China itself to meet its own needs for high-quality development, to facilitate the pooling of international and foreign resources, to promote the improvement of the quality of domestic supply systems, to meet the needs of the people's consumer upgrading needs.
This action and initiative shows that China will firmly adhere to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of openness, strongly support economic globalization, firmly uphold the principles of free trade and the multilateral trade system at the heart of the WTO, continue to draw on the development momentum of openness to the world, and also allow China's development to benefit the world better.
Serbia has declared itself in the highest state of readiness.The President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
According to a report from the Office of the President of Serbia, given that Kosovo forces have occupied the channel to the reservoir of the Gazzivoda hydroelectric power station, which is controlled by Belgrade in northern Kosovo, Serbian President Vučić has ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest state of warfare.
On September 29, Serbian Defense Minister Wozhurin declared that the Serbian army had entered a state of complete readiness.
Wulin stressed that as long as the order issued by Vucic remains in force, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and no matter where things may turn, the Serbian army will respond.
According to Russian news agency TASS, on September 29, Wozhchic said in an interview that he had informed the current situation with the other parties, including Russia and Europe, and that he would travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support as much as Syria, Vucic replied: "I do not want a major military conflict to occur on our territory".
Wuchichi also said that the Serbs entered a state of complete military readiness only to form a deterrent to the conflict, but this was also a clear warning: no violence in Kosovo will be tolerated.
The Serbian cause of the improvement of the state of readiness is related to two major moves in Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, the Albanian people have been making massive arrests of Serb ethnicity in the northern region of Kosovo, where the Serbs who were arrested did not violate any law.
Vucic said that since the Serbian government's Kosovo and Metohija office chief Marco Yuric was beaten and detained by the Kosovo army on March 26 this year, the Ars have been steadily escalating regional situations, inhumane arrests and deportations of Serbs.
Moreover, more than 100 people, including the recently self-declared Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo's ROSU special forces, armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station reservoir, entered the ecological and sports center near the northern embankment of the Kosovo region, and blocked all nearby roads, which were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic noted that this military adventure by Kosovo, carried out under the auspices of Western countries, the actions of the Kosovo army did not inform the Serbian side in advance, violated the Brussels Convention, Chapter 9, Paragraph 1, and violated UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the Military Technical Agreement between the Secos.
Wuchichi has already addressed NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg, criticizing Western countries for their hypocrisy on Kosovo.
The root of the conflict today is still centuries-old historical grievances between the Saiyan tribes in Kosovo.
There are various opinions about Kosovo's belonging, Serbs and Arz ethnic groups.
Serbia considers Kosovo to be the birthplace and cultural cradle of the nation, since Serbia established its most powerful state here in the 12th century, while the Arabs only migrated in large numbers to the north after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbs were defeated.
The Azh people maintain that the original Illyrian tribe that lived in Kosovo in the 4th-5th centuries BC were the ancestors of the Azh people, and therefore Kosovo has been the territory of the Ahrans since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have led to intense clashes between different ethnic, religious and cultural groups, and to a fierce confrontation between Serbs and Arz ethnic groups in Kosovo.
In 1912, the Kosovo Azh people were the first to declare Albania's independence.
After World War I, large numbers of Aryan settlers in the Balkan Peninsula migrated to Turkey, the proportion of Serbs increased relatively, the Serbs saw only the practice of taking back their own land, but the Aryan people saw it as the plunder of Greater Serbianism, fueling the ethnic contradictions.
Kosovo has become a barrel of Balkan drugs.
In 1999, Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army clashed with Serbian army and police, leading NATO forces to bomb the southern coalition of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Kosovo War broke out.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Although there have been rumors that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, due to historical national grievances and geopolitical tensions, a multilateral agreement with the United States, Europe and Russia has not been able to sign.
A month earlier, Vucic first made a clear call for the separation of Serbs and Ars within Kosovo, once again exposing the contradictions between the two ethnic groups.
 Electricity communication is still disrupted  Heavy rescue difficulties in Indonesia are heavy with the tsunami accompanied by severe earthquakes
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency on the morning of 30 June, a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck on 28 June in Zhegala County, Sulawesi Province, have killed 420 people.
WilemRampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, said that the figure was only a preliminary estimate of the city of Palou, the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, about 80 kilometers from the quake's epicenter, due to the lack of large search engines, and the fact that many hotels, shops, warehouses and other densely populated buildings in the city were destroyed by the earthquake.
Local time September 29, 2018, Indonesia's Bazhru, a bridge destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami, collapsed several times.
Due to severe damage to power and communications facilities, the quake affected Zhegala County and the neighboring Sigi region, which remained unconnected to the island, it is impossible to count the number of casualties.
According to media reports, the Indonesian vice president, Karaj, said the death toll was as high as thousands.
Power outages, communications outages, road blocks, airport damage... heavy rescue efforts after a major earthquake and tsunami have been difficult.
Due to power outages, some hospitals and rescue facilities in the city of Pallu need to be powered by fuel.
The road to the city's entrance and exit is blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles, including petrol cars, cannot access it, making the fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Social Minister Agust Az said that due to road damage, emergency relief supplies such as tents, beds, blankets, clothing, food, household items, and other items that the ministry had transported from the neighbouring provinces of South Sulawesi and Colombo to the earthquake zone had not yet arrived in the disaster area.
Emergency materials being transported from the capital Jakarta are being flown to the disaster area via air transport aircraft.
Given that the command tower and runway at Palou Airport were damaged in the earthquake, all commercial flights have been suspended, except for military aircraft carrying rescue supplies and personnel.
Indonesian Minister of Political, Legal and Security Affairs, Viranto, who is in charge of the earthquake relief in the region, demanded that the power supply and commercial flight service at the airport be restored as soon as possible to ensure that rescue facilities such as hospitals are operational, that more rescue workers and volunteers can be transported to the disaster area.
On 28th, a series of strong earthquakes occurred in the province of Sulawesi, Indonesia, including a magnitude 7.7 earthquake at 17.02 local time, which caused tsunami, causing major disasters in the city of Paluu, the province of Sulawesi, and the region of Sigizh.
China News Agency Beijing October 1st, 2017 (Reporter) 空如洗zh晴空万里...... Recently, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model, attracting millions of Beijing citizens to flower shows on social platforms, to a constant blissful display of happiness, calling it the blue sky, the American sky, this is the best Beijing movie  .
Since August, Beijing has hosted some of the most blue skies in the world.
Within the city of Jinjiang, people can be seen anywhere, anytime, or with a smartphone or a camera camera camera.
On social platforms like Weibo, Weibo, and other social media platforms, you can see the palaces, the Tian'an Gate, the bird's nest, the holes in the cameras of the netizens everywhere, and all kinds of buildings display different beauty under the blue sky.
Some netizens say that such a film is the best urban propaganda film in Beijing; others say that if such a blue sky is long-term brush screen, people with spinal cord disease can be cured; and others hope that this blue color will be more effective in winter and spring and summer, making the roofs of Beijing city four seasons blue.
Why do people in Beijing love the blue sky so much?
Just because the people who lived in this city in the past suffered from fog, they especially longed for blue skies, while Beijing's Blue Sky Defense War was raging, and after continuous improvements in air quality, fog has decreased, blue skies have increased, people are looking at the eyes and minds, and happiness is also a huge part of the experience.
On the day of the National Day of the People's Republic of China, Beijing has a nice weather.
By 8 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations in the city were showing green as a "Y" grade.
A photo contest on social media platforms with the theme of "The Blue Sky" by the public is still ongoing.
Why is the sky in recent Beijing so blue?
According to the official of the Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, in August this year, Beijing's average concentration of PM2.5 particles (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms/cubic meter, setting the best record in almost five years.
The PM2.5 real-time rate in September was much higher than the current frequency.
A major factor in the emergence of the most blue skies is the overall favorable weather conditions over recent periods, and more importantly, Beijing's continued efforts to manage air pollution, the recent five years of strong air cleanliness action plans, the continued release of environmental benefits, and the reduction of total regional pollutant emissions, all of which laid the foundation for a continuous improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented its Clean Air Action Plan for Beijing City 2013-2017 in 2013.
Under the plan, officials will continue to lead non-capital functional evacuation, promote energy cleanup alternatives and pollution reduction efforts, and eliminate a total of 4,923 coal-fired furnaces.
Beijing thus became the first major city in mainland China to achieve full network natural gas conversion.
Data shows that between 2013 and 2017, Beijing's annual average PM2.5 decreased by 35.6%; the number of days of air quality metrics increased by 50 days; the number of first-grade positive days increased by 25 days; the number of days of heavy pollution decreased by 35 days, and the incidence of heavy pollution significantly decreased.
While continuing to improve air quality, Beijing's official announcement, based on a new round of PM2.5 source analysis, was made in September this year, which released the Beijing City-Win-Blue Sky Defense Three-Year Action Plan, focusing on the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, focusing on the areas of prevention such as diesel trucks, dust, volatile organic matter governance, optimizing transportation adjustment, industrial structure, energy structure and land use structure, strengthening regional interconnected defense control, striving to strengthen urban fine-tuning management, fully promoting green development, striving to make the blue sky more permanent in Beijing, no longer a rare precious place, and making it return to the background of people's photo books rather than a central role.
During this year's National Day of Celebration Golden Week, the city's tourism commission, industry, city management, public safety, and other relevant departments will step up enforcement checks on the day-trip market, focus on tourism, check for violations, and impose strict penalties.
Yesterday morning, the city council convened a conference on the topic of strictly illegal day trips, to deploy special operations to further strictly illegal day trips.
The meeting revealed, focusing on black tickets, black guides, black companies, black cars, black shops, black net interest chains intertwined with each other, and the city launched a strictly illegal day-trip special operation on July 28.
The special operation has been carried out so far, with the city receiving 39 complaints, down 63% from the previous year; this year, the city received 270 complaints, down 62%.
In the past two months, the city has seized 248 cars, shut down 158 tourist and travel businesses, shut down 29 shopping malls and theaters, seized 13 black companies, seized 260,000 illegal ads, removed 31 illegal travel billboards, seized 3 bus stoppers, seized 1,789 travel violations, seized 181 civil and criminal penalties, fined 4,480,000 yuan, and detained 111 people for travel violations.
After the remediation, the illegal day-to-day disorder was largely contained, and the market order was steadily moving towards a positive trend.
In recent years, the city has steadily increased its efforts to address illegal day trips.
In 2016 and 2017, the city's tourism commission received 1612 and 897 complaints, respectively, down 79% and 44% respectively, but illegal day trips still continue to bounce back and form intertwined interests chains such as black tickets, black guides, black companies, black cars, black shops, black net disorders.
Specifically, illegal street patrons such as black tickets, illegal websites that post fake tourist information such as the black net, travel agencies or non-tourist agencies that operate qualified agencies or individuals operating illegally, guides employed by non-guided travelers or illegal practitioners such as the black guide, vehicles that are used without qualified tourists or vehicles with qualified tourist services that provide customer services to illegal day travelers such as the black car, will ultimately bring them into the designated tourist shopping malls such as the black shop.
During this special operation, the city continued to intensify fixed inspections and mechanical patrols of illegal day trips, targeting illegal day trips with high frequency and high impact on tourist route sites, sending out daily ambush groups to make ambushes, finding evidence of violations, and following strictly enforced investigations.
Of these,                                                                                                  
According to the report, no black car, illegal day trip, and easy to spot, remember and locate, is impossible to achieve without black cars, as well as a single fixed asset of higher value.
 The relevant departments use road traffic monitoring to investigate and enhance the regulation of buses, buses and coaches, and technology and intelligence tools such as technical and logistics, to detect black vehicles in a timely manner.
Tourism shopping, due to the small number of shops, has also become a focus of strict focus.
To strengthen the resilience and strength of the fight against illegal day-trip, each of the special operations, once the violations are found, is subject to strict penalties from heavy to heavy enforcement.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to the strictly illegal Zayza Day Trip, discussing measures to combine administrative punishment with sentencing.
The city tourism commission said that in the future more formal travel agencies would be encouraged to carry out regular day trips to Beijing, increasing the supply of regular day trips to further fill up the living space for illegal day trips, specific schemes are currently under consideration.
In addition, the city tourism commission also continuously improves the tourism team's electronic single-travel information system, ensuring that each team is integrated into single-platform regulation of electronic travel.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economy symbol, what has Uzh Town experienced in these years?
As the permanent home of the World Internet Congress, how the Uzh Towns would receive the summit dividend is of particular interest.
Since the first World Internet Congress, five years of change in Uzh Town have been witnessed.
In 2014, there were only 12 businesses in the entire town that were connected to the digital economy and the Internet, and by the third quarter of this year, they had surpassed 500.
This is a summary of the development of the digital economy in Uzh.
The call for the Internet Congress, the desire to keep local businesses at bay from the digital economy, the inspiration of the digital wave, the desire to upgrade enterprise transformation, and the increasing investment and R&D of traditional manufacturing companies in the areas of human-machine switching, intelligent management, and more are all very strong.
The party committee secretary of Uzh Town said that the future of Uzh Town will create a new economic empowerment center.
The development of the digital economy is inseparable from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Uzh Town launched 5G pilot work on the basis of implementing 4G communication network and free WiFi full coverage.
At the same time, the town of U-town, as the first county-level city in the country to build an international Internet data channel, has also become a hotbed for Internet industry development.
Since the first World Internet Congress, the country has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects, with a total investment of 377.25 billion yuan, and the core manufacturing sector of the digital economy achieved a total output value of 8.773 billion yuan, an increase of 13% in value compared to the previous three quarters.
Previously, the town of Uzh was a tourist symbol, later it became a more dramatic and cultural symbol. Because of the Internet Congress, it has now become a symbol of the Internet and the digital economy.
The secretary of the 乡 municipal committee, Sheng Yongjun, believes that the dividend of the World Internet Congress accumulates over time, and therefore, there is a need to build a platform, to take on the overlapping import of talent, projects, technology, and other elements of the world.
Shenzh has been working abroad for 20 years, due to his connection to the Internet congress, returning home to start-up business.
On December 2, he entered the fourth Internet Light Expo with a high-capacity digital technology solution, which was favored by several customers.
Shen chose to start a business in Uzh Town not only because of the love of his hometown, but also because of the fact that in Uzh Town, recruiting is easier than I thought, our applications also land quickly, and we have our applications in the Uzh Town Smart Parking Project.
A street in Uzh, presenting the spillover effect of the Internet congress.
This highway through the town of Nanzh North not only connects tourist attractions, but also an industrial highway.
Based on it, the Uzh Town Avenue creative center should be operational.
The reporter learned that in the future, U Town Road will be the main site for rural industrial development, leading the way in the application of smart healthcare, smart retirement, smart governance, and other outcomes, concentrating 80% of the city's GDP on industry and numerous high-level talent.
A powerful earthquake in Indonesia that triggered the tsunami has killed at least 410 people.
According to the Director of Public Information of the Jakarta Police Department, 29th Night, the earthquake in Central Sulawesi province has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified.
Another 29 people were missing, and 540 were injured.
The Pallu airport is currently still closed.
zh positive treatment, China's survival rate of premature births at 29 weeks and above is 98%, zh has reached developed country levels.
China New Internet Shanghai September 30th, 2017 (Chenshing) National Children's Medical Center, the Hospital for Sick Children of the University of Pusan, announced that it has introduced advanced methods in Canada in the early-stage quality improvement program of the Chinese NICU Residency in China.
 Project results show that, after positive treatment, China's survival rate of 29 weeks and older premature babies has reached 98 percent, reaching developed country levels, but there is still room for significant improvement in survival rates of premature babies and premature babies without complications at very young ages.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese government has been focusing on the treatment of newborns.
Currently, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71 ‰, significantly below the national average, reaching advanced levels in developed countries.
China's NICU Pre-natal Quality Improvement Project has significantly improved the quality of life of premature babies through four years of continuous efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the University of Zhengzhou, told reporters that while improving survival rates for premature babies, focusing on reducing survival rates, reducing complications, improving the prognosis of neurodevelopment, improving the overall outcome of the child, is important for improving overall survival and demographic quality of premature babies, is an important concern for the domestic and international pediatric community, as well as a key concern for this project.
China's NICU Pre-natal Health Quality Improvement Project Through four years of continuous efforts, recruiting tens of thousands of fetuses aged 33 weeks and under, has resulted in a 1/3 decrease in the domestic mortality rate of premature infants of childhood age and birth weight, while significantly reducing the incidence of severe complications of premature birth, significantly improving the survival of premature babies.
The project will be implemented by establishing a national network of collaborative efforts to improve the quality of newborns, introducing the concept of collaborative quality improvement, radiating 25 collaborative hospitals across China, establishing a set of collaborative improvements to the country's domestic situation, improving early childhood prognosis, improving the level of newborn care, and developing a complete, systematic, effective collaborative quality improvement methodology.
The University of Zhengzhou affiliated pediatric hospital is joining forces with the national neonatal force, based on project experience, developing guidelines for the diagnosis of neonatal infections, providing reference and guidance for the standard clinical treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in China's pre-natal quality improvement project, the pediatrician has introduced the EPIQ method in 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces nationwide, working to address the problem of early childhood infection in China's newborn care facilities.
After more than a decade of continuous improvement, Canada's national survival rate for premature babies without complications has increased by about one-third, and Canada is currently ranked as one of the best countries in the world for premature babies.
The EPIQ method has now been applied to all NICUs across Canada, and has been adopted by six countries.
According to the pediatric hospital, the results of the study showed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, infection in premature babies decreased by 35%, while antibiotic use decreased by 20%.
In the future, the University of Patanj affiliated pediatric hospital will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, with a focus on reducing the overall incidence of all complications in premature births, improving the quality of newborn care nationwide.
Currently, there are differences in the level of treatment in different regions of China, and the disparity is an indisputable fact.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important building block of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation, this study covers several western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guizhou, Guangzhou, and西, in order to gradually promote the homogenization and standardization of neonatal care nationwide.
It is understood that the Hospital for Sick Children of the University of Zhengzhou is joining forces with the national neonatal force, based on the accumulated experience of the project, to develop guidelines for the treatment of neonatal infections, to provide reference and guidance for the standard clinical treatment of neonatal infections in China.
As revealed, in 2019, the coordination center, located in the China Neonatal Collaborative Network of the Hospital for Children affiliated with the University of Zhengzhou, will combine 63 hospitals nationwide to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement, in order to promote the uniform development of the level of neonatal care in China.
Shanghai City Health and Life Commission Director Zhang Taorei said that Shanghai can become a central city in the center of Asia, not only reflecting research, but also the construction of the entire service system, service quality and service outcomes should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's medical level.
辛识平: Build a hero's monument in your heart written on the fifth anniversary of the martyrs.
On September 30, the eve of the Republic's 69th birthday, we marched into the fifth anniversary of the martyrdom, and Xi'an Equality Party and national leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend the flower basket ceremony to pay homage to the people's heroes.
In this moment, wherever you are, please pay your respects to Ingzh.
Memorial Day is a re-awakening, but also a wake-up call.
The history of the martyrs, the names of each martyr, is a living history.
They, too, have a hot youth, a true love, a close family.
However, because they firmly believe in the fundamental principle of our faith, which is the truth of the universe, they are willing to sacrifice everything they have to save the next generation from suffering.
One day I'll live, I'll cry out for China one day.
Through time and space, the sages erected a spiritual road sign, pointing in the direction of the advance.
 Where did you come from, where did you go zh What kind of person you are , read well, and find answers easily
The memorial is so intense, and most importantly, a monument to the heroes is erected in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the years of the Revolutionary War, some 20 million martyrs have dedicated themselves to national independence, people's liberation, national prosperity and heroism.
For various reasons, many of the priests did not even leave their last name.
Countless people have been soaked with ideals, practiced faith with life, remembered their great names, inherited their spirit, which is the root and soul of the nation's preservation.
This monument to heroes will not allow any damage or destruction.
For some time, the historical vacuum, the pan-entertainment, and other dark currents have been on the rise.
History is distorted, practices are violently damaged, justice is challenged, values are misjudged, and public outrage and alarm is raised in society as a whole.
The heroes cannot be forgotten, and the heroes cannot be abused.
To act against the bottom line, unable to be heard, must be bold to shine a sword, to defend the dignity of the people with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1 of this year, the Heroes and Martyrs Protection Act officially came into effect.
From the judicial perspective, the verdict in some cases is very speedy, both effectively maintaining a bright image and releasing the positive energy of revered heroes and admirers.
A nation with aspirations cannot live without heroes, and a nation with ideals cannot live without a leader.
The memory of the heroic call has become a universal social consensus.
Currently, there are millions of memorials of all kinds throughout the country, with over a hundred million people visiting the Shrine of the Martyrs every year.
The human heart is the strongest cornerstone.
To honor heroes, defend heroes, learn heroes, love heroes, and to integrate the spirit of heroism into the national blood, a monument to heroes will be erected between heaven and earth, deep within the human heart.
Reuters Brussels, 28 September - After Italy defied the EU's demands and surprised the market with a massive budget deficit, the EU took a non-confrontational stance on Friday against Italy, but if Italy adheres to its bold goal, the EU may take a more radical stance.
The Italian government has set a target of a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP for the next three years, indicating that debt reductions are not yet possible even if the deficit is required.
On Friday, the Economic Affairs Commissioner of the European Union (ECEU) said that we are not interested in the crisis between the ECEU and Italy, and that he has taken a cautious response, since the EU's recommendations and sanctions may have little effect on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that before Italy formally submits it to the European Commission in October, market forces will be able to convince Italy to adjust its budgetary plans.
After the government announced its plans, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while the Italian bond yield hit its highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains the same before the October deadline, the EU Executive Committee may reject Italy's draft budget, something that the Executive Committee has never done for any country.
The vice-chairman of the European Commission, East Bławski, later said at a meeting in Riga, Latvia, on Friday that Italy's current fiscal plan appeared to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Convention, referring to the EU's fiscal regulations.
But he did not say what reaction this would provoke in the EU.
The bidder can submit an application to participate in this public tender by October 26 of this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture ranked China as one of the top markets for exporting Russian agricultural products.

Xinjiang Shaia (丹丹王小军) is a test base for the cultivation of non-membered cotton in Xinjiang Shaia County, with no membrane cotton, which is not inferior to the adjacent earthen cotton, a snow-white cotton contest open, with branches hanging over it.
From September 27 to 28, a national non-membrane field survey and exchange of ideas was held in Xinjiang Shaia County.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that, with the main non-membrane cotton technology system in place, which is based on cotton619 and its accompanying cultivation measures, the cotton field has been initially achieved to achieve the goal of non-membrane cultivation, the reduction of the residual cotton field of Xinjiang to environmental and raw cotton pollution, and the achievement of significant advances in non-membrane integrated technology research and demonstration.
The academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, a renowned cotton geneticist, the national modern agricultural industrial technology system, the cotton system, the chief scientist of the Cotton System, gave a presentation to Zhengzhou Cong, the party secretary of the Zhejiang Agricultural and Forestry University, about the growth of non-membered cotton.
 Our integrated technology developed without membrane cotton can fully achieve the cultivation of cotton without the need for a membrane, can completely solve the problem of residual contamination, can achieve green cotton 
Chinese Academy of Engineering professor of physics is introduced.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton producing region in China, according to the National Statistics Office, with 35 million hectares of cotton planted in 2017, accounting for 61% of the country's total cotton area.
Since the introduction of the earthenware in China in 1982, the surface of the Xinjiang region's crop-based crop covers more than 50 million hectares, with an annual use of about 300,000 hectares.
Of these, cotton coverage is 100%, cotton coverage accounts for about 60% of Xinjiang's total use of cotton.
 Non-membrane cotton for testing, cotton production can be fully achieved output of 320 kg to 350 kg
With the increasing volume of Xinjiang's landfill inputs, low reclaim rate, gradual increase in soil residues, a series of problems such as soil structure destruction caused by residues, and severe impacts on sustainable agriculture, the report said.
The residual membrane not only causes serious soil contamination, but also has a major impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
Currently, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanically harvested.
In 2017, Xinjiang's cotton production area was about 14 million square meters.
The machine-made cotton harvesting process generates a large amount of surface area, the shrapnel on cotton stock, the rusty shrapnel in raw cotton is difficult to remove during the raw cotton processing process, and cannot be completely removed during subsequent textile processing, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28, a national non-membrane field survey, workshop and exchange event was held in Xinjiang Shaia County.
He led his team through eight years of efforts to address cotton-field membrane pollution, simplify cotton planting techniques, improve cotton field efficiency, implement cotton-free planting techniques, and green development for Xinjiang agriculture.
The introduction of the tree, through innovative breeding new ideas, cultivates a very early ripening, salt-resistant, low-temperature, and richly producing new varieties of cotton.
  中棉619 has achieved a series of support measures such as mechanical support for seeding without membranes, depth improvement of seeding, drop pipe with shallow seeding, suitable seed density filtration, reasonable chemical controls, and so on in the southern region of Xinjiang.
Currently, demonstration bases without film have been established in Aksoy, Kuller, Aralzh and other locations, with a production capacity of 4,800 kg per hectare.
The production of non-membrane cotton has been achieved through the production of high-quality, high-quality, environmental protection, and overall improved efficiency.
Zhang海, a farmer and technician at the Xinjiang Production Construction Troop Third Division Agricultural and Agricultural Department, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of non-membrane cotton cultivation techniques, the production of non-membrane cotton can be fully achieved from 320 kg to 350 kg, or possibly even higher.
The potential for the use of non-permeable cotton cultivation technology is high.
Zhang海 believes that currently, non-membrane cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual contamination, but there is still a gap in the current economic benefits of soil cultivation.
 Supporting the cotton purchase price will be beneficial for future promotion 
He said that the next step, he and his team will continue to do in-depth research and extensive application of filmless coating, expand and strengthen the industry, and thoroughly address soil pollution caused by the earth's crust.

Chinese State Counsellor and Foreign Minister Wang Zheng said in a speech to the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee on Friday that, at the moment, China-U.S. relations have once again come to a crossroads, and that if both sides can actively embrace each other, expand deeper positive cooperation, and properly manage their differences and contradictions, better prospects can be opened.
China-US relations are our common asset, and we need to work together to protect them.
He said he hopes the two countries will have the wisdom to maintain healthy and stable development of China-US relations through practical action, and jointly push China-US relations forward in the right direction.
Wang Zheng stressed once again that China will definitely take a different path of development from the traditional great powers.
This Chinese-characterized road determines whether or not China will and will not repeat the overthrow of the dominant nation, and also determines whether or not China will become the United States, challenge the United States, or replace the United States.
In a speech entitled Opportunity or Challenge, Partner or Opposition, Wang Zhen said that the deepest implication of the current problem is that some American friends believe China will also be a strong country, even challenging and replacing America's leadership in the world.
This is clearly a major strategic misjudgment.
But this self-imaginative suspicion is spreading, and it has amplified existing contradictions, raised new doubts, and made it more difficult to resolve specific issues between China and the US, facing more resistance.
Wang Zhen pointed out that China has followed a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had an outwardly expanding gene.
相信各国可以和zhzh共存,交流, and know each other.
Whether past, present or future, China will neither follow a pattern of moving abroad nor require other countries to replicate China's practice.
Earlier, during a meeting with former US Secretary of State Kissinger in New York, Wang said that China-US cooperation would be a win-win, and opposition would inevitably be a loss.
China has always been committed to developing a healthy and stable long-term China-US relationship, achieving conflict-free, non-conflict, mutual respect, cooperation and win-win.

Both of these quotas are well above the existing production levels of both countries, providing room for growth for exports to both countries.
Reuters Washington/Mexico, September 28 - Mexico said Friday that after days of debate, the administration of US President Donald Trump and Canada are making a concrete effort to resolve trade policy differences, and that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is expected to maintain a trilateral agreement format.
Although details are lacking, the above obvious progress is enough to prompt the Mexican and U.S. governments to suddenly stop their plans to publish the text of the bilateral trade agreement, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had put forward a new counter-proposal to the Canadian government, and said he would continue to push all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexico's Economy Minister Gualdo Ildefonso Guajardo said the time for submitting the text of the bilateral trade agreement to Mexican and U.S. legislation was delayed, due to the very serious attempts by the governments of Canada and the United States to reach an agreement.
Gualdo said, "In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a trilateral agreement text or whether we will have to publish the text of the bilateral agreement".
Gualdo said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts specifically requested that the publication of the text be delayed.
A spokesman for the US Trade Representative Office (USTR) has not commented on the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement and the US-Canada negotiations.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Foreign Minister of Canada did not respond to a request for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media reports, in a nursing home outside the South African capital of Pretoria, two young lions are playing together, making it difficult to see any anomalies, although they are not unique.
The University of Pretoria announced:  This is the first ever human-born lion cubs ― ― the world's first pair of human-born lions ― 
Scientists at the school are working on the reproductive system of the African lion's mother.
Ganswynt, director of the University of Pretoria's Institute of Mammals, said the two young lions born on August 25 were both healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally achieved this breakthrough.
Ganswint said in a press interview: "We have extracted semen from a healthy male lion.
Next, researchers performed artificial insemination for the hormone when the hormone content in the female body, such as the lioness, reached the appropriate level.
Ganswint said:   Luckily, the result was successful  zh.
He said the researchers had made several attempts, but unexpectedly, they did not spend much energy.
He said that the previous study broke the repeatability test, and scientists hope to use this technology to save endangered large cat species.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature notes that lions have become extinct in 26 countries in Africa, with the total number of wild lions surviving declining by 43% over the past 20 years to around 20,000.
African lions are listed as endangered by this organization.
Ganswint says:  If we don't do something about these animals, they will face extinction.
He said that this new technology does not have to feed the lion, but only inject sperm into the body of a conceivable female lion, as was done in North America and Europe with captive elephants.
South Korea's September export decline was the largest in more than two years, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days, and said that despite rising trade tensions between China and the US, global demand for South Korean goods was still strong.
Indeed, South Korea's average monthly exports increased.
In addition, data on initial value released earlier showed that exports in the first few weeks of September before the long holiday period increased by two digits.
The decline in South Korea's September exports was the largest since July 2016, a decline greater than the decline in the estimated revenue of 5.7% from the Reuters survey of 11 analysts.
The initial value announced on Monday showed September exports were $50.6 billion, down from $51.2 billion in August.
Despite concerns that the escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China could cause other Chinese neighbors who depend on exports to also suffer, South Korea's export to China grew 7.8 percent in September, its 23rd consecutive month of expansion.
South Korean exports to the United States fell by 11.8 percent as oil sales fell.
Overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products grew 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called chip supercycle may have already peaked.
 However, the effects of the trade conflict will be hard to avoid, as South Korea's exports are largely dependent on the US and Chinese markets.zh
Imports fell 2.1 percent to $40.8 billion, or less than the growth of 3.1 percent predicted by the Reuters survey.
The initial trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, with the help of the United States and the EU, global manufacturing will continue to thrive, which is a favorable factor for South Korean exports.
The statement noted that the increase in export prices caused by the rise in oil prices would also benefit exports in the second half of this year.
 However, the continued trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with the increased market volatility following the US rate hike, are all negative pressures on exports.
The average weekday export in September increased to $2.6 billion, reaching $2.1 billion in August.
This year, the Mid-Autumn Festival in South Korea falls on September 24-26, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four fewer days than in the same period last year.
South Korea's exports for September 1 grew by 4.7% over the same period last year.
According to Japan's Japan Times/Markit Procurement Manager Index, manufacturing activity in South Korea picked up in September, but was supported by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan dropped, which may have overshadowed other export prospects.
North Korean media has criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions against North Korea.
North Korea's Labor News posted a signed commentary on September 30, criticizing the United States for not relaxing sanctions on the North while seeking dialogue with the North, calling it a "self-contradictory practice".
The article said that U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo said that the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the implementation of sanctions against North Korea, and stressed that the United States continued to maintain its unchanging stance on the implementation of UN sanctions resolutions.
In a joint statement from Singapore, the two sides pledged to establish a new North American relationship with the people of both countries that would be in line with their hopes for peaceful prosperity.
The United States, on the one hand, has increased sanctions and increased pressure, and on the other, has demanded dialogue, a practice that is undoubtedly contradictory.
If new North-American relations are to be established, a permanent peace settlement on the Korean Peninsula is to be established, and the Korean Peninsula is to be completely denuclearized, trust-building should come first, starting with what can be done, and be addressed in stages.
The article also says that the United States should understand that imposing sanctions on North Korea is not feasible.
Even the USS North Devensk before the attack, the article says, made the U.S. Army applaud.
The National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying: "We will face a powerful potential opponent.
The current commander-in-chief of the US Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the submarine, the North Devensk.
He said:  This submarine is impressive. See the development of the Russian Navy, how resources are used, and its main research and development efforts are primarily to strengthen the submarine fleet.
But the National Interest magazine still considers the United States to maintain its advantage over Russia in this area.
福戈 said:  I believe Western countries still have an asymmetrical advantage.
Earlier, it was reported that the Russian Navy will be equipped with the submarine "Kazakhstan" in 2019.
The newly launched Kassam-Siberian-class submarine, the newly launched Krasnoyarsk-class submarine, the Alhangelsk-class multi-purpose submarine, is an improved type of the Kassam-M, with a discharge of 13,800 tons, a submerged depth of 520 meters, a crew of 64 men, a speed of 31 knots, and will carry a torpedo, torpedo and caliber and a cruise guide.

This is his first time attending the forum.
Ignore the threat posed by the United States!
The EU will either reach an agreement with Iran to buy crude oil or negotiate a deal with Iran.
The US government announced in November that it would resume a new round of sanctions against Iran, and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
However, the US allies do not seem to have listened to the US.
According to the New York Times, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed in an interview on 29 May that despite the threat of sanctions from the United States against any country doing business with Iran, Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the EU on the sale of crude oil.
The main purpose of this protocol is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, i.e. a way of pricing currencies or currencies, to replace dollar transactions.
The purpose of this approach is to try to circumvent the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
Meanwhile, while the EU is working to push for the deal, some French and British officials also worry that if it is reached, it will be the most public confrontation between the EU and the US against the US withdrawing from the nuclear deal.
In an hour-long interview, Zarif's comments sounded more optimistic than in recent months, according to the American media.
Because the agreement has the ability to strip away the traditional allies of the United States, it effectively breaks down US efforts to cut Iranian revenue.
 This will ensure that we sell oil and profit , , Zalev believes, under the agreement reached in 2015, countries have the legal right to trade with Iran
Federica Mogherini, EU foreign policy chief, also said earlier that no sovereign country or organisation can accept others to decide who they can trade with.
However, she also predicted that before the next round of sanctions was imposed by the US government in November, US leaders could take a series of financial measures aimed at banks, businesses and states that do business with Tehran.
In May of this year, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds of a defective agreement, saying that the agreement could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The U.S. then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat has forced some companies to evacuate Tehran, and Iran's currency has plunged.
Airlines and French oil giant Davalz have already cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said the US government may be taking over the country.
However, according to a recent Turkish media report, US sanctions do not appear to have had a significant impact on Iranian oil exports.
Iran's oil minister Zanganeh Yan has said that no country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani both believe that the purpose of a series of US actions is to seduce Iran into breaking the agreement.
Zarif also felt indifferent to a series of verbal attacks on the US, and when asked if the US would overthrow the current Iranian government under increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, "It's a regime change strategy, that's the real purpose of the US".

The reporter learned from the National Health and Safety Council that the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased compared to decades ago, while the incidence of obesity has increased significantly.
 Experts note that maintaining a healthy weight, the most important concept is 治未病, vigorous promotion of scientific fitness, reasonable nutrition.
According to the National Health Commission's recent release of the core information and interpretation of China's youth health education, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is a healthy diet and scientific exercise.
Being overweight, obese, and losing weight blindly are all bad for your health.
The health risks behind being fat cannot be ignored.
Dingzheng, director of nutrition and health at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that being overweight poses a risk to teenagers' normal growth and development, adversely affects their psychology, behavior, cognition, and intelligence, and can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high blood fat in children.
At the same time, teenagers who are overweight and prone to prolonging into adulthood will increase the risk of developing chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes and other chronic diseases in later adulthood.
Ding Steel Strong said, "The 2010-2012 nutrition and health status testing of Chinese residents showed that China's 6- to 17-year-old children and adolescents had a 9.6% overweight rate, a 6.4% obesity rate, and a 16% obesity rate combined".
At the same time, childhood adolescents are overweight and have higher rates of male overweight than female, urban overweight than rural, and obesity rates have risen significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers cope with being overweight?
Zhang, deputy director of the National Sports Agency's Center for Research on Science Fitness and Health Promotion, noted that the main cause of teenage obesity is excessive heat intake, low physical activity, and lack of exercise.
 For this kind of sheer obesity, scientific exercise should be given special attention along with reasonable dietary controls
Zhang pointed out that maintaining a healthy weight, the most important concept is 治未病, of which an important component is a comprehensive comprehensive education of schools, parents and students, the spread of the dangers of overweight and obesity, and the improvement of prevention awareness among adolescents.
zh teenagers should be regularly tested, monitored for growth and development indicators, and early detection, scientifically determined overweight and obesity, so that timely interventions can be taken.
 For adolescents who are already overweight, Ding Zheng Steel recommends, in addition to the scientifically proactive regulation of diet and exercise, adolescents are in a special physiological stage, should avoid using starvation or semi-starvation therapy to control and lose weight, and should avoid taking weight loss medications without being blindly sedated.
Reuters, September 28 - Facebook (FB.O) said Friday that hackers stealing digital landing codes, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, involving an unprecedented face-to-face, was its worst security breach ever.
Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, saying it is not yet clear whether the attacker abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company also did not locate the hacking site, nor was it certain whether the hack was targeting specific victims.
Its initial analysis shows that this was a large-scale attack.
CEO Zuckerberg said during a press conference that the incident was really serious.
A company spokesman said his account and that of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg were also affected.
Facebook shares fell 2.6 percent on Friday, dragging on the main stock market of Wall Street.
A US congressman said Friday that the attack could increase the outcry about data privacy legislation.
This is yet another unfortunate piece of evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users, Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner Rohit Choprazh tweeted, "I hope that we get an answer to the reporting by Reuters of this security breach".

The newly revised 三峡-葛洲 waterway hub navigation regulation (hereinafter abbreviated 调度规则) officially began to be implemented on 1 October, the 三峡升降机 was officially unified with the ship two years after the piloted flight.
On the first day of implementation of the new regulations, the waters of the Three Gorges-Gyeongju are well-ordered.
The Yangtze Sungai Tsang Tsang Aviation Authority released its first safety inspection plan on September 30, 2021, and conducted safety inspections on 160 vessels, a total of 124 vessels qualified for safety inspection.
On October 1, at 14 a.m., the aviation department arranged the first filtering plan after the new regulations were implemented.
After the new regulations were implemented, the safety inspection plan was published once daily at 9am and 21pm, the filtration plan was published once daily at 14pm and 20pm, making it easier for ships to flexibly arrange the filtration plan.
The  scheduling schedule has added the  classification control principle of ship filtering, which, based on the positioning of the ship's and lifting ship's functions, specifies the priority order of the ship, and aligns the short-line passenger ship filter to the same priority rank as the demonstration ship and the integrity ship.
This is also the official alignment with the ship after two years of lift aircraft testing.
The large-length demonstration vessels and new energy-powered vessels in the Kauai River and the Three Gorges of the Kuzh Region were also given priority status for the first time.
At the same time, the  调度规则 will adjust the water management area of 通航调度管理 from the previous 180 km near water to the 541.8 km water area of the Yangtze River Bridge to the Jiangxi River Bridge, and divide the core water area into the near water area of the control area of the water and the water control area of the   .
This will help the ship select the right water treatment facility, reducing the amount of water that can be used to treat the vessel.
 the adjustment procedure also proposed, based on the existing ship filtering characteristics, integrity restrictions such as cancellation of ship declarations, delayed filing 24 hours, and other measures for the violation of ship conduct
After the water accumulation of the Three Gorges, the conditions of the Kuzhong shipping area improved, which facilitated the rapid development of the Yangtze shipping industry.
Data shows that the volume of goods shipped by the Three Gorges and the Gyatso Islands increased from 34.3 million in 2004 to 1.3 million in 2017 and 1.4 million in 2017.
The three-strange lift aircraft has been in service for two years, carrying 5,767 passengers, 16,220,000 passengers and 171,280,000 cargo.
Chen Jingyu, deputy director of the Three Gorges Administration, said that the regulation has a positive role to play in promoting the integrity of the airline management, maintaining the airline's order, reducing pressure on ships in the zone, and improving air navigation capabilities.

In September, China's overall PMI ratio improved  Manufacturing PMI ratio declined 
The figures released by the Office for National Statistics of China on 30 September show that in September, China's overall PMI output index was 54.1%, up 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points from the previous month and yearly averages, indicating that the overall activity of Chinese enterprises in production and operations remained stable.
For the month, the manufacturing output index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which comprise the comprehensive PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9% respectively, respectively, down one liter per year.
Of these, the Chinese manufacturing PMI was 50.8 percent, down 0.5 percentage points.
According to Zhongqing, the PMI of the manufacturing industry this month is mainly characterized by five aspects:
One is that the manufacturing fundamentals are generally flat.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, 14 have a PMI of expansion, with manufacturing such as pharmaceutical, specialty equipment, electrical machinery and equipment having a PMI of over 53.5% higher than operating levels, and a faster growth rate.
The second is a small fluctuation in supply and demand.
Production and new orders were 53.0% and 52.0% respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, supply and demand continued to remain stable, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively, below 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points in the previous month, respectively, and the economy fell to year-on-year lows.

路透网 路透网 古屋 5 November - The president of the Central Bank of Japan, Mr. Blackata Toriyama, said Monday that the central bank was aware that the long-term implementation of a monetary policy that was too loose could squeeze the interest rates of financial institutions and could undermine the stability of the country's banking system.
But he said that given the low inflation rate and uncertainty overseas economies, the Japanese central bank needs to sustain its massive stimulus program while closely monitoring the benefits and drawbacks of its policies.
The Central Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the continuing monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected, Black Tamiya said in a speech to business leaders at the Nagoya House.
If financial institutions take the risk more actively to offset the effects of declining interest rates caused by years of low interest rates, once a serious negative shock occurs, the banking system could be in turmoil, he said.
 Although these risks are not significant at present, the central bank will closely monitor developments in the situation, encouraging financial institutions to take the necessary measures, he said
Records of the meeting of the Central Bank of Japan, which were released earlier on Monday, show that at the September meeting of the Central Bank of Japan's policy committee, the policy committee discussed the continuing rise in the cost of long-term easing policies.
According to the meeting records, a member of the committee said that if the economy continues to expand, the future of the Bank of Japan will have more room for policy flexibility.
The meeting records show that another member of the committee said that, given its limited policy duration, the committee should discuss how long the central bank of Japan can sustain the stimulus policy.
The central bank will assess the financial risks of the easing policy, while also considering the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global demand due to China-US trade friction and rising protectionism, according to Mr. Black.
 The impact of such issues on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited,  黑田zh东彦 said.
 But as the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy may increase,  he added.
 It is necessary to continuously pursue a strong monetary easing policy while balancing the positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner,  黑田东彦 said.
Despite the growing disadvantages of the radical stimulus program, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, low inflation forced the Japanese central bank to maintain the program.
The Central Bank of Japan last month maintained monetary policy; facing the risks posed by the global trade war, Mr. Toriyama ruled out any possible interest rate hike in the near future.
June 1, 2018, the company logo on the Cardiff, Tesla electric car in the United States.
Under a settlement agreement, Tesla of America and its CEO Musk have agreed to pay a fine of $20 million to their respective financial regulators, and Musk will also step down as chairman of the company, but remain as CEO.
The settlement agreement will be the first of two months of unrest for Tesla.
The securities fraud allegations and settlement agreement, disclosed Saturday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, will reassure investors.
Investors were concerned that the protracted legal battle would only further hurt this still-losing electric car company.
The SEC on Thursday sued Musk for fraud, calling his tweet of August 7th "misleading investors".
 According to Twitter, he is considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per share and has secured financing.
The SEC said these tweets were baseless, and the market turmoil they caused hurt investors.
According to investors and corporate governance experts, the deal could potentially strengthen Tesla, which has suffered heavy losses as a result of Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common's asset management, said the settlement should put Musk under more scrutiny, while not taking any destructive steps to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company owns shares in Panasonic, the battery manufacturer of Tesla.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors, and a board of directors to regulate Musk's communications with the outside world.
"This matter was quickly resolved in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions that were in our best interests and to our investors, including Tesla shareholders, in accordance with our market and our interests", SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's allegations led to Tesla's market value evaporating by about $7 billion, the company's market value at $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion for General Motors.
The SEC recovered the demand in the settlement to remove Musk from the company's position of manager.
Many investors say that the penalty would be catastrophic.
I think this is the best possible outcome for all concerned, said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, Feinseth gave Tesla a neutral rating, and said the SEC's punishment for Musk was "from a light penalty".
He is still important to Tesla as CEO.
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement, nor immediately responded to a request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning Post reported that the Beijing Morning Post reporter learned from Beijing Construction Group yesterday that one of the core building blocks of the 2019 Beijing World Park Park Park -- the Beijing World Park Theater Project will for the first time use a multi-colored ETFE puzzle film structure, a 5440-square-meter film structure that will present six colors of deep red, deep green, blue, red, green, and butterfly-winged patterns under the drawing of the Lhasa steel line.
According to Beijing Jianwu Five Construction Group project manager Zheng Bao, the arena has an engineering building area of 4,500 square meters, installed with a total steel capacity of 1,182, steel roofs are made of 26-shaped suspended steel trays, and the shape of butterfly wings is shown below the lace of the Lhasa steel line.
 Overlooking the theater from the air, the colorful roofs look like flowers, and the bright colors do not fade with the passage of time and the wind and snow.
Previously, single-color ETFE membrane structures had been widely used in bird nesting, watershed, and other projects, but multi-colored ETFE membrane structures were the first of their kind in the country.
The reporter learned that, given the limited number of suppliers worldwide with the ability to produce a wide variety of colored film structures, the material for each inch of film structure is very valuable.
To avoid overlapping and overlapping positions at the end of the rope, he said, he also innovates with the use of a double-forked rope structure, which ensures that the rope ends at the right position through custom-made fixed plugins.
The construction of the current 2019 Beijing World Heritage Park is currently underway.
Among them, International Palace Engineering has completed all the hanging works of the flower.
The planned project will be in full swing by the end of October.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the P&I conference, instilling strong confidence in the private sector's move towards a broader stage.
Xi Jinping, the Secretary-General, stressed that letting entrepreneurs unpack ideas and move forward would create a stronger community among large-scale entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
The market dynamics come from people, especially entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, tens of millions of entrepreneurs have created stories of innovation, entrepreneurship has grown, and China's economy has been steadily moving forward.
For some time now, people in the social sphere have made some negative, questionable statements about the private economy.
Misconceptions such as the so-called "private economy off the ground" theory and the "new public-private partnership theory" have raised some entrepreneurs' doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private companies have encountered many difficulties and problems in developing their business.
For example, the changing international economic environment has affected some exporting companies; rapid adjustment of demand structure has brought about transformational upgrading pressures; some policies are not coordinated, policy effects overlap, or the way of working is simple, causing some good policies to have the opposite effect, etc.
The interplay of various factors, the private economy in difficulty, some private enterprises in difficulty, entrepreneurs expressing a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting misconceptions about knowledge, undoing entrepreneurial thinking, making enterprises work for development, government work for development, and the confidence of the market and expectations of development are of particular practical significance.
At this meeting, I once again stressed three important conclusions that have not changed: The status and role of the non-public economy in the development of our country's economic and social development has not changed!
From deeply promoting the empowerment of the simple regime, establishing a list of powers to creating a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate interests of entrepreneurs, creating a fairly competitive market environment, shaping an atmosphere in which entrepreneurs are respected by society as a whole, the CCP has in recent years been unmatched by the importance of entrepreneurship and the strength of the system.
The conference also made clear that there would be strong policy initiatives to support the development of the private sector in six areas, and introduced a series of practical actions to facilitate the advancement of the private sector.
All of this has given great encouragement to the entrepreneurial community, and has given more hope to all sections of society.
The fog is clear, the direction is set, the key is to implement it.
To continuously create a better development environment for the private sector, to help private enterprises solve development difficulties, to help achieve China's economic transformation and upgrading; to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, secure in legitimate business, respected in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential.
China's economy is entering a process of high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to show ambition, and also providing greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to play creatively.
We have reason to believe that as further reforms and breakdowns are deepened, the private sector economy will provide better development prospects and development opportunities, moving towards a broader stage.

Exports to China have increased sharply by 20 times in four years.Analysis: It is linked to the growth of youth in the nest.
Last year, South Korea's exports to China exceeded $100,000, a sharp increase of about 20 times from 2013 four years ago.

As of this year, Chinese households per capita had surpassed 200 million households, which is expected to grow to 30% of the total population by 2020, and local food companies have also been preparing to introduce a variety of convenience foods.
In addition, the analysis also notes that avian influenza is the biggest barrier to entry into the Chinese mainland market.
A bird flu outbreak in South Korea from November 2016 to April last year, with the relevant authorities banning exports to China, led to a sharp decline in exports, a report by aT said.
In 2016, China's exports to China amounted to $840,000, and due to avian influenza, last year's exports plunged to $100,000.

 The holding of the National Flag Raising Ceremony at important times such as New Year's Day, Spring Festival, and National Day of China not only reflects the Chinese image but also inspires the national spirit of the people of the borders.
The officers of the ceremonial squadron who participated in the raising of the flag said:

During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, parties released some positive messages around the issue of the Korean Peninsula.
South Korean President Wen Jiazhong reiterated North Korea's irreversible decision to abandon its nuclear weapons, and said that U.S. President Trump and North Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The State Department later said that Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to push for the implementation of the Singapore pledge made by the US leader.
From the beginning of this year to the present, North Korea has broken the ice to open the path of dialogue, the leaders of North Korea and the United States have held meetings, the main trend of easing the situation on the peninsula has continued, dialogue to resolve the problem of the peninsula has also been upheld.
First, the essence of the problem of the peninsula is that it is a security issue, this has not changed, achieving the peace of the peninsula is key, the key is to properly balance and resolve the reasonable security concerns of each party, rather than one side pressuring the other, one side stressing their own demands.
Second, in the dialogue on the desertification of the peninsula, there was disagreement among the parties on the steps and methods to achieve the desertification of the peninsula, due to the long-standing lack of political trust between North and South America, and the ongoing debate about who came first and who came next remains tense.
At the Security Council's public meeting on the North Korean peninsula, held at the United Nations headquarters in New York, the two sides' voices on the issue of sanctions against North Korea were different, again highlighting that these two points on the peninsula remain unchanged.
US Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that sanctions against North Korea would not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula was completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed the principle of responding to action by pointing out that the weakening trend in sanctions should be in line with the pace of North Korea's gradual abandonment of its nuclear path.
There is no doubt that all parties concerned should continue to fully, fully, accurately implement the Security Council resolutions, but pressure is not the goal, enforcing sanctions and promoting political solutions are the requirements of the Security Council resolution, both of which cannot be overridden, neither can be chosen.
As Chinese State Counsellor and Foreign Minister Wang Zhong has said, given the positive progress currently made in North Korea-North America relations, China believes it is necessary for the Security Council to consider timely triggering of irreversible provisions, thereby encouraging North Korea and related parties to take greater steps toward denuclearization.
Looking back, every step in the past, in the process of denuclearization and peace, requires political courage from all sides.
Currently, faced with the growing expectations of the international community to promote political settlement of the peninsula, all parties concerned should show political will, make political decisions, implement commitments, solve problems, continue to take the forward step, and simultaneously advance the process of denuclearization of the peninsula with the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula, jointly launching a permanent peace on the peninsula.

A quarterly report on the short-term survey published by the Central Bank of Japan on Monday showed that in September the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in the quarter reached a year-on-year low, due to the rising cost of raw materials and the impact of a series of natural disasters on production, which put pressure on enterprises.
This survey has shown little to show that escalating global trade tensions have hurt the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-scale trade war has hit the business outlook of the company, potentially threatening corporate capital expenditures.
Active capital expenditure is a highlight of the Japanese economy.
The survey cast doubt on the JCB's view that a robust expansion will help drive inflation to accelerate to the 2% target, although there are signs that businesses are gradually shifting costs to customers.
 In the wake of concerns raised by the global trade war, manufacturers' confidence in manufacturing has been stagnating due to slowing exports and weak factory production,   said Nan Wuzhi, chief researcher at the Agricultural and Forestry Research Institute.
Confidence is still high and as business profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to fall either.
A short-term survey showed that the September large-scale manufacturing economy assessment index fell from just 21 three months ago to just 19, deteriorating for the third straight quarter.
The market's estimated median value is 22.
The September large non-manufacturing economy assessment index has declined from June's survey of positive 24 to positive 22, deteriorating for the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters investigation was positive 22.
 The survey shows that the average of the December assessment of the economies of large manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries has remained stable.
Investors are not concerned about the decline in the short-term business economy index, the N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday, as the continued devaluation helped improve the export earnings outlook for Japanese businesses.
Capital expenditures are stable.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest shortcuts highlight the firm's robust capital spending plan, driven by renewed capacity, and increased investment in robotics and automation to address the labor shortages caused by ageing populations.
A central bank short-term survey shows that large enterprises plan to increase capital expenditure by 13.4% in the current fiscal year ending March 2019.
The previous short-term survey was 13.6%.
Nan武志 said that the planned capital expenditure of all enterprises in this financial year grew by 8.5%, approaching the pace of the Japanese bubble era.
He said, given the small business' upward trend from the earnings forecast now, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditures, but this largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence.
Short-term surveys show that the ability of businesses to transfer costs has improved, and the output price index of large enterprises is positive 7, which is a high point in a decade, an encouraging sign that Japan's efforts to combat inflation have made progress.
The employment rate for large enterprises is negative, reaching a low of 23%, the lowest level since 1992, highlighting the employment market tightening.
Beneficiated by strong corporate spending, Japan's economy has bounced back in the second quarter from the contraction of January 1st this year.
But the escalating summer trade tensions and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have made Japan's export-dependent economic outlook uncertain.
In terms of the US dollar, the growth rate of services imports and exports was 16.4%.
A press release on the Commerce Department's website quoted a head of the Department of Trade and Industry as saying that the total volume of emerging services imports and exports in August exceeded $1 trillion, growing faster than the overall volume.
Of these, the total export volume of emerging services imports was 11,383.9 billion yuan, a growth of 20.9 percent, 10.4 percentage points higher than the total export growth rate of emerging services imports, and the share of emerging services increased by nearly three percentage points.
In terms of service exports, 1 August, service exports continued the rapid growth momentum since this year, with exports outpacing imports by 5.7 percentage points.
Among them, the top three growth areas are telecommunications computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1%, 38.8% and 26.5% respectively.
The head of the Department of Food and Trade also noted that the proportion of services imported in August also increased gradually.
From August 1-8, emerging services imports grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of service imports, up 1.6 percentage points from the same period last year.
Of these, financial services, IP fees, telecommunications computers and information services imports increased by more than 20%, with 47.1% and 23.3% and 23.2% respectively.

Every time I go back home, the changes are very big, and more and more artists are coming out and spreading Chinese culture, and I think this change is very big.
The reform and opening up of our country is certainly a world miracle.
Compared to before, we are now honored to be recognized as Chinese by the Canadian Association of Chiefs.
We are very proud of the efforts made by our country over the years.
China's strong, sympathetic overseas traveler sentiment, as well as many foreign friends, has also expressed admiration.
They also sent their blessings to China, to the Chinese people.
I feel that China is one of the most fascinating cultures and civilizations in the world, and may the friendship between China and the United Arab Emirates flourish for a longer period of time.
Bless all Chinese people, for you are wonderful.
In China, you helped me, and I hope you are well.
Make the world a better place, as you are doing now.
When I met new Polish friends and told them I was learning Chinese, they would say that you must have a job and you would be right.
In fact, that's what it is, China has developed particularly well in recent years, which makes me happy.
Happy Chinese People's Day!

The 69th International Space Conference is opening in Germany.
The 69th International Space Congress (ISS) opened on October 1st at the BLM Exhibition Centre in Germany, attended by more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and businesses, experts and young students from around the world.
In a speech at the opening ceremony, the president of the International Space Federation, Jean-Yves Lezgal, said that global space affairs no longer involve only a handful of countries and institutions, with a sharp increase in attendance this year compared to the previous one, indicating that more and more institutions and individuals are joining them.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation, and to promote the development of space and space.
Zhang Kzhong, deputy minister of industry and information technology at China's Ministry of Industry and Information, director of the National Space Agency, presented China's space program during the exchange, and said China would expand international cooperation in space, contributing to human space affairs.
Related agencies such as China Space Technology Group, China Space Technology Group, and representatives of some private companies attended the meeting, which showcased the latest achievements of China space, including various types of launch rockets, satellites, and space technology applications.
The International Space Congress, held annually since 1950, is the largest event of the world aviation community.
The five-day conference was jointly organized by the International Space Federation, the International Academy of Space Sciences, the Center for Applied Science and Microgravity Research at BCHM University, and the International Space Law Society.
Reuters Beijing, November 5 - A press release from the China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday said that the general meeting showed that China's foreign trade situation is still complex and dire, with 80.6% of enterprises expecting a better or even year-round export situation in 2018.
But given the continuous increase in the cost of domestic raw materials, the labor force, the external environment that is increasingly affected by China-US trade friction, the exhibitors also consider the export situation to be unopposed next year.
At the press conference closing the 124th General Conference, Vice-Secretary of the General Conference, Press Spokesperson, Vice-Director of the China Foreign Trade Center Xu Xie said that the number of foreign buyers to the number of participants and the export turnover of the current General Conference were relatively small.
This year's procurement was attended by 189,812 buyers from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11% from the previous year.
Exports were made of 2,064.94 billion yuan ($298.6 billion) which is down 1% from the previous year.
From a market perspective, trade between Japan, the ASEAN countries, and South Korea grew by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5%, while for other traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada, and the European Union, trade declined by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3%, and 0.8%, respectively.
From an industry perspective, transportation tools, machinery, building and decoration materials, electronic consumer and information products, toiletries grew 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6%, while textile clothing and home appliances fell 13.0% and 6.7%, respectively.
Xu Xiu said that as a sign of the Chinese foreign trade trend, the current GCC purchaser and buyer attitudes and export trading data indicate that China's foreign trade development next year is still facing a lot of uncertainty.
But with the profound advancement of supply-side structural reforms, and the recent introduction of policies in countries and regions, China's foreign trade development is gaining momentum, and the diversification of enterprise markets is making continuous progress, which are important foundations and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
 Comprehensive factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade imports and exports will remain steady throughout the year, further improving the quality and efficiency of the product.
China's General Customs Administration announced that, in US dollars, the September export-to-export growth was 14.5%, the import-to-import growth was 14.3%, and the September trade surplus was $31.6 billion, which was the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade tensions between China and the US, China's September export performance still far outpaced expectations, the booming foreign demand, the fact that companies have been raising exports before the US imposed tariffs, the overlap in the exchange rate of the yuan, or the main supporting factors, also show to some extent the strength of China's foreign trade, but the Chinese-American trade war is a blow to confidence, the impact on the industrial chain is unbearable, and analysts believe that the challenges to China's foreign trade may be apparent in the fourth quarter or next year.
According to a Reuters investigation, the US Treasury's manager suggested in September to increase cash holdings, continue to maintain a cautious stance, as the US and China began the latest round of import tariffs, and there are no signs of easing the dispute.
But according to the recommendations of the 12 fund managers involved in the survey, the North American asset allocation increased to its highest level since June 2017, while the UK, the euro area and especially emerging market holdings declined.
The global share allocation ratio averaged 56.6%, the bond ratio 35.5%, and the overall survey was basically consistent with last month's survey.
The most noticeable change is that the cash dividend ratio has risen to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager at a large fund company said, "Some economic data have given confidence to the market, but trade war is still the biggest concern, so it's best to be prepared to enter when the market drops".
But the fund manager still preferred stocks in September, especially U.S. stocks, even if U.S. stocks were considered price-preferred.
Today, at China's open landmark in Shanghai, the world's first major import-themed national exhibition ― China International Import Fair ― officially opened amidst the public's anticipation.
An exhibition is like a window that allows the world to get to know a city and a country better.
Through this window of opportunity, we see people moving toward a higher level of China's opening up; through this window of opportunity, we welcome the world to a mutual win-win relationship with China's reform and opening up and re-emergence.
 For a country, opening up is like a broken butterfly, which, although it will experience a moment of pain, will be reborn.
General Secretary Xi Jinping summed up the Open Road, highlighting an important reason why China is so powerful.
Looking back on 40 years of reform and opening, China, which dares to enter the world market, despite the pressures and the waves, always faces all the risks with an open attitude, continually releasing its internal vitality, continually improving competitiveness.
It can be said that China, with its own achievements, has powerfully interpreted the values and meaning of openness.
Standing on a new historical starting point, organizing an import-themed expo, was a major decision taken by the Party Central with comrade Xi Jinping at its heart to advance a new round of high-level open outdoor activities, was a major initiative of China's initiative towards a world open market, was a practical action by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization, demonstrated China's strong and clear will not to close the open door, but only to open it wider and wider.
The list of exhibitors from the countries is a dynamic, dynamic, and challenging list, which is the greatest affirmation and best response to China's open economy in a broader, broader, and deeper context.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has come to a crossroads.
Some countries are building high walls of trade protectionism, backing the old path of unilateralism, increasing international concern about the prospects of free trade, and adding to the uncertainty of the warming global economy.
In such a context, the event in Huangpujiangzhong, reflected China's defense of free trade, the world's ability to see open markets, and China's shared confidence and responsibility for the future.
Go fast alone, go far away.
China has opened its heart, embraced the world, not only promoted its own development but also brought China's opportunities to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the co-operation of the road, launched the launch of the Asian Investment Bank, established the Silk Road Fund, provided a range of international public products, provided real-world export markets, opportunities for development and jobs, and enabled companies to join China's development.
The Expo is also such a public product, a global platform for economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions, with high-quality products and services of all kinds, have taken a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to the national enterprises, domestic consumers are also the ones who really benefit.
By building this platform of excellence, we have provided a multi-channel quality supply for consumer upgrades, meeting the personalized, diversified, and differentiated consumer needs of the masses.
As China's doors open, the bigger the doors, the more solid the steps toward a better life will be.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the economic and trade spheres, but instead looks to the future, spreading the idea of openness, inclusiveness, inclusion, inclusion, balance, and win-win, and forming a common understanding of today's challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to, and hope that the Expo will bring to the world beauty and fulfillment; we also aspire to, and move towards, a higher level of open China, where we will work with the world to build a bright future in which the community of human destiny will be a community.
Foreign media: The United States has reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States, and the United States imposing tariffs on cars that are not currently produced in Canada.
According to a foreign media report, a Canadian source revealed late on September 30th, local time, that the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement was reportedly to include Canada opening its dairy market to the United States, and the United States imposing tariffs on cars that are not currently produced in Canada.
On August 27, the United States and Mexico announced that they had reached a preliminary agreement on the renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the United States, extending the negotiating period to September 30.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign a favorable agreement, focusing on substance rather than timing, and that we would continue to negotiate, hoping to reach an agreement that would be in Canada's national interest.
More than 90 percent of Brazilian women voters said that the presidential candidate did not consider women's needs.
According to South American news website, the recent data released by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) shows that over 90% of Brazilian women do not think that the presidential candidate takes into account the needs of women.
Currently, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million, and if all Brazilian women are brought together to form a single country, the country's population will rank 13th in the world, more than twice the national population of Spain.
In Brazil, women constitute 52% of the total voter turnout, while men make up 48%, although the proportion of women among voters is very high, in the Brazilian Congress, the proportion of women is only 10%.
Out of 193 countries worldwide, Brazilian women's participation in politics is ranked 154th, higher than the Arab world.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women still fail to achieve the rights they deserve.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that this phenomenon is the result of the ancient patrilineal society, racism and the shared values of capitalism.
 Political origin should be based on nationalist protests for civil rights, identity, access to public goods and the formation of several social groups in the same society. But the politics of Brazil belong to a monopoly of some group, and the majority of the population is not represented.
A previous study by the Brazilian Institute of Motor Vehicles (Locomotiva) also found that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that politicians in elections represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women disagree with politicians' decisions, and 93 percent disagree with current government policies.
 We need to reverse the problem of underrepresentation of women in parliament, Brazil's political system is still affected by inequality. To date, there is still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil's political sphere.
Despite the lack of women's rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
Polls show that 76 percent of women believe they can play a role in democratic elections, and 72 percent of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to reduce discrimination against women.

With growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets largely uninspiring, the United States is increasingly becoming the main driver of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container freighter was docked in a port in New Jersey, USA.
But since the current growth in the United States is driven by tax cuts, which have been a source of financial stimulus for a long time, the economy of the United States is also under intense scrutiny from the outside world.
As the United States is recovering full employment, economic downturns are inevitable.
He said the only question was when it would happen, and in his opinion, it might only happen in advance or afterwards.
Although Barkley is optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook for the year-end, the bank admits that it is more difficult to predict longer periods of time.

Its importance not only because of its importance to corporate profitability and consumer purchasing power, but also because of the pay jump or inflation that could cause the Federal Reserve to worry officials.
Salary will be of great concern, as it is likely to rise sharply again from the previous month.

On September 29, China's first 3,000-ton large cargo ship was sunk by a Chinese gunboat group at the Yangtze River.
Once completed, the ship will break through the equipment bottles currently in China's major floating-point, submersible-sealing, recycling, and plunder-searching safeguards.

Influenced by typhoon, strong winds continuing in the harbour pool, maximum winds even reaching 24 knots, the launch signal delayed from 30pm to 1pm by almost 90 minutes, wind speed still not seen a drop, match referee Anne Mdrand announced the cancellation of the first day of competition, postponing the race to 1st October afternoon.
The strong winds blowing from the shore continue to blow, and the sea is indeed too strong.
Mdrlander explains:  In such a situation, no one knows when the wind is blowing towards the racing boat.
 The nearby city stadium, given the current wind conditions, cancelling the race was the wisest choice 
There is still a certain disappointment for all the crew who are ready.
The racing boat is ready to dock, and our condition is fine.
Qinghai player Max Richardsen says:  But I know that the game reschedule was the right choice, and hopefully today's wind power will be less, we can stretch our hand.
Omega Wilkinson, the star of hope for the New Zealand team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said: "Loss of a day's time made the game even more interesting.
Because today's match will be a bigger one, and there are only two days left to play.

Despite the continued global financial market turmoil, the Hong Kong Financial Administration said Monday that the foreign exchange fund's investment income in the third quarter of this year decreased by 97% year on year, but performed better than last quarter, due to the high overseas stock flows and sharply shrinking foreign exchange losses during the Sino-American trade war.
According to the latest data from the Gold Administration, the foreign exchange fund recorded investment income of 1.6 billion in July-September 2018, down significantly from 61.8 billion in the same period last year, but well above the revised 100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Zheng, president of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, told the legislature that at the beginning of the Sino-American trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes were at odds with the U.S. stock indexes, and after the U.S. stock market index continued to peak from late September to early October, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the United States itself.
Changes in market sentiment are good, but if the trade war is only one-sided, it will not help much to resolve the situation.
But he also pointed out that if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise.
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund's loss on Hong Kong's stock investments in the quarter narrowed 8% to HK$4.7 billion, while its foreign exchange earnings increased by 172% to HK$12.8 billion; foreign exchange losses of HK$16.2 billion, bond earnings of HK$9.7 billion, decreased by 24% and 31% respectively, reflecting mainly the general rise in the dollar as the main currency during the quarter, and the US interest rate in September rose by a whopping 3 cents.
The foreign exchange fund is mainly used to support the port.
Hong Kong has been implementing a link exchange rate system linked to the dollar by the port since 1983.
 For the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen said, the economic and asset market uncertainty increased, downside risk increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is stable, well defensive, and has ample earthquake resistance.
Hong Kong has a rich international investment position, with a net foreign assets of $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, more than 2.5 times Singapore's and 0.6 times Japan's, and needs to cope with the downturn or reverse period.
Recently, the interest rate decline has continued to decline and the interest rate spread with the dollar, Chende pointed out, the exchange rate price of the port on September 21 had risen by over 400 basis points, the market generally believes that it is mainly related to the increase in interest rates of the port, followed by the decline in interest rates of the port at a level near 7.80-7.84, until recently the decline in interest rates of the port continued to decline, with the dollar interest rate expansion, which may attract market interest rates to buy the dollar increased interest rate activity, which again triggered the weakest opportunity to exchange collateral for a larger period of time than before.
But he believes that as the interest rate cycle of the Hong Kong Bank begins, and the interest rate on the port normalises, the future situation of the interest rate on the port below the dollar rate will change.
 The interest rate on the port and the trend on the interest rate on the dollar will be more consistent, we must manage the risk more carefully, prepare, and deal with market fluctuations 
Because of the abundance of capital in the port, the interest rate breakdown further declined, with the three-month breakdown falling 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, with the dollar interest rate spread from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the monthly breakdown reached a new five-month low, and the dollar interest rate spread from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From mid-May to mid-September, the port currency exchange rate was close to $7.85zh1 for most of the time.
During the period, due to factors such as the outflow of some of the proceeds from the sale of shares after the completion of the interest rate and large-scale public offering activities, the weak party was triggered several times in May and August, after the first round of guarantees was triggered in April.
The Bank of China is buying and selling USD at 7.85 levels in accordance with the contact exchange rate system, to maintain the stable exchange rate in the port.
The Bank of China bought about H521 billion in May and August under the Weakened Persons Guarantee Scheme.
Is the new tax law still beneficial to foreigners?
When asked by the journalist, the relevant head of the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Office said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing to provide preferential arrangements for people abroad, including people in Hong Kong.
A reporter asked, the newly amended personal income tax law makes it possible for taxpayers who are resident in our country to be assessed by a taxpayer's standard from one year to 183 days.
Please ask if, at the next stage of the implementation of the law, there are still preferential arrangements for overseas persons, including people from Hong Kong?
The person responsible responded that the current regulations for the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Law provide special preferences for foreigners in the matter of taxation, and that individuals who have no residence in China but have lived there for more than one year or less, and whose income originates outside China, can only pay personal income tax on part of the income paid by the individual or entity in China.
The official said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing to provide preferential arrangements for people abroad, including people in Hong Kong.
There is no such thing as a "moon" center: quality certification promotes quality improvement.

At the same time, to meet the needs of the new generation, from early wound care to mid-to-late-moon care, to services such as beauty care, to provide care programs such as Chinese medical beauty treatments, to help us recover our physical appearance.
A newlywed resident of Zhongzh told reporters that she had only booked a month or so in advance for this lunar branch.
The services provided by the monthly membership program directly affect the comfort and physical recovery of the mother during the monthly period, some small monthly memberships can only provide some simple monthly services, there are no sanitization regulations, easy cross-infections, dietary unpredictability, and so on.
The head of the lunar center said they were the only one of all five-star lunar centers in Tianjin city to receive a B-grade service certification.
 While some customers do not understand the meaning of Tier B certification at first, certification is important for the long-term development of the company by pushing enterprises to a strictly standardized process management, benefiting customers, and making it more efficient.
Panlifin, deputy director of the certification department of the National Agency for Market Regulation, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, focused on the quality management and satisfaction of the organization's service characteristics, is an important part of the national quality infrastructure, plays a positive role in improving the quality of service delivery ratio, enhancing China's international competitiveness in services.
Starting in 2004, after more than a decade of development, the service certification program has gone through a process of gradual development from nothing, emerging a series of influential service certifications such as financial services certification, maternity and child care certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, healthcare service certification, and so on.
According to the National Central Market Regulatory Agency, there are currently more than 130 service certification bodies in China, more than two thousand service certification personnel, and nearly eight thousand valid certificates.
Panlifin said that further guidance and promotion of the development of service certification should be given, gradual expansion of service certification coverage in health, education, sports, finance, e-commerce, and other fields, and foster service sector supply-side reform and quality improvement.
Hong Kong's housing prices have fallen for two consecutive months after peaking, with Hong Kong Financial Administration President Chen Zhengwei on Monday saying that it is still time to see if the housing market has entered the downstream cycle, and if confirmed, a tightening policy on further relaxation of reverse-cycle measures can be considered at an appropriate time.
Chen said that if the price of buildings were to recede, the first people affected would be the people who were unemployed at the peak of the housing market, but that there would be a sharp drop in housing prices during the 1997 Asian financial storm, which greatly reduced the chances of citizens to sell their property.
Chen Deong, head of the multi-national Gold Management Board, said in a briefing session of the legislature that if it is confirmed that the housing market has entered a downturn cycle, further relaxation measures can be taken when appropriate.
 But now we see only a few weeks of data, relaxation is still early, it will still be more time to see if the housing market enters the downward cycle 
Since October 2009, the Gold Board has introduced eight rounds of reverse cycle measures, drastically tightening the mortgage rate on all types of property, including lowering the number of mortgages, requiring mortgage applicants to undergo rigorous pressure testing, and so on, to improve bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
With Hong Kong officially entering the interest rate hike cycle, the September 8 private housing price index for the entire city of Hong Kong has fallen to the top for two consecutive months, and the monthly fall in September has expanded further to 1.44%.
But this year's cumulative increase in the three quarters of the year was still 10.2%.
According to the Gold Board, the household financial situation of Hong Kong's financial risk-bearing capacity is still healthy, with households in Hong Kong having a 66% homeless household ratio in the second quarter of this year, up from an average of 60% in 2009-11, and the average number of new loans and new loans with a supply and interest rate of 47% and 34%, respectively, significantly improving from 64% and 41% in 2009-11 respectively.
But Chen said that high earthquake resistance does not mean that already unemployed citizens will not be affected by the downturn in the economy, as property valuations will fall, and those who buy buildings at peak times will take the lead.
While the Federal Reserve is tightening the banking credit limits on mortgage lenders, the homeowners can also get high-yield mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or through the provision of mortgage loans by developers.
Chen said that, along with mortgage loans to developers, borrowers now take out mortgages of up to 85-90 percent, and if the price of buildings drops by a tenth, negative assets will appear, i.e. the market value of real estate will fall below the level of the total unpaid mortgage loan.
However, the Vice President of the Gold Management Bureau, Zhang Heng, noted that the authorities estimate that the development partners provide a high percentage of the total mortgage, accounting for only 2 to 2.5 percent of the total bank mortgage, which is still low.
At the peak of Hong Kong's negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the total supply.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong has recorded zero-negative assets for seven consecutive seasons.
On October 1, the e-commerce retail exporting enterprises launched another wave of tax and profit on the value added tax, excise duty and other issues.

Systemic scarlet fever is a chronic suspected disease of the body's entire genital tract, which in the past was considered incurable.
It is not cured due to its unknown mechanism of disease, doubtful diagnosis, lack of effective treatment.
Recently, a team of researchers from the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University, Zhangri, and the director of the Center for Rheumatic Immunology at Beijing People's University Hospital, Kastong discovered that human immune globulin has a molecular variant that increases systemic red-spot sensitivity, and that variant is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, both teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is a major cause of systemic red blood cell disease.
According to Sun Xiazhong, one of the authors of the article, of the Northeast People's Hospital, the team of the Khrushchev team collected and studied nearly 2,000 large samples of systemic red-spot lupus patients, and found that patients with immunoglobulin variations produced pathogenic cells and a wide variety of autoantibodies, which significantly increased the incidence and severity of inflammation, such as inflammation, arthritis, meningitis, vascular inflammation, etc.
Through a variety of research methods, including immune cell tracking, animal testing, sequencing, and so on, the team discovered the immune signaling pathways that activate this immune molecule variant; promoted B cells' pathogenesis mechanisms of multiple autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams, working together, fully exploited their respective strengths, achieved a close combination of basic research and clinical applications.
The Whanli team is dedicated to B lymphatic cell immunoidentification, immunoactivation research, and the Kastongchi team is dedicated to long-term clinical research into systemic red blood cell disease.
 This study is one of the results of many years of collaboration between two teams, and for the first time in the academic community recognizes mechanistically that immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic red blood cell disease, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical therapy 
This is not a shortcut, but a legal action.
A lawyer carrying an axe to the court?
The news was indeed exciting, and it exploded in the legal arena.
The Fuzhou City Council subsequently fined the lawyer involved 500 yuan, and recommended in writing that the Fuzhou City Bar Association conduct an investigation.
According to the Xinjing newspaper, the official press release of the Law Society of the City of Quanzhou said that the actions of the two lawyers were not illegal, and that they were not punished under the law.
According to multiple reports, the management of the Quanzhou City Law Association is not about shortening or fighting, but about getting the approval of the Quanzhou Central Court.
Together, events that could have triggered tensions within the legal community were eventually properly resolved.
The reverse is the result of a more complete truth-based approach: the axes of the lawyer involved and the accused's murder weapon, the same type, but unlabeled, only as supporting evidence in the context of the evidence, and without the subjective idea of intimidating or jeopardizing the security of the court.
To determine whether the lawyer involved had violated the law, there are four very important details that need to be considered: first, the local court has only shown the photo of the axe at two previous hearings, from a defensive perspective, showing that the original material of the axe was necessary; second, the axe was not to be purchased until an hour before the trial, and the lawyer was not unwilling to seek the judge's consent but was objectively unable to contact the judge; third, the entire axe was not overused or improperly used; fourth, the lawyer first publicly admitted the error and apologized to the court.
Taking these facts together, it can be seen that the lawyer involved was not involved in the proceedings, but merely in defense.
After clarifying the whole matter, the Quanzhou City Law Commission did not go ahead with the matter, but instead, under pressure, made a decision that did not impose punishment.
This decision, however, also passed the test of fact and law.
As for the unlicensed, unlawful delivery of an axe to the court as a control tool, it is indeed easy to cause unrest and misunderstanding.
For safety and prudence reasons, the Central Court of Kuanzhong has not yet issued any recommendations for fines and judicial sanctions.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers, prevent individual courts from owing lawyers, the Supreme Court issued the Judicial Police Safety Inspection Rules of the People's Court in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct personal safety inspections.
Since the rule was issued, the general counsel has been a rule of thumb, and there have rarely been incidents of security breaches that have jeopardized the security of the court.
In very individual cases like those in Quanzhou, misunderstandings are easy to eliminate as long as they are communicated with respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as an autonomous organization of the legal profession, has the dual mission of punishing unlawful conduct and securing the rule of law.
In the past, individual law organizations have suffered from a predilection for punishment, lack of security, and severe illness.
The decision of the Quanzhou Law Society, whether in the process or the outcome, is commendable, setting an example for more law firms to properly practice.
From October 1, what tax advantages will affect our money bags?
The new personal income tax law, which will come into force on January 1, 2019, to allow the general public to enjoy tax deductions as soon as possible, will, from October 1, deduct previously earned wages from actual income of taxpayers based on starting points of 5,000 yuan per month and apply to the new tax rate table.
With the fall of the new regime, what benefits will affect the money pockets of the masses?
Interest rate: The tax deduction on wages is significant.
Taxpayers who receive payroll after October 1st can deduct the basic deduction of 5,000 yuan/month and apply the new tax rate table, and most taxpayers have different tax deductions, especially for middle and low income earners.
According to the tax-deductible status chart for different income groups, the monthly income after deduction of 8000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, 500,000 yuan, the amount of tax deductible after deduction of 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, 9090 yuan, and 3500 yuan at the beginning of the month, the corresponding tax deduction ratio was 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0% and 18.8%, respectively.
It is worth noting that, due to the holiday season, wages that were due to be paid in October by the end of September, according to the law, could be applied to the new basic deduction of fees and tax rates.
To this end, the tax department's uniformly promoted use of deduction account software has provided the corresponding tax calculation feature, but the corresponding tax payments still need to be filed within the statutory tax return period.
Interest rate 2: The low tax rate grade gap is significantly widening.
In addition to the increase in starting points, the new tax rate schedule will apply from October 1.
The seven-tier tax rate on wages and salaries, as previously agreed, has not changed, but the tax rate range has changed significantly, the three-tier tax rate range of 3%, 10%, 20% has expanded significantly, the 25% tax rate range has been reduced, while the 30%, 35%, 45% tax rate range of these three-tier tax rates has remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusted the tax rates on income from production operations, with the lower threshold of the top 35% tax rate being raised from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual business owners, individual joint ventures and individual companies will all benefit from the tax reform.
 From the standpoint of the individual tax deduction of Shanghai taxpayers in the past, the broad taxpayer will fully feel the dividend of individual tax reform, especially the significant tax reduction for middle and low income people.
According to Ramin, head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai City Tax Office of the National Tax Administration.
The third benefit: Tax service is easier to optimize.
Since the introduction of the new personal income tax law, the Shanghai City Tax Department has undertaken a series of comprehensive and broad tax campaigns.
On the one hand, policy advice on the priority tax sources, the priority enterprises, and the implementation of one-to-one, one-to-one, one-to-one policies.
The Pudong New District Tax Office has previously visited large enterprises such as Apple Trade, Shanghai) Limited, China) Network Technology Limited, Red Star, and China's Kylong Housing Group Shares Limited, which have a large number of employees, large volumes of work, large amounts of taxpayers, and the tax department's active consulting and answering questions; the Xu Wei District Tax Office has visited large labor enterprises in the region, including China Zhi Financial Consulting Limited, China Zhi Shanghai Economic Technology Co-operation, and others, collecting business concerns, responding to business requests, and solving business difficulties.
On the other hand, the taxpayer as a whole should be given a full, multidimensional, and metric tax policy.
Using the official website of the Shanghai Taxation Office, the WeChat Public Number, the WeChat and other channels to push policy hotspots in a timely manner, ensure policy advocacy is in place.
At the same time, from September 28, Shanghai tax office Weibo launched 12366 smart consulting platforms, through the AI+AI tax consulting service, to conduct a smart integration tax reform publicity service.

The trilateral trade agreement between the two countries will open up new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to a foreign media report, a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Lethizer, published on the Canadian government's website, said that the United States, Canada and Mexico had reached a trilateral trade agreement, which will be known as the USMCA  (US-US Trilateral Agreement).
Earlier, Canadian broadcaster CTV News quoted senior US sources as saying that Canada and the United States had eliminated their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post reported, citing two sources familiar with the situation, that the September 30 agreement between the United States and Canada would retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a trilateral trade agreement, and the three heads of state would sign a new agreement within two months.
The statement said:  Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed to a new trade agreement ― US-Mexico Trilateral Agreement  (USMCA), US-Mexico Trilateral Agreement that will provide our workers, farmers and companies with high standards of trade, which will promote a freer market, fairer trade and more sustainable economic growth.
The North American Free Trade Agreement was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After Trump announced his inauguration as president, plans were made to reconsider the agreement and sign a new one.
The three countries began this negotiating process in 2017.
The results of the Okinawa governor's election, which was held early on the morning of 1 January, due to the death of former governor Aung San Suu Kyi, were announced early on the morning of the same day, and Yugeng-deni, who opposed the plan to move the US military base to Japan, was successfully elected.
The election was held on September 30, with the final results showing that Yūshū City won a total of 39.663.2 million votes, making Okinawa County governor's election the most voted in history, more than its main rival, Zōjiji-ku, with 80,000 more votes.
A total of four candidates contested this election, with a turnout of 63.24%, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa County gubernatorial election.
Yuzhikin told the media on July 1 that the election results showed that the people of the county did not want to let the governor's lifetime of efforts be wasted, that he would inherit the governor's estate, and that he would continue to work with the Japanese and American governments against the plan to move American military bases and the closure of the space base.
The U.S. military base in Okinawa County, Yanozhou Bay City, has been suffering from illness, the Japanese government previously agreed to move it to the Nakano-gu, but Okinawa residents strongly oppose, hoping to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
As for the relocation plan, which was strongly opposed by the county residents and the demand to revoke the license to build seaports along the Kenzo-gu coast, Yūshū said that he did not initially take a stand against and split with the central government, hoping that the two sides could fully exchange views, showing the intention to resolve the issue through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe Jinsun-ji told the media on the morning of 1 January that he would take this outcome seriously and would work to revive Okinawa and reduce the base load.
Japanese official Zhengwei Wei, speaking at a press conference on 1 January, said that the government's policy on moving US military bases as soon as possible has not changed.
At the same time, he also expressed hope for talks with Yuzh Zhizh.
Yūshū will officially take office as Governor of Okinawa Prefecture on 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, with China's growing demand for oilseeds, farmer Paul Thomas of North Dakota, USA, has grown more and more soybeans on his land.
This shift reached its peak this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, reaching an unprecedented size.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to replant the main crops of the U.S. agricultural region before 2019: corn and wheat.
This year, U.S. farmers have grown more soybeans than corn for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for the planned transfer of other crops is that in the context of US President Trump's trade war with China, American farmers selling soybeans are in trouble.
China typically buys about 60 percent of U.S. soybean exports, but because of the trade war, the recent months of almost zero U.S. soybean purchases have led to soybean prices falling to a decade-low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to do more by reducing the reliance on crops that depend on China's demand.
Thomas said the price of soybeans has hit us with a heavy blow.
He said that, without China's buying and selling requirements, soybeans near its farm are currently priced at $7.10 per ear, while the cost of coverage is $8.50.
U.S. farmers have hit record highs this year in soybean cultivation, and harvests are expected to hit record highs this year.
Just at a time when they were so vulnerable, they were hit by a trade war.
China imposed tariffs on imports of US soybeans in July against Trump's Chinese imports.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release the first forecast report on next year's planting area, which will include considerations of the impact on tariffs.
 This estimate is expected to confirm the public authorities' expectation that the area of soybean planting will be reduced 
According to a report seen by Reuters,Informa Economics on October 19th predicts that the area of corn planting in 2019 will increase by 4% to £92.7 million, while soybean planting will decrease by 7% to £83.0 million.
Informa also expects the area of wheat plantations in the United States to increase by 4%.
The area of soybeans grown before the retaliatory tariffs increased this year to £89.6 million, up from about £15 million a decade ago.
The area of corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million pounds since 2008 to 89.1 million pounds, and this year the area of wheat cultivation was 47.8 million pounds, near the lowest level in 100 years.
Aaron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, has a total of 3,600 acres of land, almost half of which he will spend this year growing soybeans, but plans to cut back in the future.
He said his farm in northern Illinois may increase the area of corn plantation by as much as 20 percent; the state is the largest soybean plantation in the United States.
Soybeans per pound are less than the unit production of corn, but they also require less chemical fertilizer, which makes soybeans generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers switch to end-value corn, it may increase costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Anderson Inc.'s fertilizer vendor.
Anderson's CEO Pat Bozhwe told Reuters he expects replanting corn will be beneficial to the use of chemical fertilizers.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from farmers' turnover of corn.
The director of the Bangkok Garoon Management Board of the Bangkok Airport, Satzh Thilawa, held a meeting on 29 May, apologizing for the incident at which a Chinese citizen was attacked at the airport, and said Thailand welcomes Chinese visitors, the relevant authorities will strengthen management, raise awareness of services, and prevent similar incidents from occurring.
On 27th, security at the airport of Guangzhou reportedly clashed with a Chinese man who was denied entry.
Sintilava said the security-related conduct was a serious breach, the airport administration suspended him, and established a procedural commission of inquiry to investigate the matter, as to whether the situation was indeed resigning the security.
Currently, the Thai Immigration Service has arranged for the man to fly back to China.
Sintilava apologized for the incident, which damaged Thailand's image, and said that Thailand attaches great importance to the incident, is willing to do its best to reduce the impact of the incident on the tourists being beaten, and will send an apology to the parties through the Chinese embassy in Thailand.
He said that Gangman Airport is willing to facilitate Chinese tourists visiting Thailand, and that together with Thai Immigration Agency, the five major international airports in Thailand, including Sivannap, Gangman, Chiang Mai, Pujie, and Hoi, in Bangkok, Thailand, will establish a special entry corridor for Chinese tourists.
He said the next step for the airport administration would be to renovate the landing zone, clarify landing fees, and improve staff's service quality and communication skills.
After the Chinese Embassy in Thailand learned of the incident, the first contact with the parties was made, understanding the situation had gone through.
At the same time, the Thai Immigration Service, Airport Authority, Tourism and Sports Department has submitted a request for interception, requesting the Taipei Tsetsucha incident, the strict punishments of the perpetrators, and will continue to communicate closely with Thailand, deal with the matter properly, defend the legitimate interests of the parties.
China's international timeline: defending multilateralism, China's knowledge of the world
In a time of unilateral reversal, international rules and multilateral order are undergoing a shock.
To some extent, the intersection of unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible power, China, with its strong and firm stance on the concept of the Sunan Shij-Haw, will work with the international community to uphold multilateralism and promote its continued progress.
Faced with new challenges, China has made a strong voice about the direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Secretary and Foreign Minister Wang Zheng said in his General Debate Address to the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, the new era of multilateralism should be stepped up to a win-win cooperation, rule-based order, fair justice-based, and effective action-oriented.
At the same time, China calls for a global development cooperation framework to be built with the United Nations at its core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, and South-South cooperation as the complementary framework, and calls for all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflects the mainstream voice of the international community.
As the 73rd President of the United Nations, Espinosa, has said, in the current situation, the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism, maintain a rules-based international system.
International Monetary Fund President Lagarde said the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of global economic and political forces, the emergence of some emerging markets and developing economies, which play a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms, has provided new developmental impetus for the multilateralism that is facing the wind.
Standing up for this dimension, China's advocates of building big families instead of jigsaw circles, insisting on co-operative co-operation rather than winning-win-win-win, conforming to the trends of the age, is the inevitable choice to face global challenges, solve world problems, represent the common demands of most countries in the world.
With more advanced ideas, more robust action.
China's proposed 一带一路 initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform of its kind.
China's initiative to co-create international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, 16+1 Cooperation, promote international regional cooperation, complement existing international institutions and order, give innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation, and contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's action on the UN's multilateral stage is becoming increasingly powerful.

As the UN Secretary-General Guterres has said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
As the global trust deficit intensifies, as populism and polarization rise, the world's most pressing need for multilateral cooperation is at a moment.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to work together, turn consensus into action, firmly defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of a community of human destiny.

The fifth month of the Disability Voice is coming  Focus on the issue of disabled adolescents' sexual education - China News Network
In recent years, the topic of adolescent sex education in China has been widely discussed, but the challenges for disabled adolescent sex education remain tough.
Recently, a comprehensive education challenge and practical strategy workshop for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to provide sex education to children and young people with disabilities, became a major topic of discussion at this seminar.
The report on sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of children with disabilities and adolescents published at the meeting in China showed that the proportion of children with disabilities who suffer sexual harassment or sexual assault is higher than healthy children.
Social attention to disabled children, adolescents, and others is also increasingly focused on sexual protection.
This seminar aims to explore the three aspects of family support, school education, institutional services in China: promoting inclusive education for children and adolescents with disabilities, providing support to children and adolescents with disabilities from the source, giving them the right to enjoy love as they do others.
 Experts believe that, since then, the Chinese public's awareness of disability has remained on an insufficiently deep level.
Influenced by factors such as traditional ideas, China is not yet deep enough in the comprehensive education of people with disabilities, especially children and adolescents with disabilities.
But in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public interest groups, the practice and path to achieving a full-scale, comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education for people with disabilities in China has developed considerably.
 Reports  show that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical disabilities have more difficulties than the general population in gaining access to sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationships, but in general have developed towards facilitation and enrichment 
 Seminar on Comprehensive Education Challenges and Practice Strategies for Disabled People organized by the Shanghai Humanitarian Fund, the UNESCO Representation in China, the International Disability Alliance (France) Beijing Representation, the United Nations Population Fund in China, and jointly supported by the Health China Grand Strategy, aimed at discussing the full cycle of comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education for disabled people, and at developing pathways, promoting special education and integration education policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents, and other stakeholders on behalf of the international comprehensive education policy and the health rights of disabled children and youth; and broadly exchanging practices, strategies, challenges and resources on domestic disabled children and youth, and on how to develop and develop comprehensive education for disabled children and youth in the future, developing blueprints
路透北京9月30日 - The Central Bank of China on Sunday released data on the forecasted short-term outflows of foreign currency assets, showing that as of the end of August this year, the central bank's foreign exchange position on long-term contracts and futures contracts for the currency was zero for 12 consecutive months, with no positions remaining in the month.
The Central Bank's previous data showed that as of the end of August last year, the central bank had a total foreign currency holding of $60.44 billion in foreign currency futures and futures contracts, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the size of the SDRs (special withdrawal rights) was 42.76 billion SDRs.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange-backed position has remained zero.
The central bank first released the data in late March 2016; data showed that at the end of February 2016, the central bank's foreign exchange position was $24.38 billion, the empty position $28.9 billion, against the long-term contracts and futures contracts of the central bank.
The first time the September data released at the end of October of the same year showed an increase in net air cargoes of $1.64 trillion to $4.53 trillion.
The central bank had previously stated that the long-term and long-term positions of the central bank in foreign exchange against the central bank mainly reflect the long-term foreign exchange operations conducted by the central bank with commercial banks to meet the needs of foreign exchange securities firms, will continue to provide long-term hedge products on a demand basis, and the long-term operations of the central bank will have less impact on the future size of foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20th of this year, on K158 trains, Jo, a high school student in Zhejiang, took a ride to the Wall.
One of the big guys on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: zh zh zh 
Two hours into the train, the trainmaster advised him to stay for an hour.
Eventually, a male passenger with the same car could not see the lift.
From a political point of view, although the end result is that the majority of the people condemned the perpetrators, punished by the public safety administration, and even blacklisted, the public still feels unable to resolve the issue: why not punish the perpetrators on the spot?
Why can't we stop her immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but punish her after the fact?
And how is it that the unreasonable behavior of the big man is only brought up by a male passenger who is uncomfortable on the road?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with passenger guards, while short-distance trains generally do not; even with passenger guards, passenger guards are more concerned about the possible unreliable reaction of the passengers without taking forced evacuation measures.
The recent events of the Zhongshan caused people to realize that the people who were there had to be forced to leave or even punished to play a role in the shaking.
This requires that our train passengers dare to take vigorous measures in a timely manner, that trains without passengers should deploy passenger police as quickly as possible, to ensure timely stopping and combating of violations.

Reuters 4 November - The British Daily Telegraph reported on Sunday that the UK's Brexit Minister, Dominic Raab, privately demanded the right of the UK to leave the Irish border after three months to secure arrangements.
Rab, reportedly, made the request to Simon Coveney, Ireland's deputy prime minister and foreign trade minister, at a private meeting in London on Tuesday.

At 8:05 a.m. yesterday, two suspects were arrested while stealing from the 20 Route bus station to the Pearl City bus station.
Two thieves tore the passenger's coat pockets, stole $800 in cash, and had the police stationed nearby arrested.
This is the first case of theft that Beijing police broke into during the National Day of China.
Just after 5 a.m. yesterday, the Beijing Public Security Mechanical Investigation Command team responded to detectives arriving at their designated location.
According to past experience, places with high traffic, bus hubs, bus subway lines, including Tiananmen Square, are the main areas of their work.
In the crowd, the police officers calmly observed the crowd passing by.
At over 7am, detectives guarding the bus station discovered two suspicious men following a male passenger from the Yongting Gate bus station on Route 20.
In the car, two suspicious men left and right, putting a male passenger in the middle, one of whom tried to hide from the other.
But they didn't know, their own actions had long since fallen into the eye of the overlooked Benzhou police.
While waiting for the man to take the steal, the police were staring at the man who was about to take the steal, and were caught by detectives immediately after they had taken the steal.
A Beijing Morning newspaper reporter saw that the police seized 800 yuan in cash from the suspected thief.
The money was taken from the passenger clothes.
The police pointed to a broken coat pocket and said: "They tore it apart, stole 800 yuan from a traveler who came to Beijing, and when we caught them, the money was just packed in their own pockets".
The reporter learned that in order to arrest the two men, the police had to wait an hour to finally get a hold of the case.
Two suspects are currently undergoing a police review.
The question of who among the crowd is suspect is simple for the police.
If you catch a thief and catch more, you will find that their eyes, theological and ordinary passengers are different, in addition to carrying people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to drill into the crowd, rather than hide from people.
The police also told reporters that the suspects' cars often have no purpose, they like to wander around the station, find stolen objects and then follow them into the car.
 These are all the words of experience, how long has it been, you know, naturally.
In addition, the police also suggested that putting out clothes is the most convenient, and also the most likely to be stolen.
When driving to play, be careful of your belongings, lest they be stolen.

Activate rural consumption, clean up markets through normalization mechanisms, drive healthy consumption demand, and increase farmers' sense of consumer availability.
According to data, the consumption potential of rural residents continues to unfold, with retail sales of rural consumer goods growing 10.5% in the first half of this year, and growth above the towns by 1.3 percentage points.
In a poor village in a western county, the whole village has only one convenience store, the store is open, some goods are known as 金龙鱼, 旺仔 became 旺奶, 山寨, and many other goods are available.
In recent years, similar phenomena have been repeatedly exposed, some rural counterfeit goods are branded, names are similar, packaging is similar, false, and unreliable.
A consumer survey report released in a western city showed that the problem of counterfeit goods is serious for rural merchants, with 66% of users having bought counterfeit goods in the supermarket below the town line, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant sector is fixing the rural market, year after year, why is Li Gongzhong still not satisfied?
Unlike urban markets, farmers' rights awareness is relatively weak, coupled with many remote rural locations, being in blind areas where regulatory power is insufficient, allowing counterfeit goods to grow in soil.
One product is multi-purpose, some are departmental, some are production, some are pipeline markets, functions are crossed, year after year, centralized governance is a blow, fake is hidden from the wind, and then slowly emerges, just finished, new is emerging.
Lack of long-term regulatory mechanisms, difficulty in cleaning rural markets, low cost of illegal activity, high profits, have caused some illegal trade to wreak havoc in the upper and lower countryside, some rural areas to become waste markets.
From humid to well-to-do, large farmers are moving towards developing consumption.
A few days ago, the Central Committee of the Party, the State Council, issued several opinions on improving the mechanism for promoting consumerism to further stimulate the consumption potential of residents, including proposing to promote a gradual upgrading of consumption levels in rural areas, with the aim of making large numbers of farmers consume energy, willing to consume, and willing to consume, so that rural consumption can truly flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reforms, eliminate market regulation policies, eliminate the many management disadvantages, make land available, strengthen food safety, monitor product quality, and constantly squeeze rural manufacturing and sales space.
On the other hand, to increase law enforcement, to regulate the circulatory system, and to prevent the spread of fake fake news in rural areas.
Strictly punishing farmers is the only way to protect farmers, no matter how much fake people hide, should not be the reason for the fake goods being produced, the relevant authorities should clarify their responsibilities, the regulatory power of the underlying sector should be reduced, which sector is in trouble, should be held accountable, and the fake people should be kept out of hiding.
Strictly restrict market access, strictly review the eligibility of production operators, keep the market circulation, allow products to be repaired, cleared, come from the source, think of a solution, allow legitimate dealers to operate safely, allow farmers to buy safely.
Activate rural consumption, drive healthy consumption needs.
With the rise of consumption, many farmers not only seek to eat well, but also to pursue a high-quality life, such as culture, health, cannot compare the rural market with the low-quality, cheap, etc.
This requires promoting e-commerce to expand to wider rural areas, promotion of two-way sales channels, promotion of online industrial development platforms and e-commerce platforms, support for consumer business model expansion to rural markets; promotion of conditional towns that integrate commercial logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc. In order to strengthen rural modern transportation network systems, optimize integrated storage facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural transportation costs.
To create a clear, secure market environment for rural areas, to make farmers consume without concern, to make rural consumption more and more profitable, to enhance the sense of gain, of happiness, of farmers' consumption.

Canada's GDP in July grew 0.2% from the previous month, a higher-than-expected increase, warming the market's expectations for the Canadian Central Bank's interest rate hike next month.
If the rate increases are effective, it will be the central bank's fifth rate increase in a little over a year.
Analysts at the Reuters site had previously forecast growth of 0.1 percent.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries in Canada have achieved growth.

The first joint expedition into the Hanjiang port of Haizhzhong in the Korean War began in 1965.
The South Korean Ministry of Defense confirmed on 5th that the Korean People's Republic had launched a joint expedition to the waterways of the Hanjiang and Linjiang rivers that day.
The initiative is an early preparation for the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
According to a press release issued by the South Korean Ministry of Defense that day, this was the first joint survey of the Hanjiang port of entry by both sides since the signing of the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement.
The Korean government signed a military agreement in September this year, and it was agreed that from November it would jointly explore waters such as the Hanzheng port of entry, to ensure the future environmental protection of the area, tourism development, and so on.
In October, the Korean dynasty planned a joint survey of the waters during a general-level meeting.
On November 5, the joint expedition to the waters of the Korean War officially began.
The Joint Expeditionary Force is composed of 20 members from the Korean War military, experts, and others.
According to the Ministry of Defence of South Korea, during this visit, neither side carried weapons, prohibiting the use of provocative language.
 Because there is no military line near the port of entry, the area was once an accidental high-altitude area, but through joint exploration, the future here will turn into a new peaceful area 
The total area of the waters of this joint expedition of the Korean dynasty, about 70 kilometers long, is about 280 square kilometers.
According to the South Korean Ministry of Defense, South Korea will send six reconnaissance ships to explore the depths of the sea, providing basic information for safe navigation in the waters; pending completion of the investigation, it will provide navigation maps to civilian vessels.
The Korean dynasty held a summit in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on jointly using the Hanzheng and Linzeng rivers as seaports, but subsequent talks were shelved due to tense conditions on the peninsula.
According to the Korean War's military agreement signed in September, future ships of both sides will need to notify each other in advance before navigating common waters.
