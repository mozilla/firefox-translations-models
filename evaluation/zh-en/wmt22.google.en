Zhejiang University&#39;s Annual Academic Conference: Students Play the Leading Role in Research Results That Make People&#39;s Minds Open - Xinhuanet
Use the air to wash your hands, breathe hard to diagnose diseases, and accurately search for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of imaginative academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these results are students, and their research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with applied value. , some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biosensors: Your home medical doctor
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor on site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
&quot;You only need to take a breath, and this set of instruments can initially detect your health status from the components of the gas you exhale. &quot;
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after the breath is exhaled, a health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material, whose targets are chemical elements. Its keen &quot;smell&quot; allows it to reflect the body&#39;s health status more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent surgical lights: high-powered eyes for doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver medal at this year&#39;s 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students in the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas amidst the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
&quot;The failure to detect and remove many diseases in the early stage is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room. &quot;
Shen Junfei said that for example, during early cancer screening, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue clearly in time, the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four lamp panels that adjust the spectrum to enhance the distinction between different tissues under light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadow-free rate at any time according to surgical needs and personal habits.
This smart surgical light has been trialled in Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Children&#39;s Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
The invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup last October.
Washing hands with air: saving water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer. However, Li Qizhang and other students invented an &quot;air hand washing device&quot;.
As long as we stand on the sink of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
“It’s like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean! &quot;
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands through this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to be driven by our own gravity, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world&#39;s top universities and won the only gold medal.

A certificate that I find very meaningful - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skill certificates that I think is important besides my driver’s license!
To popularize it: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue when an emergency occurs, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, four golden minutes!
So how important it is for people around you to understand first aid!
When someone falls around us, we can use professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing there motionless and unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is too scary.
“In China, our official data is that three million people die from accidents every year, and the most dangerous one is called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 70% to 80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%. &quot;
This is what Lu Le, founder of First Response, said.
If a person suffers cardiac arrest, has no breathing, and no heartbeat, pinching him or her will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are required to save the person.
I find that very few of us have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens, it will be too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can be in time when facing emergencies. react.
Maybe it can even save someone’s life!
You can sign up for the first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. There are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is to record the goals I want to achieve before I turn 25. I added the first aid certificate to my goal list a few months ago, but I have indeed completed it!
Then I’m going to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving first aid certificate on Xiaohongshu before. To take this certificate, it seems that you need a first aid certificate before you can take the test. So in fact, the first aid certificate Still very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#
Among them, just one shrimp dumpling costs 13 yuan! ?
untested
Why don&#39;t you write #NAME# clearly?
One costs 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed the meal delivery, so this time I only got one shrimp dumpling for me! ?
Because when I entered the code before, I saw that it was valid.
Let me talk about the conclusion first. I personally think &quot;Four Seas&quot; is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But if you want to say that this movie doesn&#39;t have a single highlight, it doesn&#39;t mean that at least the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one kind makes you fall asleep soundly in the cinema, and the other kind makes you filled with righteous indignation after watching it. &quot;Four Seas&quot; is like the monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, it can use countless Ways to ignite your anger.
Han Han is really talented when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creature from a Christian novel. It is indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Brother Ma.
Even after watching it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor hidden by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you will find that it is actually a piece of shit.
Let me briefly talk about some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, where he lives with his grandmother.
Her grandma has a wish to see snow, and the plot arranges for an old man from the neighborhood to drive her in a minivan to see the snow in the Northeast.
An elderly man riding in a van from the south to the northeast to watch the snow? ?
He and his father were very relieved about this.
Then the old man stopped talking.
How did the heroine&#39;s brother get a business license when he opened a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the gangsters on the island’s speedster gang close a mountain road so easily? ?
Then the truck delivering steel bars was parked on the side of the road, and not even the truck driver could be found around.
The prop feel is too obvious.
Why would a gangster with no credit and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn&#39;t you call the police when faced with loan sharks? In the movie, the police specifically asked if you were having any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn’t know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to sit outside the room and sleep all night without being able to find the hotel owner?
This inexplicable plot is present throughout the film, and is so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
In addition to the plot, what&#39;s even worse is that the main theme of the movie, or that the movie has no main theme at all, is a hideous-looking Stitch Monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guessed that it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through the movie, you thought that it might be a drama about the difficulty of survival for young people in small towns. After watching it, you didn&#39;t understand it at all. I don’t know what I saw, and what follows is a deep suspicion of myself. Why would I go to the cinema to watch poop during the Chinese New Year?
Most people are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to film a motorcycle rider, then use inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie achieved success step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, then you should honestly tell the story of the feud between a young man from a small town who likes riding motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot shouldn&#39;t contain anything that goes against the normal world.
(For example, the character played by Yin Zheng whose new motorcycle has just been burned and can still sing), you can&#39;t use some imagination that even Kennedy can&#39;t stand.
As for the heroine, who is clearly not mentally retarded but behaves like a 5-year-old child in some aspects, I really don&#39;t know if this is due to her acting skills or the director&#39;s request.
There is another point that I really don’t understand. As a racing driver, why is Han Han so keen on adding car crash plots in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arranged during the Spring Festival to create trouble for the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well modular brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, and well wall module machinery in China, ranging from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
After years of practice and development, it now has excellent quality and mainly produces hydraulic, mobile, fully automated inspection well series equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment The characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Yixin inspection well brick making machine equipment is widely used in new building materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
Such as: various inspection wells for drainage and water storage facilities, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left and right sides of the modules are all concave and convex groove structures, and the combined masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the shaft wall is much better than that of flat friction masonry.
The modules are hollow structures. After the combination of masonry, the longitudinal holes are connected and the transverse holes are connected. After the hole core is poured, a cast-in-place concrete network structure is formed, which plays a secondary reinforcing and waterproofing role.
The modules are equipped with rib slots both vertically and horizontally, and the horizontal horizontal ribs and longitudinal ribs accordingly increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, inspection wells and drainage wells built using concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, sinking, water leakage, etc. The well wall modules have stable mechanical properties, simple operation, and standard forming dimensions.
The intelligent control of the concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices. One-touch touch LCD monitors the entire process of mechanical operation, realizing ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis and comparison, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system. .
The mechanical hydraulic system of the shaft wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic pressure and transmission, and double-cylinder hydraulic pressure and transmission.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of host vibration on the hydraulic system, thereby ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well modular brick machine equipment has the distribution box traveling and the mold box demoulding and rising, the storage box door is closed, and the pallet is automatically transported. All are completed independently by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well modular brick machine equipment uses imported computers, electrical appliances, seals and hydraulic parts to ensure that the overall performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The shaft wall module mechanical excitation platform is made of integral plate steel, and the table top is wire cut and molded without welding points, allowing the stuffing box to freely swing and guide, fully reducing mechanical wear.
The mold load is reduced, the filler is combined and the vibration amplitude is increased in two-in-one, and the integrated, fully synchronized, table vibration and mold vibration are adopted to ensure the vibration effect is achieved.
The shaft wall module mechanical excitation machinery and computer automatically control the amplitude to adjust the amplitude according to the cost-effectiveness of the raw materials and brake without wear, thereby extending the service life and reducing costs.
The shaft wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing Secondary Vocational School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship System Enrollment is a quasi-employee of the enterprise - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the &quot;modern apprenticeship&quot; talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who receive the pilot training will also have apprenticeship status. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded by the pilot enterprises as Unit employees.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprises should be standardized, and the dual status of apprentices as secondary vocational school students and quasi-employees of enterprises should be clarified. In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who are 18 years old, an agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school and company to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, rights protection, etc. of the apprentice&#39;s on-the-job training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for corporate employees with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools must reform their talent training models.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, corporate master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot is based on the training academic system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the company is determined according to the professional talent training plan. The post-job internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 municipal-level secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches. Each pilot has about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of piloting first and then implementing, and gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises to effectively improve students&#39; job skills and improve students&#39; counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

I have been thinking about this vacuum cleaner for a long time, and finally cut the grass ruthlessly. The vacuuming effect is good. There is obviously much less dust in the house, but it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand. Wet mopping needs to be improved, and there will be dust marks when taking it off back and forth. Overall, I am very satisfied.
The food processor is quite heavy, looks tall, and is suitable for a novice in the kitchen like me. My kids say it tastes better than cooking it myself. I have cooked two meat and two vegetarian dishes, and the sweet and sour pork ribs are especially delicious. The longer the cooking time is, the more time it takes to cook the other items. It’s short and makes very little noise, so you don’t have to worry about frying it or not being able to cook it!
After receiving the goods, I couldn&#39;t wait to fry three dishes at noon. Technology has really changed my life. The control of heat and seasonings is extremely precise. The taste of the dishes has been directly upgraded to the level of a chef. Yes, it is a magical tool for those who are not good at cooking. Recommended to buy!
I added a new addition to the kitchen.
A smart food processor that automatically adjusts the heat and stir-fries.
No longer need to worry about being scalded by hot oil, no longer need to worry about not controlling the heat well and causing the vegetables to become burnt or undercooked.
The stir-fried dishes are much more delicious than what I cooked. The scrambled tomatoes and eggs are particularly delicious, and the eggs taste particularly good.
This pot is well worth the purchase.
The stuff is good, worth buying, very good
Overall it&#39;s very good, very clear and consistent with the description.
worth having.

South African doctor: Although Omicron is highly contagious, most symptoms are mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physician organization of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, reported that the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating all have mild symptoms, such as physical Flu-like symptoms such as aches and coughs.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization&#39;s director, said he sees dozens of patients every day but has not yet had any need to be hospitalized.
&quot;They were able to control the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation,&quot; Pillai said.
That includes older patients and those with existing health problems who would otherwise be at greater risk of severe illness from coronavirus infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, during the previous wave of the Delta epidemic, the COVID-19 patients he treated “had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within days.&quot;
In the two weeks since the Omicron variant was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences.
While it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors&#39; observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in recent weeks have severe symptoms, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of epidemics; the average length of stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; the recent COVID-19 Only 3% of patients died, compared with 20% of cases in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Institute, said: &quot;At this point, almost all indications point to this being a milder form of the disease. &quot;
He added: &quot;It&#39;s still early days and we need to get later data.
Typically hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we&#39;re only two weeks into this wave. &quot;
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case counts and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant strain of the coronavirus worldwide, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, Gauteng saw a 400% increase in new cases in the first week of December, with tests showing that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today’s supporters, all 80 boxes have been given away!

Education Commentary: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we compare it to the famous public service slogan &quot;No buying, no killing&quot;, then in a good environment where there is no demand for &quot;trafficking&quot;, mass prevention and collective governance, and nationwide anti-trafficking will make trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly. If it is high, this kind of crime will not happen frequently.
Recently, an emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Anti-Human Trafficking Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for releasing information about missing children and to find abducted children in a timely manner.
When I heard that this app was called &quot;Reunion&quot;, I suddenly felt warm.
New technological means not only have a &quot;literary&quot; name and are full of emotions, but they are also properly used in information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second step is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment ranges from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, and there are many &quot;big words&quot; that can be listed.
However, before a trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the victim&#39;s personal safety.
Matters are prioritized, and under the urgent purpose of &quot;finding rescue&quot;, controversial and controversial topics such as &quot;whether child abduction and trafficking should all be punished by death&quot; can be put aside for the time being and discussed with caution; but matters such as rescuing abducted children, etc. No.
Based on the experience in investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to moving away from the crime scene as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the kidnapping operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be further away from the parent, and the difficulty of detecting the case will increase.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with effective methods such as the &quot;Reunion&quot; platform that directly help solve cases and recover children.
After all, &quot;anti-trafficking&quot; is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
Combating crime and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents require the implementation of &quot;protecting young children and supporting the weak&quot; from the improvement of legislation to judicial protection and rigorous law enforcement.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better from families to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three was resting at the train station. The parents were asleep, and when they woke up, they found that the child was missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Taking turns to rest between parents, or placing the child under safe protection, are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police&#39;s crackdown on abduction crimes, the party who purchases abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to my country&#39;s &quot;Criminal Law&quot;, the statutory starting point for the crime of child abduction is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it may be punished by death and property confiscation.
The starting point for punishment is high and the maximum punishment is severe. Under the general trend of &quot;light punishment&quot;, the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
However, many trafficking cases still occur every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and have weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the &quot;market&quot; for trafficking is widespread, and traffickers are motivated by profit and constantly innovate trafficking methods, resulting in a &quot;fighting with law enforcement&quot; situation, the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into inefficiency.
Therefore, getting rid of backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of child trafficking and bribery.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing and filtering to remove foreign matter.
It can be divided into three levels according to different acidity:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
It has an excellent taste, with an elegant and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
High-quality virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, and the taste is pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or becomes &quot;secondary oil&quot;.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to blend the taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5% and it is transparent and light golden yellow.
Refined olive impurity oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): It is an olive oil extracted from the oil pomace through a dissolution method and refined.
If you have read the grade classification, you should have discovered that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruits are just like grapes for making wine. Olive fruits from different producing areas and different olive varieties will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best places to grow olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation required for the growth of olives.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. have similar climates to Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. in far southern latitudes.
Olive harvesting months:
From March to June every year, the olive tree blooms and sets fruits. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature. The fruits transition from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The fruit picking season is from November to February of the following year (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
Nutritional facts of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils discovered so far.
Democracy summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The online &quot;Summit for Democracy&quot; convened by US President Biden and attended by governments, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global &quot;Democracy Summit&quot; next year.
Taiwanese government representative and political councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
&quot;We know how difficult the job ahead of us is,&quot; Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I have said before, and as this summit shows, democracies are everywhere in the world.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the small flame of freedom that burns in the hearts and minds of people around the world. &quot;
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said: “As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, and achieve transparent and accountable governance that is more resistant to the buffering and impactful forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to serve in the public interest. People who have been nakedly pursuing power before. &quot;
The themes of the second day of the &quot;Democracy Summit&quot; are to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and confront authoritarianism, as well as counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with the &quot;International Human Rights Day&quot;.
United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech that day that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said: “Now is the time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, tackling inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution. &quot;
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China&#39;s ethnic minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: “For too long, the world has accepted the rise of China without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything (resources) we have to ensure that the resurgence of democracy is our top priority. &quot;
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
He said: “Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don’t want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don’t recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that&#39;s why we fail.
This is why we must change. &quot;
While attending a roundtable discussion on &quot;Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming the Value of Democracy,&quot; Taiwan Executive Yuan Political Affairs Councilor Tang Feng released a &quot;National Statement&quot; via video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of fighting autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: &quot;At a time when Taiwan&#39;s democracy is in the ascendant, we have always been firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and we have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere have justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy has shown signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without closing the city, and we can defeat disinformation without removing it from the shelves. &quot;
While the second day of the &quot;Democracy Summit&quot; was underway, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and other countries that have been found to have seriously violated human rights. Surveillance technology assists Chinese companies that abuse human rights in enforcing investment restrictions.
I have taken pictures and uploaded them to you
I knew.
But the restaurant doesn’t know why it keeps delaying delivery times
It turned out to be #NUMBER#
Then I won’t scream anymore.
Stop eating
I will definitely complain
If you can&#39;t deliver it, why didn&#39;t you tell me earlier?
Waiting for you for so long
No, I didn&#39;t receive the call

Why not cancel
Hello, the saliva chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to stick with it, so I wanted to find a place to practice at a similar price first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can&#39;t tell the difference, then the expensive racket will normally be friendlier than the cheap racket. This kind of &quot;entry racket&quot; is actually industrial garbage.
Their strength is very low. When the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. The hard ball cannot withstand it, and it is difficult for experts to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so difficult, I know you can&#39;t learn it, and I know you are not willing to buy expensive ones, so I will make a cheap one to fool you. If you play it twice, you will not play again. This way This racket is cheap and you won’t feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Then come to me and buy something expensive, and I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price and buy a better second-hand racket, choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets cannot be sold at high prices. A new one is 500 or 600, which is very good. A second-hand one is very good. 200 yuan, wouldn’t it be nice to have a thousand yuan shot?
It&#39;s friendly to novices, but it becomes useless once you pass the novice stage. But most people, especially girls, can&#39;t get past the novice stage.
The order has been delayed several times
Could you please help follow up?
put off
Thanks
That is to say, I actually already have credit?
Do I need to place an order again next? Doesn’t that order need to be ignored?

In fact, there are a lot of things to pay attention to when it comes to dressing for girls who are slightly fat.
Skirts worn by fat girls should not be too short or too long. The length should be almost at the knees and just enough to cover the fat areas of the thighs.
A skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on your legs.
If it is too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling.
If you wear it divided into three sections, the upper, middle and lower sections, it will appear that you are naturally taller. That is, using different colors for the upper body, skirt and stockings will give you a slender look.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are standard for fat girls (the author knows this very well). Dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat. Noble and elegant black short skirts are also the first choice for fat girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black skirts, will make you look thinner.
If your calves are chubby, don&#39;t draw too much attention to your socks and shoes.
The more popular the better, and the colors shouldn’t be too bright.
Avoid making people look fat when they draw attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly fat, we must tell you the tips on how to dress well.
Fat girls must not wear tight short skirts. In addition, the tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which will make people look very uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black stockings or mesh stockings (thin ones). The plaid one), choose a printed flared skirt with a soft texture and match it with a blouse with a swung collar, which can well cover up the shortcomings of a fat girl.
Of course, fat girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
If a fat girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a top with the same color as the skirt. This will increase the height of your fat figure.
Pairing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender. This is the most IN style in summer!
If you are a girl with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous dress and short skirt.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can also show off your advantages.
A-line short skirts are very slimming and are more suitable for fat girls. Choose tighter tops to create a layered look and make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt can also be tried by fat girls.
Fat girls can also look fashionable.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing and matching, fat girls will also be the center of attention.
After making changes in dressing and matching, you should also exercise more in your life, and try to get rid of the label of a fat girl one day soon😄

Girl serves as an archery target to raise funds for her sister: &quot;It&#39;s okay considering it&#39;s just a flesh wound&quot; - Xinhuanet
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words &quot;Human target, ten yuan for an arrow&quot; written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of &quot;A Hangzhou girl volunteered to be an &#39;archery target&#39; to raise funds for her sister&quot; went viral on WeChat Moments.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person in Wulin Square in Hangzhou. The words &quot;Human target, ten yuan an arrow&quot; are written on the wooden board, indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows to shoot after paying.
This behavior caused heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the publicity director of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an extreme move to raise funds for her sister. However, this behavior is not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl He left the local police station yesterday.
Girl gets admonished for raising money through &quot;shooting target&quot; on the street
In the picture posted online, a girl with long hair is standing in front of a large wooden board with the words &quot;human target, ten yuan per arrow&quot; written in black ink. On another wooden board in front of her, It has its bank account and WeChat, Alipay account, etc.
The picture sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believed that this was an &quot;attention-grabbing act of begging,&quot; and many netizens sympathized with this.
&quot;We discovered the situation when we patrolled to the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd. At that time, there were already a lot of onlookers. &quot;
Police from the Tianshui Police Station near the incident site said in an interview with local media that there were two girls setting up the stall, both about 20 years old, and dressed youthfully and beautifully.
Among them, the girl who was the &quot;human target&quot; kept crying, begging passers-by to play this game; another girl was helping and yelling, saying that her friend&#39;s sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery money, so she asked for your help.
&quot;We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister&#39;s leukemia treatment. &quot;
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl’s name was Ji Jiali and she was raising donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, since the treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan, I couldn&#39;t think of a good way to raise funds, so I did this.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for the shooting, but they did not participate. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but some people watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police identified the bows and arrows used by the public security department as not falling within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, “This eye-catching fundraising method is not recommended.”
After receiving a warning from the police station, she left the police station.

People engaged in project management gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of difficulties at work.

The number of PMP certificate holders has been increasing year by year in the past 10 years, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the &quot;old experience&quot; of the past. The ever-changing work environment tells us that we need to learn and stand on the Stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can taking the PMP exam ensure smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and the five major process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when actually doing project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: insufficient understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having no project management theory, and not knowing how to practice it; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement it in work, and project estimates are inaccurate. The control sensitivity is poor, and the project is delayed again and again; the division of labor among members is not clear, and the &quot;old fritters&quot; in the team do not know how to deal with cross-department assistance and communication. It is difficult to advance the project...

A wide variety of red envelopes with full discounts and eye-catching live broadcasts have once again made consumers clamor for benefits. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people lament that the national consumption power is getting stronger, and on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about consumption. The impact of socialism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the &quot;Double Twelve&quot; holiday, Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd.

Generally speaking, Chinese residents perform well in terms of financial consumption, but there are large differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and they need to further improve their basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and &quot;one old and one young&quot; will continue to be the focus of financial education; the &quot;Report on the Debt Situation of Young People in China&quot; released by Nielsen and the &quot;2019-2020 China&quot; released by CCTV Finance &quot;Youth Consumption Report&quot; shows that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation generally shows a rational consumption trend, although It is very different from the &quot;over-spending&quot; label affixed by the outside world, but some young people do engage in excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behavior, which has resulted in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to a gradual increase in social problems. Financial companies should be brave enough to bear Social responsibility and positive guidance.

Vietnam People&#39;s Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council responds to common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#39;s stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed&#39;s first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
Amid the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when various Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward &quot;unity and stability&quot; mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore ties with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states&#39; efforts to resolve their differences and restore relations with Qatar stem from the need to unite for the benefit of each country and regional stability and to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince&#39;s visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land passage between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate travel for citizens of the two countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia&#39;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 cooperation memorandums of understanding worth US$30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince&#39;s visit to the Gulf countries coincides with Iran and world powers fighting to save the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a deal that Gulf Arab states have condemned as unable to resolve the missile issue with Iran. Agreement is negotiated.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term &quot;competitor&quot; and regarded Iran&#39;s nuclear program as a &quot;threat&quot; to regional security.
Gulf states believe that failure to resolve the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iran&#39;s activities in the region is flawed.
In the context that nuclear negotiations between major powers and Iran failed to meet the wishes of various Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia conducted direct negotiations with Iran.
The goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first among GCC countries since the dispute between some members and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

It is said that the exhaust sound of supercars in Xinshan District is the loudest!
This car our team brings to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini’s flagship supercar, the replacement model of Murcielago—Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, and the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgit. It has four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget it, I don’t know. The data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h. It probably means that my myvi has reached 100km/h when it reaches 30km/h. Hmm.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body, and the unobstructed 6.5 V12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret Lamborghini&#39;s style.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model, just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It attracts too much attention. Everyone is watching wherever I go, which makes me feel uncomfortable! (It’s actually kind of cool)
The cost of petrol for 1km is around RM1 (car owners don’t care at all)
You need to practice your posture when getting in and out of the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you will be unable to climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway)
The engine is so loud that you will be deafened immediately after getting off the car. (But it’s still cool)
The car body is too big, and it will be very narrow when parked in a regular parking space. I am afraid that it will be knocked by the car next door when it opens the door!
It&#39;s a bit lonely because there are no rivals on the road (the editor said it himself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don’t get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to take videos of your car, please contact us!

Involved in a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I believe car enthusiasts all know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed a million-dollar sports car 911 and a million-dollar supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Judging from the results, the price makes sense!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits accumulated over a long period of time in the development process of a university. It is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world&#39;s first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For our country&#39;s universities, they emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and their spirit is deeply rooted in traditional culture and changes in the times. The influence of the university advocates the value concept of &quot;helping the world with enlightened virtue, cultivating Qi Zhiping&quot; and the patriotic responsibility of &quot;promoting education and strengthening the country&quot;.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global competition in education, science and technology, and talent are intensifying. As an important &quot;supply side&quot;, higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the &quot;Overall Plan for Coordinating and Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines&quot; not only demonstrates my country&#39;s confidence and determination to move from a big country in higher education to a powerful country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities. .
How can we strive to become world-class in a relatively short period of time, accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines while still having a certain gap, and achieve &quot;overtaking around the corner&quot;?
In addition to being confident in their goals, paths, and capabilities, universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, the latecomer advantage. By continuing to introduce outstanding overseas academic talents and learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, they can achieve academic level and school-running quality improvement. Significant improvement; the second is cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom and connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization over five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands and enhance the image; the third is institutional advantages, giving full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries nature, strengthen goal drive, gather consensus and joint efforts, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate to catch up with the world&#39;s advanced level.
In particular, we must realize that building a world-class university cannot be the same for every school. Each school must demonstrate its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
School-running characteristics must not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal positioning, school-running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting three characteristics in running the school: first, highlighting the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, building an integrated education environment that integrates science and education, and school-enterprise integration, and forming a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; The first is to highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for cross-disciplinary, and actively cultivate cross-emerging disciplines and iconic cross-disciplinary achievements; the third is to highlight the characteristics of the school running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of &quot;Seeking truth and innovation&quot;, the common values of &quot;diligence in study, cultivating morality, discernment, and pragmatism&quot; and &quot;opening up rivers, cultivating true virtues, opening up things for the people, and building up our country&quot; together constitute the The latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running schools, continuously accumulate cultural heights, and gather spiritual strength. It is rich in connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, &quot;Haina Jianghe&quot; emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of &quot;using the talents of the world for my use&quot;, and embodies the high-quality concepts of running schools and educating people in world-famous schools; &quot;Qizhen Houde&quot; emphasizes the pursuit of truth. The spirit of kindness refers to the fact that while universities pursue the truth, they should also receive the cultivation of virtue and the tempering of personality; &quot;opening up things for the people&quot; embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the pursuit of new knowledge, the innovation of scientific research, but also the performance of For the sake of reform and development, reform and innovation; &quot;Building our country&quot; emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and talks about the university should always share the prosperity and disgrace with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the soul of Zhejiang University’s 120 years of operation.
&quot;The wise hear the silence, the wise see the invisible.&quot;
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we must adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, and let the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times, and the national spirit stimulate each other, thereby providing inexhaustible power for realizing national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and realizing the common ideals of mankind.

When NFT is rapidly emerging from the circle, a new concept has emerged in the encryption community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called &quot;Axie Infinity&quot; had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their job opportunities due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in this game.
&quot;Axie Infinity&quot; is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology. It integrates a variety of gameplay methods including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, exceeding US$3 billion so far.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity’s daily revenue exceeds US$8.2 million, which is close to that of “Honor of Kings”.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially stated that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of &quot;Axie Infinity&quot; has passed on a new &quot;palytoearn&quot; model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role. In addition to gaining fun and economic benefits from the game , you can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw a piece of news about a friend’s stock price, my biggest feeling was the company’s choice of track, which refers to the choice of investment target industry. First, it must choose an industry with large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion or more; secondly, We must choose industries with good future growth, and consider industries whose growth will reach the best state in the next 3-5 years; finally, we must choose industries with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
The tactic is to &quot;do the things right&quot;, that is, to do things right.
The strategy lies in &quot;doing the right thing&quot;, that is, doing the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding the direction, while tactics lie in implementation. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen the current field or expand horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve core customers and high value Customer retention rate (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately Recruit new customers; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

Asian-American groups complain about admissions discrimination at Yale and three other Ivy League schools - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd to protest against the ban of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College. Discrimination against Asian applicants during the admissions process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious American schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three prestigious American schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities &quot;continue to and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants&quot; in the so-called &quot;comprehensive consideration&quot; admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in these three universities, relative to the number of applicants, Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants. More than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also hope that the colleges and universities complained against can take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admissions policies for Asians.
At present, the three universities that have been complained have not yet responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in admissions at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, those participating in the complaint also include American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency about a factory building located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province. After many on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a family member of the owner of the building, on the details of purchasing the factory building, and remitted a deposit of 200,000 yuan via bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the &quot;Deposit Receipt for the Sale of Factory Buildings&quot;, which stated, &quot;If the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will belong to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller. Both parties It is agreed that the factory sales contract will be signed within a week.”
However, the two parties later failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of sale of the factory and the method of payment, resulting in the delay in signing the house sales contract.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
After finally settling on the house, the deposit was paid and the payment was ready, but the last step was to sign the contract, but the seller refused to sell it. This made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao People’s Court.
After trial, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract cannot be solely blamed on the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed to be due to the failure of negotiations. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied to this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the liability for breach of contract of double return of the deposit.
After the first instance verdict, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer’s reminder] You must exercise the necessary prudence and attention during the transaction process.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you must exercise the necessary due diligence, such as verifying the owner&#39;s information, whether the house is occupied, and other relevant information, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent the performance of the contract. A dispute arises between the two parties.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the &quot;Democracy Summit&quot; ended on Friday, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the &quot;Leaders&#39; Summit on Democracy&quot; to &quot;draw lines based on ideology. To tool and weaponize democracy, in the name of democracy, it is actually anti-democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and diverting domestic conflicts.&quot;
The Chinese government believes that &quot;for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, implemented &#39;democratic transformation&#39;, indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated &#39;color revolutions,&#39; which have had disastrous consequences.&quot;
&#39;Democracy&#39; has long become a &#39;weapon of mass destruction&#39; used by the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden&#39;s move to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video. Leaders of 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also doubts internationally and in the United States. For example, they criticize that the invited participants include some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the true intention of the Biden administration is not for democracy. The summit was organized for geopolitical purposes.
Newly-appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit
A statement from China&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, &quot;Today&#39;s American democracy is fully morbid, and problems such as money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social divisions, racial conflicts, and the polarization between rich and poor are intensifying.&quot; American democracy is A &quot;rich man&#39;s game&quot; based on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, &quot;As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, and achieve transparent and accountable governance that is more resistant to the buffering and impact forces of authoritarianism. and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the common good.&quot;
He emphasized that democracy should not be taken for granted, &quot;We must continue to renew it in every generation, which in my opinion is the defining challenge of our time. &quot;
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights &quot;face ongoing and worrying challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend it.&quot;
The United States has pledged to launch a year-long campaign following the Democracy Summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the Entity Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
&quot;Let all of us follow through on our commitments and report back next year on the progress we&#39;ve made,&quot; Biden said.
Okay, I&#39;m just afraid he sent it to the wrong address

Tastes great, great meat, friendly service
It’s been a long time since I’ve been to Richang, and the fruit soup is still so delicious and full of real ingredients. It’s my first time to order barbecued pork buns, and it’s the southern taste of soft flour that I love!
The claypot rice has the right balance of dryness and wetness, and the portion is very generous. The signature foil chicken wings are as good as ever, the soup is also good, and the kale is cooked well...
Great taste, warm service and good meat
The old Richang store was also an Internet celebrity many years ago. It has a small building in Dongdan and wooden floors.
You always have to wait a long time to get the claypot rice at the door, and the casserole of the claypot rice is cracked...
I haven’t eaten in Richang for several years. The rise of Cantonese cuisine in various small shops has distracted the customer flow.
It&#39;s rare to get a seat when you arrive at the restaurant. The quality of the food is as good as ever.
Tastes great. Great meat. Great staple food.
Richang takeaway.
[Rice] Meal: This time the dish was a little disappointing.

How to drink Red Label Whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like collecting, some like food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red Label Whiskey is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskeys in various countries, and Red Label Whiskey has won the gold medal in the International Wine Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don’t know how to taste it, it will ruin its mellow aroma.
So how to drink Red Label whiskey?
The editor will give you a brief introduction.
How to drink Red Label Whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whiskey is blended from about 35 kinds of Scotch whiskey. It has a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scotch whiskey. The rich aroma has a sweet and smoky aroma.
The entrance is rich and fresh, with a hint of vanilla and strong smoky malt flavor.
The wine can be served straight over ice or mixed with a favorite drink.
Red Label Whiskey entered the country. In order to adapt to the taste of Chinese people, Red Label Whiskey + Coke or Sprite or Sunkist and other sparkling drinks have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the sour taste, but also bring visual pleasure to people. When added to drinks, they can dilute the taste of wine and change the taste.
Red label whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar cubes (sugar is also acceptable), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The authentic Hongfangwei tastes a bit sour. Adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, while lemon will bring a fresh fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label Whiskey. You can try them as a reference. I hope the editor’s introduction can help everyone.
Educational Thoughts: How to let &quot;students&quot; and &quot;scumbags&quot; find their place in university examinations - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to reflect their confusion about the university exams, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exams and change the types of exam questions so that the exams can truly reflect the students&#39; actual level.
Indeed, college examinations have been a &quot;hot topic&quot; for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world with different ability levels. In addition, with different levels of learning, their learning situations vary widely.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings about the assessment of a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam question type is single, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
Students who don&#39;t study hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating before the exam. If they think of other methods, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is a &quot;strange situation&quot; in which the &quot;student scumbag&quot; can pass the test without putting in effort and even get high scores; the &quot;student scumbag&quot; usually never misses classes, has good homework and notes, and does not do much better in the exam. .
From this point of view, it is not without reason for students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University to report problems in university examinations. I believe this situation is not limited to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I must applaud these three students who wrote straightforward letters.
In fact, anyone who has gone to college knows that it is not uncommon to prepare for exams unexpectedly, find various ways to &quot;coax&quot; test questions from teachers, try to define the scope of the exam, and get &quot;key tutoring&quot; before the exam, even during the exam. It is not uncommon for students to bring cheat sheets and ask teachers for compliments after taking exams.
In the author&#39;s opinion, as a teaching quality assessment guide, measuring whether a university is qualified or not depends more on the teacher&#39;s comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific propositions based on this.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses focus on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether you have a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what the university examination will examine.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the subject and basic common sense. In terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for change and it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, &quot;I learned the basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago. I am still learning it now. It is still the key point. &quot;
However, the knowledge points remain basically unchanged, which does not mean that the exam question types are single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams generally consist of a question group, and senior teachers in the subject coordinate the composition of the test papers. All teachers in charge of the subject also participate in the examination marking, so that the duplication of test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conforms to the actual teaching and learning situation. The questions are normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the students&#39; learning level, so that the test questions can be adjusted according to the difficulty and difficulty. The question types are dynamically grasped, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge test, but also take into account the ability test, and at the same time innovatively design the question types.
Examinations are the baton of university education. Students will have corresponding preparation plans for any kind of examination. If things go on like this, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to students&#39; letters of advice and has deployed rectification plans throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and self-examinations on the course end-of-course examination, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and review links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen the supervision of all aspects of course teaching. Comprehensive assessment.
Mechanistically solving problems such as a single type of test questions and repeated questions are issues that university examination administrators need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the hard work lies in daily life. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. They must not only understand the teaching content thoroughly, It is even more important to have a thorough understanding of students&#39; learning situations, and to understand both sides, teaching and learning will be better connected and form a positive interaction, and the exam will be more realistic, so that &quot;students&quot; and &quot;scumbags&quot; can each find their place.

Mrs. Jin Wedding Photography (South Street Store) does not have a branch yet
Before we took the photo, we had to change the time twice because we had not arranged the time well. Consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to take the photo.
Mrs. Kim&#39;s staff, whether it&#39;s consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all amazing.
That was the first time I officially put on makeup in my life. Wow~ I can’t believe that I will become so beautiful one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry I can&#39;t remember her name) were super patient with their makeup and their makeup was very natural.
The outdoor scene was shot in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was very good that day and it didn&#39;t feel very cold. When taking pictures, the makeup artist kept an eye on our clothes and headwear from time to time. If there was anything wrong, he would immediately help us tidy it up.
The photographer is also very humorous and I felt very happy at the end of the day taking photos.
When selecting photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I didn’t want customers to delete too many photos. But when we selected photos, we really didn’t have any intention of adding photos. There were 24 photos in the direct package. I didn’t add any photos (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time as me added more than 10,000 photos to the package of more than 7,000 yuan. I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many)
The photos were repaired today and Lan Lan sent them to me. I looked at two of them and thought they were not very good, so they immediately helped me repair them.
When I compared the photos my sister had taken before, I felt that I was really satisfied with our photos. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take wedding photos at Mrs. Xuanhan Jin!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful for having you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah had no birth certificate due to shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu News on the 11th) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October. So far, the cumulative number of people affected has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Cheruminus, assured that the information of all babies who have applied for birth certificates has been recorded in the system, and reissues will be issued when the anti-counterfeiting papers arrive next week.
At a press conference, he explained in response to an online media report that there had been problems with the printing of Sabah birth certificates for 10 months.
He said the problem arose two months ago and Sarawak was also facing the same problem.
&quot;One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers that produce special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in shipments to my country. &quot;
He explained that the security paper used for birth certificates in Sabah is different from that in other regions, so stocks from other states cannot be borrowed.
Khairul Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
&quot;The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and they will carry out the final stage of printing immediately after returning to Sabah. It is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicant in two more working days (December 20). &quot;
&quot;We will notify applicants to go to various branches to collect birth certificates. &quot;
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
Waiting until now after 7 o&#39;clock
Is that coming soon?

48-hour nucleic acid negative, &quot;buffer zone&quot; established, the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council issued a document requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus epidemic in port cities, requiring people to leave land border port cities (connected to ports with Hong Kong and Macau) in the near future (Except) Personnel must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and personnel going to land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date when each province, region, and city determines the scope of port cities and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
The relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission’s Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention said that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and residents on both sides of the border have frequent exchanges.
Implementing a differentiated management policy by district, changing from one line of defense to prevent and control spillover into two lines of defense, is expected to move the gateway forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the greatest effectiveness in epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, many local clusters of epidemics have occurred in my country, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this exposed the lack of timely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, the failure to implement closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, the regular nucleic acid testing being a mere formality, the failure to disinfect all links of cold chain items, the irregular management of centralized isolation places, and the epidemic emergency response. Address issues such as insufficient scientific accuracy.
The notice requires efforts to be made in 9 aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the filling of the shortcomings of prevention and control in port cities, and to not relax and do a scientific and precise job in prevention and control work. , Tightly knit the external defense input line of defense.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities must conduct simultaneous research and deployment on epidemic prevention and control and people&#39;s livelihood security, publish and unblock the people&#39;s livelihood security hotline, regularly investigate emerging risks in the supply and price of basic living materials, and promptly resolve and proactively respond to complaints reported by the masses. Outstanding issue.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and municipalities where open land, water, and air ports are located. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) Determine and timely announce according to epidemic prevention and control needs.

The so-called vintage clothing, vintage, and designs all have a retro feel of the era, that is, nostalgia. The reason why I like vintage clothing is because I like its sense of age and texture!

YouTube video reveals the truth about 20 years of bloodthirsty killings by the US military - Xinhuanet
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled &quot;Killing Machine&quot; on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; and forcibly exporting American democracy through the war. For 20 years, it became militaristic, bloodthirsty, killed innocent people indiscriminately, and committed various crimes against humanity.
They abuse drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort human nature, and set up killing squads.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up &quot;black prisons&quot; to subject &quot;suspects&quot; to various forms of torture and personal humiliation.
Crimes against humanity have aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; war &quot;is more counter-terrorist than ever.&quot;
The war did not bring peace, democracy, and hope for prosperity to the Afghan people. It only brought a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let us work together to expose the truth about the bloodthirsty killings in the United States in the name of &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspective of business and shelf life. Although canning is deep processing and does not fall within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, here is the following: Maybe this text explains why the client wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and cans are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
So everyone will definitely ask: Why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of cans is two years or longer?
Or another question: Why is there such a big price difference between cans and bags?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people think that the more expensive ones are better.
Some consumers also reacted after eating out of this mentality and said that the texture or taste of the canned products was different!
Now let me tell you why listening to music is expensive. Why is it so expensive?
Their raw materials are the same, why is the price difference so big?
Because when setting prices, most manufacturers consider that if the bag price is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept it. This means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or there is no profit. So how can manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the pricing of canned products to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote cans rather than bags.
And if you think about it, so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions on advertising every year. Where does this expense come from?
As you can imagine.
With the development of society, market promotion costs, such as sales promotion personnel in shopping malls, display costs in shopping malls, product gift costs, advertising costs, etc. are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are in cans, and their prices are also constantly rising. In fact, these are new products with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, hook up with hospital doctors by hook or by crook, and they will help promote the products and take a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan per can.
China&#39;s relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods of operation. In fact, this approach is harming consumers.
It is recommended that if you have a can at home, you can buy milk powder in bags and put it into the can. This can save costs and increase the storage and sealing properties of the milk powder, which will not have any impact on children.
Also, don’t think that the shelf life of cans is longer than that of bags. If the shelf life of cans and bags is the same after opening, it just means that bags are not easy to store after opening and are prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food was delivered late and the food was cold. After it was cold, it became dry and hard. It was completely inedible.

Don’t scare people away from the starting line - Xinhuanet
When you visit a book market, you can often feel the popularity of success-related books.
Many of today&#39;s success books promote &quot;best principles&quot; - that is, they first assume or imply that you can &quot;do it&quot;, and then tell you &quot;what&quot; you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that the most important and fundamental link of &quot;how to do it&quot; has been surpassed.
Because of this, these books all have a common feature - either do your best in one go, or do nothing at all; either it is 100, or it is 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you simply stay where you are. stay.
Anyone who sees this &quot;best principle&quot; will admit that it is &quot;incomparably correct&quot;, but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of &quot;you have to make up your mind, start a new life, and make a 180-degree change&quot;, and this is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the rules, stick to the past, and refuse to change, if you shout in their ears &quot;You want to change&quot;, you are undoubtedly deceiving yourself and others and playing tricks on others.
Most people will be timid in front of the word &quot;change&quot;, hesitate to move forward, and find it difficult to make a decision; or they may make the decision to &quot;change&quot; based on impulse and take the first step bravely, but it is often a good thing. It doesn&#39;t last long, and it won&#39;t last for a while before it&#39;s defeated. It&#39;s hard to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli&#39;s famous cross talk &quot;Starting from Tomorrow&quot; is a classic that most vividly expresses this &quot;universal human nature&quot;.
The biggest problem with the &quot;best principle&quot; is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people&#39;s abilities, leaving most people &quot;sighing&quot;.
Perhaps, the &quot;second best principle&quot; is a way that may allow more ordinary people to embark on the road to relative success.
The core of the &quot;second best principle&quot; is to &quot;lower the threshold&quot; - it encourages a theory of &quot;accumulating small wins into big wins&quot;, that is, if you cannot achieve 100, you can only achieve 1: because 1 is always greater than 0 ; If you can&#39;t climb Mount Tai, you can just climb the small sand dune in front of your house, because that is better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Since the threshold has been significantly lowered, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persist, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It&#39;s just that the road to success by following the &quot;second best principle&quot; is a little longer.
All in all, although the &quot;best principle&quot; superficially carries the banner of making everyone successful, in the end it can only inspire a small number of people. The &quot;second best principle&quot; can effectively motivate as many people as possible. to benefit more people.

Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserves increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the naked carp resource reserves in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is the same as the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Compared with the initial stage of protection in 2002, the cumulative increase has been more than 40 times.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as &quot;Huang fish&quot;, is a rare fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays a decisive role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the &quot;water-fish-bird&quot; ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale human hunting and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake dropped sharply. In 2002, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the &quot;Red List of Chinese Species&quot;.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a lake closure for fish cultivation, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial breeding and release, cleaning up the main rivers entering the lake, and designing scientific and reasonable &quot;fish passages&quot; to continuously increase protection efforts, Qinghai Lake&#39;s naked carp resource reserves are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that so far, nearly 180 million naked carps have been artificially propagated and released in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The Sanjiangyuan region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in my country and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued fishing ban notices in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, establishing a &quot;one river, one river, and one lake&quot; &quot;Comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

The restaurant only gave me one bag and I had to put it in the bag because it was cold.
I would like to ask, is the takeout packed in a bag?
we only see a bag
I want to know if it was missed or if someone took it from us, thanks
It&#39;s been an hour and it still hasn&#39;t been delivered.
I just saw an article about menstruation. It’s too long.
Let’s give some popular science to men who don’t know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period sometime between the ages of 13 and 15, and experience amenorrhea around the age of 50.
From now on, I will come more regularly once a month as long as I am healthy.
But it’s not so regular that it can be accurately predicted. The tolerance is about a week or so, so you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes bad luck will overturn the situation (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some people have a week; some people have less bleeding, and some people have heavy bleeding; some people have no reaction, and some people are so painful that they are taken away by ambulances. The dysmenorrhea will become worse over time. Change, just because it didn&#39;t hurt before doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t hurt forever.
My menstruation is uncontrollable and I bleed 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end. All I can do is use sanitary napkins or tampons to absorb the blood to prevent it from bleeding onto my clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen at the beginning of the menstrual period before dysmenorrhea can effectively relieve the pain of that month. Taking ibuprofen after dysmenorrhea has started is of no use.
Before the menstrual period, it is easy to have diarrhea due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If you have diarrhea for no apparent reason during your period, your period will usually come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary napkins every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria will easily breed. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case scenario is to change sanitary napkins 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you include the preparation in advance, there may be 50. tablets, not one tablet every month.
(Modify here, you don’t need to change tampons frequently, you can change them about once every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormones during the menstrual period may cause you to be irritable, and during ovulation you may also be emotionally unstable due to changes in hormones in your body. It’s just unlucky that your body will set you back.
However, official crime rate data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions and do not use emotional problems to make excuses.
The bleeding is not just blood, it also contains the shed endometrium.
The endometrium is the thinnest after menstruation, and then gradually becomes thicker. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. The house is built every month (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests. If the guests do not come, they are all dismantled (menstrual discharge). A new house is built every month, and the cycle starts again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, you have to bleed 24 hours a day for several days every month, and you also have abdominal and back pain. Who would want that?
But a person can be born because his mother has menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare you for the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should be grateful to their mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things for women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into saying they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was it, but times have changed.
If some people think menstruation is disgusting and the preparations made by a woman’s body for giving birth to life are disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and stop thinking so. You have never experienced it before and you will never do it again in this life. Men who have experienced and don&#39;t know much about it, don&#39;t be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can you be embarrassed to face your own mother with this attitude, and how can you be embarrassed to want your own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, they are really useful.
Today is the winter solstice festival, so it’s disappointing to get the wrong delivery.
Need to order additional meals for the children
I hope the store will check out the products during their busy schedule.
My feet are numb after soaking in the footbath. Is it due to a leakage of electricity?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can play a very good role in foot care. Today, the editor of Gome will answer this question, hoping it will be helpful to my friends.
As people&#39;s awareness of health care increases, foot bath basins are becoming more and more popular among consumers. A large number of products of different grades have emerged on the market, with a wide range of foot bath basins ranging from more than one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a wide range of products. A lot of room for choice.
According to relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health-care appliances such as footbaths are hot in sales. However, there are no special industry standards for footbaths, so there are certain safety risks.
&quot;It&#39;s really dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!&quot;
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in the soles of his feet when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the footbath. Unexpectedly, after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried it with an electric pen and it actually lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the footbath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant&#39;s attitude was pretty good. Even though the footbath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he discovered that this long-popular foot bath now has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the maximum temperature setting, what kind of people it is suitable for, and what materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, footbaths will not have electrification problems, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly inspected before leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a split foot bath when purchasing.
Water and electricity are separated without any safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take a test pen at will.

Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers will have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens will rise sharply.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of companies that were authorized to use the &quot;Hunan Black Tea&quot; trademark. Xinhua praised the &quot;Source of Hunan Black Tea&quot;.
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant took a fancy to a high mountain tea called &quot;Bingli Chun&quot; and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhun, secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but looking at the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
Xinhua black tea has a touch of red, injecting the connotation of tea culture. It is very popular and popular, and the Hunan tea industry is welcoming a new spring.

Ding Zilin: To my friends.
I would like to sincerely thank all our friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after our relatives were killed. Especially since I personally issued an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, the humanitarian assistance has not been interrupted so far. Rescue.
Nowadays, the parents of most of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, started families, and are employed.
It is your righteous deeds that have helped our families get through the most difficult moments.
The COVID-19 epidemic is currently raging around the world, and most of the donors have retired.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop making humanitarian donations to our victims - the Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, friends, please understand!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Industry News: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the International Federation of Self-Government and Self-Government Services (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the American Independent Federation and the Minnesota Foundation for Chinese Democracy are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.
(Apple Daily photo: The Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by Taoye.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Relief funds often fail to reach the families of the victims of June 4th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, the &quot;Tiananmen Mothers&quot; established a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the &quot;June 4th Orphans Education Fund&quot;. After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF then established the &quot;June 4th Orphans and Special Needy Households Relief Fund&quot;, which has been implemented to this day. .
The funds for these projects mainly come from campus and social donations during the June Fourth Movement, from generous donations from individuals, and are supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
It was not until last year, after 31 years, that the families of the June 4th victims finally received a portion of the donations from Hong Kong raised in the name of June 4th.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding’s decision to stop June 4th donations was out of consideration for the donors. It is true that we are all retired elderly people and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his “to a friend” letter.
We will respect the decision of the victims’ families and terminate this project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those brave comrades who have been generous and risking their lives to deliver humanitarian relief funds for many years.

Thank you very much for choosing our products. Please take 5 minutes to read the following carefully before you use our chips:
After unpacking, please check whether the goods are complete.
If there is anything missing, please contact customer service in time.
The upper cover of the microfluidic chip is made of PC. Do not introduce solvents that chemically react with PC.
Do not use a hand push syringe to inject samples directly into the chip, otherwise leakage may easily occur.
Microfluidic chips with ordinary substrates are tested with pure water at an injection pressure of 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) before shipment.
Glass-based chips pass the pure water test at 800mbar (100um channel) injection pressure before shipment. When using glass-based chips, please be careful not to collide with sharp objects, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
During use, please consider the viscosity of the solution and do not exceed this range, otherwise it may cause leakage.
For microfluidic microchips with ordinary substrates, under the condition that the syringe pump uses pure water to inject samples, we recommend that the flow rate be set below 150ul/min, and the oil phase flow rate is recommended to be set below 50ul/min.
Please increase your flow rate parameter value from slow to fast based on the actual viscosity of the injection liquid.
After completing the experiment on the universal chip, please clean the internal channels in time, otherwise it will easily cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for a long time.
If the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation, it will not be returned or exchanged.

Thank you Rabbit for your review. I originally said that rejecting ancient style is not suitable for ancient style. I didn’t expect that the finished product turned out to be so beautiful.
Thank you Dandan for your recognition. Your satisfaction will keep us fully charged and move forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great and I highly recommend it to all my friends!
From reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production, everything was impeccable.
The makeup artist is very meticulous and will match your makeup to suit your style. The cosmetics used are all top brands.
Not to mention Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens playing with it.
We work in Beijing, and the better studios in Beijing require you to queue up half a year in advance. A colleague of mine filmed in Beijing, and after watching the finished film, I thought it was just so so.
I specifically searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and I think this is also the short version of most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-design, an excellent team.
When the film came out, we and the people around us were full of praise.
I have already recommended it to my best friend, and she was just as happy after seeing the film.
I hope that this kind of studio will not be buried, and more people will discover it and shoot pictures in their own style instead of being the same.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews of Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. They are both very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as customers like it, we will try our best to complete it. Thank you for meeting us.
Sweet and considerate assistant, lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting, an unforgettable experience, and the effect of the shooting was much better than I imagined. Thank you for your hard work. It&#39;s very nice. Thank you everyone😘😘
Thank you Xiaoyu for your review. Meeting you is also a kind of fate. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, trust in us is thousands of kilometers away. I am very happy to meet you. If I have a chance, I will come to Qinhuangdao next time.

Now the restaurant staff is calling me
A programming novice who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you have no idea in this regard, it is best to self-study. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it also requires 6 months to study.
But if you plan to get into this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, we need to look at the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, this training institution will be meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong teaching staff.
Secondly, before choosing, inquire about this training institution. It is best to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like and whether the courses taught are good or bad.
Hello, actually I don’t know how to answer your question, because you didn’t give a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with one’s own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, these will all be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or have graduated with a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective. Many offline and online training institutions are actually very good. , but firstly, the cost of learning is high, and secondly, it requires a lot of time investment. It basically requires intensive training for 3-6 months.
But if it is the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Many learning resources on the Internet are free now, or there are many training resources on station b. If you don’t know how to find resources, you can also contact us through the profile. Come to me for free resources or detailed consultation.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can afford a certain amount of money and time for learning, then it is recommended to study at a training institution. This way you don’t have to study very hard. The teacher explains in detail, and there are people who answer questions. In addition, you can plan your studies. Or supervision can also be helpful.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements with quotas for internal referrals. After studying, they recommend companies to go to, which can save a lot of trouble in the interview process of finding a job later.
The above are some of my opinions. As I mentioned above, I don’t know your situation, so I can only give a general introduction and not a detailed introduction. If you have other questions you want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said I would arrive before 1 o&#39;clock, and I saw it on the App

When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and I was happy if I had it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and I was happy when I reached it; when I matured, I discovered that happiness was actually a state of mind, and I was happy when I understood it.
Be the truest and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; there is only one path in life, follow your own path; there are two treasures in life: good health, a good mood, and living a beautiful life till old age!
At every stage of life, you will encounter different problems.
Many times, what binds you is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since you can&#39;t avoid it, it&#39;s better to face it calmly.

Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) Saudi Arabia’s first contemporary art biennale, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, was held on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. Officially open to the public, a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
This biennale is jointly planned by the Diriyah Biennale Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China. Philip Tinari, Director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, serves as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is &quot;Crossing the River by Feeling for Stones&quot;, which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: &quot;Crossing the River by Feeling for Stones&quot; &quot;Inheritance as Experiment&quot; &quot;Thinking on the Edge&quot; &quot;Going to the Public&quot; &quot;Beauty&quot; New World&quot; and &quot;On the Spirit of Art&quot;.
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including paintings, installation art, performing arts and other forms; the works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted much attention, and some artists use novel The method uses recycled materials to create creations. For example, in &quot;The Story Behind the Series: Endless Pictures of Streams and Mountains&quot; (2014), Xu Bing used waste to reconstruct a classic landscape painting.
Buckley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this biennale can establish an international dialogue and provide global audiences with the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia’s booming cultural industry and creative community and strengthen interactions.
Philip Tinari said: &quot;The goal of the Biennale is dual, not only to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, but also to integrate Saudi audiences into the contemporary art world. &quot;
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to provide employment assistance for those who have been lifted out of poverty, and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently issued policies related to the management of rural public welfare positions to promote rural revitalization to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
The relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security said that at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare positions to place people who have been lifted out of poverty and other rural needy groups into employment. Play an important role in various public service capabilities and other aspects.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance. They mainly unify the scope of targets, fund management, job development, job management and other aspects of recruiting rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations clearly follow the principles of &quot;setting up positions according to needs, appointing people according to positions, dynamic management, and total quantity control&quot;, &quot;who develops, who uses, and who is responsible&quot; and &quot;one person, one position, voluntary disclosure, and unified management&quot; ” principle is set.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and job placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that each rural public welfare post development department should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the personnel placed in rural public welfare posts. ; Require relevant departments to regularly supervise the payment of rural public welfare job subsidies.

Hello
Can the order be canceled?
I place an order again
Has it been cancelled?
2. Although the rightists have had successful times in history, they have not lasted long. The reason why they are short is because they are bright when they are given a little sunshine, and they sweat when they drink some boiled water.
But to be honest, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not completely agree with some of what Li Weidong said, I care about what he said and respect Li Weidong because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about China&#39;s social issues. Take it seriously.
But I am opposed to his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary. Revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people&#39;s livelihood, a mixed political group, and then foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
4. To change or improve China&#39;s attitude, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who seek to draw chestnuts from the fire through political speculation are not rightists, but bastards.
Let’s talk about Zuo again.
The left is actually a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right speeches and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is the dregs that the Communist Party has thrown away!
5. Recently, I have seen some friends getting really angry while criticizing the rebels and refuting Zuodi. I think this is not necessary.
Don&#39;t try to reason with traitors or leftists, they are all the same and unreasonable.
Don&#39;t try to prove that we are right, let alone get the rebels and leftists to admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: When the rebels call you five cents, and when the leftists call you the right dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people had ideals when they were young, but when they grow old, they forget their ideals, or pursue their ideals, only to become paranoid.
He and his ideals drifted further and further, and even the boy who slayed the dragon eventually turned into an evil dragon.
I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. Due to the innate genes of China&#39;s history and culture, China as a whole should be left-leaning.
The domestic right is liberal and focuses on efficiency and development, while the left strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
Nowadays, society in general hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are undoubtedly fighting to the left. It is estimated that this will continue for many years.
Even though I don’t understand it, just give it a like and it’ll be over
Don&#39;t say anything anymore, Huahua is so loyal
In the past two years, the US imperialism&#39;s blockade and containment of Huawei&#39;s chips has not only put Huawei into unprecedented difficulties, but also caused &quot;American&quot; companies to suffer huge losses.
The US emperor suppresses China&#39;s chip industry and requires its own companies and related companies in allied countries to block our country&#39;s chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in reduced R&amp;D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers. , thus causing shortages and chaos in the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, &quot;core shortage&quot; has affected major industries around the world. For example, car companies have suspended production and mobile phone prices have increased. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered greatly.
In order to control the autonomy of &quot;chips&quot;, technology giants in more and more countries have begun to &quot;de-beautify&quot; their products.
In order to firmly control global semiconductors and contain the development of China&#39;s semiconductor industry, the United States has been making frequent moves recently, hosting the &quot;Chip Summit&quot;; inviting giants from 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and allocating funds to support local American technology giants. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, the old American technology giant Intel spent US$20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
Most people believe that Intel&#39;s move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to take away TSMC&#39;s &quot;job.&quot;
The reason why this is so certain is because Intel, as a veteran American technology giant, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large talent team and technical reserves. It will surely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou dismissed Intel’s decision.
At the &quot;2021 Master Think Tank Forum&quot; held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement. Regarding Intel&#39;s move to invest in building a wafer fab, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly: Intel&#39;s building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel&#39;s entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou is still bitter about the grudge between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel had always been the jewel in the US manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world and the world&#39;s dominant semiconductor company.
By the 1980s, the world&#39;s high-end semiconductor chips had been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. Chip design, manufacturing, packaging and testing were all completed by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have been deterred by the huge cost of building production lines.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to see the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, he could set up a company specializing in chip design. in wafer manufacturing factories.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou’s vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC focuses its main business on the single link of &quot;wafer processing&quot;. It does not conduct design and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which had just been founded at that time, was a minion in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once approached Intel for investment. However, when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing process of the chip industry, it was clear that it had a high opinion of itself and looked down on TSMC, so it decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then would now start to engage in foundry manufacturing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou finds it ironic for Intel to enter wafer foundry.
Today, TSMC’s market value has surpassed Intel’s.
Faced with TSMC&#39;s strong offensive, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
No more waiting
It’s been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06😅
Let’s take a look at some [weird hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: the rise of dragons in February, the price increase of Orion, and the Lalamove incident. Public opinion spreads to form a peak, and then [exponential decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipates. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again. .
They look exactly the same as the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] once displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches in the same event, showing [lone peak shape], [jagged shape], and [cliff shape].
[In the shape of an isolated peak], it is artificially heated and quickly hits the hot search list, attracting public attention; [In the shape of a zigzag], it is heated periodically to ensure that the topic remains on the hot search list; [In the shape of a cliff], it means a collective withdrawal, and the hot search has finished its use. Function&quot;, receive new tasks and rush to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the peak of the popularity of one event happens to be the trough of another event. The time is exactly right. The same group of navy must have received the mission and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which are responsible for popularizing science, which ones cause war and build momentum, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones incite emotions, which ones that coerce decision-making , Black product accounts are refined in batches and nodes, and almost all factors in the spread of public opinion are taken into consideration.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors such as stance and emotion, and relying only on objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Every step we take will leave traces, and we will dig out these traces together.

Damei 360 integrated home decoration
Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No. 156 Huancheng South Road
It was introduced by a friend at first because of trust, so I chose to take a look. Initially, my budget was 70,000 for basic decoration.
As soon as he arrived at the store, he started a series of deceptions.
It was the first time I went to the store and I just showed them my floor plan. They didn&#39;t go to the actual house to measure, but they were able to give me a quote and said that my 135 house can be purchased for 70,000. They gave me a rough estimate. After looking at their materials, I don’t know what brand of materials they are.
Their second trick is that as soon as you arrive at the store, they will drag you to pay a deposit (and once you pay this money, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay a deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pitfall. I am a living example of being deceived. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan.
There were many problems with the quote he gave me. The 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovations, or any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three were the bulk of the cost of basic renovations.
Apart from these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company. They asked me to sign the contract without explaining anything clearly at the beginning.
When I went to them to refund my money, they acted like they were very experienced and had a small dedicated team to deal with you.
No matter what, it&#39;s the customer&#39;s problem and they are not responsible for it.
There are all kinds of shirking of responsibilities, and there are many details. I don’t want to shed tears after saying them all. In short, don’t choose them, because the house my friend renovated with them is also of poor quality, and they will calculate various expenses for you later.
What a scam. They used to be a deceptive faucet decoration, but now they changed it to Damei. It seems they went out of business and changed it to something else.
So don’t choose such a cheating decoration company.
In the future, when choosing, please check these on Baidu and check these consultations because decoration is not a small expense.
If you want to ask questions to the merchant, please log in or register first
It is strictly prohibited to publish any form of merchant reviews. For details, please see the merchant inclusion statement.
Dianping’s Kunming decoration design channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, business hours and other information of Damei 360 integrated home decoration. If you are looking for a decoration company, go to Dianping.
It’s so scary, please cancel your order if it doesn’t arrive within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change your address?
Okay, then don&#39;t cancel this conversation. If I don&#39;t refund my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if I can cancel before 15 minutes.
The saliva chicken should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, so I couldn&#39;t eat it.
Appointment in the Starry Sky丨The Geminid Meteor Shower will reach its climax on the 14th-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian) According to astronomical science experts, as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will have its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers Observations can be carried out in the latter part of the night.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast An Jiu captured the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent objects of most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent object of the Geminid meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not &quot;bred&quot; by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in popularizing astronomy, said that just like New Year blockbusters, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the &quot;release period&quot; can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is famous for its large flow and stability. Together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A distinctive feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroids are relatively slow, colorful, and there are many bolides. It is suitable for both visual viewing and photography by beginners of astrophotography.
The Geminid meteor shower photographed by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year&#39;s Geminid meteor shower will reach its maximum at around 15:00 on December 14, with the maximum hour ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant point is directly overhead under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
&quot;Last year, the &#39;colorful&#39; Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year&#39;s Geminid meteor shower will be interfered by the moonlight, so the excitement will be reduced a bit.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar. The moon phase is a waxing gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will rise higher at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after the moon has set in the second half of the night, but they should pay attention to keeping warm and cold. &quot;
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
&quot;It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a broad view facing the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently for the moon to set before making visual observations.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flux in all directions, so you do not have to keep looking at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
If those who like photography want to shoot gorgeous &quot;meteor shower blockbusters&quot;, it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and sustainability reasons, a tripod, spare batteries and a shutter release cable are also essential. &quot;
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
From my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to LCD TV. The differences in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly include the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses more on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market. In other words, laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs ranges from 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally over 75 inches, with the largest over 100 inches, fully meeting users&#39; needs for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales proportion of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMM&#39;s forecast, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has achieved such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in terms of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeballs. Compared with the backlight emission of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions and causes less stimulation to the eyes.
The Saixi Laboratory of China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute and ophthalmologists from Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through rigorous comparative tests of laser TVs and LCD TVs watched by people under the same conditions.
The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye protection properties and even has certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, most laser TVs currently on the market are priced at more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser TVs have many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TVs and projections.
With ultra-short focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance. It does not require much space, and the host is compact and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It’s not about false demand, but the product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not for audio and video players. If you want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has pros and cons. After weighing Just make your own judgment, don&#39;t be afraid of taking one side&#39;s word for it.
Simply put, in order to get close to the screen, the ultra-wide-angle and close-focus projector - laser TV, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, microstructured Fresnel screens are used, which is expensive. The price of an 80-inch LCD can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I particularly hate the fact that projection manufacturers use diffuse reflection as a selling point that is good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light to the eyes. If it is diffusely reflected to the ceiling, the eyes cannot see it. Yes, if you have to be serious about it, the LCD TV is also diffusely &quot;directly illuminated&quot;. If you turn on the TV, wouldn&#39;t the ceiling be illuminated as well?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, there will be no image at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of high-gain screens has been ignored. A large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio’s Selected Quality Store does not have any branches yet.
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the lady sent me the optional time schedule, and the reply to the message was relatively timely~
Before I went there, I looked at the photography works in the store. Most of them were outdoor wedding dresses. The photos were very beautiful and involved a lot of shooting styles.
When the day arrived, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with the young lady. She very patiently helped me try on two sets of clothes that I was struggling with. Finally, I decided to start makeup and styling. The photographer would set up some props before shooting, guide the movements, and pay attention to every detail. It’s also more focused on excellence.
But maybe because I didn’t share specific shooting ideas with me, the style I wanted was not what I wanted, but it should look good🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help select the photos and communicate the post-production style. I feel very attentive.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, just wait and see for the effect~
This is the second time I won the photo-based Overlord Meal event. I was able to choose one piece of most of the clothes in the audience for the photo shoot.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting. The photographer in charge of the shooting is a younger brother who was born in 1995. I feel a little green. I hope I can give more suggestions in the future on how to guide customers&#39; shooting actions~ Very talkative. Yes, the shooting process was quite enjoyable.
Reply from Wen Photography Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio’s Selected Quality Store
It’s on the homepage, let’s take a look at Queenie too~
When you arrive at the store, you first fill in your name and phone number and then choose the clothes. You can choose any wedding dress. I was quite patient when changing three or four sets of clothes. After choosing, I put on makeup for a long time. The service attitude is also good. I will teach you how to pose for the photo later. The face looked so big when it came out. It was said that it would take half a month to complete, but it was sent in three or four days. It seems to be no different from the original film.
[Environment] Overall it’s pretty good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup locations, and inside is a photo studio.
[Service] Very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements carefully.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to take retakes.
[Experience] Maybe the styling is a bit too much. The original double eyelids were replaced with three eyelids.
The ends of my eyebrows were also shaved, which was a bit embarrassing for someone who doesn’t draw eyebrows on a daily basis.
The photos were sent to me ten days ago, but I am not very satisfied with the effect of the P picture. I feel that the double eyelids are still very obvious.
Because I wasn’t sure what style I wanted, I tried on two outfits, but after a lot of picking and choosing, I chose a black dress. The girl said this outfit was more Hepburn’s retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my makeup and hair. The hairstylist and makeup artist were very patient in helping me get it done, and I was very satisfied with the results.
After I finished my makeup and hair, I started taking pictures. The photographer guided me throughout the whole process of posing, which was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the filming was completed, I carefully selected four of my favorite photos. The editor said that the film would be completed within 15 minutes and the ending was very satisfying ~
No reply for 3 days...I can&#39;t join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system doesn&#39;t recognize my credit card!
The weirdest thing is, I use the same credit card every time I pay
Now I have to pay shipping every time
Can I be exempted first and then charge my monthly fee after you complete the investigation? Is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the &quot;Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)&quot;, to become an insurance brokerage company, you must meet three key words: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the past three years, and the minimum limit It can only be established with a capital of RMB 50 million and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three items are actually very demanding. To sum up, they must be strong, must be approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks nationwide), and shareholders must have a good style. As an insurance brokerage company, umbrella insurance , policyholders do not need to question too much whether umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which not all insurance companies can meet.
At this point, it&#39;s pretty good and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies’ celebrity critical illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mario No. 5 critical illness insurance. Both the claim adjuster and the underwriter are Hetai Life and Umbrella Insurance are just third-party intermediaries, so there is no need to question their reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesperson wages, are generally more cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible and supports monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of policyholders. , and at the same time, the lever of insurance can be maximized.
This is still very good.
Can consider it.
From the perspective of salesperson professionalism: This is particularly important because insurance is an industry that requires very strong professionalism. Many Internet product customers can insure themselves. This will lead to many misunderstandings. In the area of health notification and occupation, Non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance and feel that they are healthy or qualified. This easily leads to many hidden dangers in claims and the risk of being denied claims.
I myself have done insurance phone sales in &quot;Tencent WeInsurance&quot; (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I tell you this very responsibly.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but people are unreliable. Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are also a lot of misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan of insurance covers 6 million, buy the insurance to get a mobile phone, and get 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and ignore the trivial. They will not tell the policy holder that for 1 yuan in the first month, they need to pay as normal in the second month. The fee ranges from a few dozen to 200. Many customers deduct the fee for one or two years and don’t know what they are buying.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan and the insurance company would pay 6 million (a pie in the world).
The free mobile phone is only given to special policy number ranges such as 6666 and 8888, and if a winning text message is sent, you will not redeem it and no one will remind you.
(This is another pitfall for policyholders) The free critical illness insurance amount of 60,000 yuan is short-term. If you only rely on this and no other commercial insurance, if a serious illness does occur, what can 60,000 yuan be used to solve it? If there is no problem, life will start to run naked in the future.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So overall, there is no problem with the platform, nor with the products. What is problematic is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salespeople.
It is recommended that the questioner consider it comprehensively and carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products are also more cost-effective than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers by underwriting offline products, and each person saved 2,000-3,000 yuan per year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Broker, I have 3 years of experience in corporate management training, have served nearly a thousand corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before applying for insurance, I will start from the customer&#39;s needs and tailor insurance products for the customer. When applying for insurance, we will shop around for customers and try our best to obtain the best underwriting results for customers. After applying for insurance, we will organize and manage policies for customers, so that customers can feel at ease.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which policyholders can complete all insurance application processes independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policy holder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign. All steps can be completed by the policy holder independently.
Although there is not much of a &quot;ceremonial feel&quot; when applying for Internet insurance, and there may not even be a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract at all.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of &quot;telephone sales&quot;, but there is also a fatal problem in purchasing insurance in this way, that is-the subsequent service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, we should seriously consider whether the &quot;intermediary&quot; we choose can be with us for a long time and many years from now. What about “insurance intermediaries” who will also provide services to us?
So how can I contact the food delivery specialist?
It&#39;s almost 3 o&#39;clock
Does that mean you have to give me compensation?
I said I would knock on the door and deliver the goods
But the rider was left at the door, and then he left
Wrong delivery
Your rider has already picked up my takeout at #NUMBER#, but is still telling me that it is waiting.
The rider received my takeaway at 19:25, but still refused to set off
I&#39;m going to finish shopping. Do you want other takeaways?

Still have to wait?
I want to deliver an order

thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
Regardless of political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the moment you started to send Facebook friend requests, then made ridiculing posts, and then you tried to post the so-called my home address and father&#39;s name on social media, I have adopted a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me six times a day, but also continued to brazenly discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, including my appearance, figure, fertility, and what not. Leave messages such as planting strawberries on the bed and whether you want to insert them, etc., I... forget it.
Unexpectedly, I later received messages from many friends about your Facebook friend’s account uploading a photo of you and comments containing sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news about me calling the police was uploaded, you did not restrain yourself at all, but instead became more arrogant.
I don’t care what your political background is or what your status is. In our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue to make such ridiculing, cryptic, humiliating, and abusive remarks. You can also continue to say that you just care and pay attention to me. You can continue to think that this is not harassment. You can even continue to deny that it was not made by you. pictures or continue to make any offensive remarks.
That&#39;s right, I can&#39;t and don&#39;t have the ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor do I want to know you, and I don’t need your judgment about my appearance and figure.
I don&#39;t even think any girl would be willing to let someone humiliate her like that in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, are you okay?
Even if I say yes, you won’t believe it.
I don’t think any girl can say she is okay after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who don&#39;t even have basic moral character will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice lies in the heart of the people.
I cut off some of the messages for everyone to comment on.
If you post it yourself, no one can pretend to be you, right?
All I can say is that you are an enemy of civilization.
A knowing smile

Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional pro-CCP media Duowei reported: Latest news on Sino-U.S. relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also disclosed, A rare visit to Guam by one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy&#39;s arsenal sends an important signal to U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank &quot;South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform&quot;, on January 9, satellites discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; will go to the South China Sea for deployment.
This is the first time the USS Carl Vinson has deployed F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;, the US military aircraft carriers currently cruising in the Pacific include the &quot;USS Abraham Lincoln&quot; which departed from the United States on January 3.
The &quot;Lincoln&quot; also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which is affiliated with the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; and the guided missile destroyer &quot;Stockdale&quot;.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the &quot;South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform&quot; released the latest satellite images, showing that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @南海strategicsituational awareness) Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight path of the U.S. carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo@South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
Three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam. Analysts said this sent a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gathered the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China&#39;s Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine &quot;Nevada&quot; to Guam has strengthened cooperation between the United States and allies in the region, demonstrated U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and Ongoing commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called &quot;Boomer submarines&quot;.
The whereabouts of the 14 &quot;Thunder Submarines&quot; in the U.S. Navy&#39;s fleet are usually closely guarded secrets.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder submarine &quot;the most important survivable weapon in the nuclear triad,&quot; which also includes ballistic missiles with silos located in the United States and nuclear-capable warheads such as the B-2 and B-52. bomber.
I was chatting with a friend about Meta’s recent 26% plunge, with its market value evaporating by US$251 billion. Zuckerberg responded that he was “facing unprecedented competition.” What was the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what the function positioning, are Meta’s traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest &quot;advertising alliance&quot;. Many apps have external ads from Meta and can be monetized through Meta&#39;s advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple’s privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple&#39;s current privacy policy is very user-friendly and will clearly prompt users whether to allow apps to obtain their information. The normal reaction of most people is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs it again, the impact on Meta&#39;s revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta&#39;s previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is not sure how high it is, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta&#39;s revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies engaged in maritime business.
Meta&#39;s office in Hong Kong has about a few hundred people, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
If Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, and most of the money they spend goes to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte&#39;s TT is now one of Meta&#39;s main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
Various domestic agencies are helping Byte to advertise with Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven&#39;t looked into it recently, but it&#39;s definitely not better than before.
The stage of large-scale cash burning by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem isn&#39;t just declining revenue, it&#39;s a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly, looks at future expectations.
Clearly, Meta&#39;s expectations were not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the &quot;Metaverse&quot;.
The Metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the Metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta&#39;s market value in the past two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Although Facebook is very prosperous now, with annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars, Facebook actually has a very strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it does not have a good security moat.
Although several of his social apps now have relatively high daily activity and are also mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of tiktok, and it can be subverted in the blink of an eye.
As for the elusive concept of the metaverse, there is no hope of success in the short term. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept searching. The fundamental reason is the new track, but I think his track choice is wrong and is a road of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
