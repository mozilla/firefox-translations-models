Is there a way to punish him.
So not to do this happen again.

Zhejiang University academic annual conference students singing protagonist research results make people's brain hole open - Xinhua
Washing hands with air, Haqi to judge the disease, accurately search for the source of smog last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-hole academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, covering the environment, machinery, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities education and other major fields, students from a curious idea, to create a number of application value of high-end inventions, some of which have been awarded in the domestic and international.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Doctor
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smartphone end on the spot, only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to breathe a breath, this instrument can be able to initially detect the physical health from the gas components you exhalt."
Zhang Diming said that the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
The intelligent bracelet on the market can detect health conditions, and generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
The biosensor uses graphene, a new material, and its target is chemical elements, and a keen "smell" makes it more deeply and accurately reflect the health of the body.
Smart Surgical Lights: Doctor's High Eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won the Silver Award at this year ’ s 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, a master's student in the School of Optoelectronics Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps, and invented the intelligent LED surgery without shadow lights.
"A lot of early detection and removal of diseases are not in place, and it is related to the lamp used in the operating room of the doctor."
Shen Junfei said, for example, when a cancer is tested early, if the doctor can't see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical lamp has four light plates that enhance the difference between different tissues in light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectral, color uniformity and shadowy rate according to the needs and personal habits of the operation at any time.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Shao Yif Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize for the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: Save water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most, wipe soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, and Li Qi Zhang and other students have invented a set of "air hand-washing devices."
As long as the handwashing table on the stand, our weight can compress the air.
"It's like a gas cylinder.
Compressing the air, forming fluid at the tap, combines water.
That way, we can wash the hands.
Color rendering reactions and bacterial residual experiments have proved that the effect of hand washing by hand washing this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, both to ensure the degree of washing, but also save 90% of the water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Summit of Great Challenges, the invention stood out among the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.
Please arrange a replacement to me as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel your order and return cash, do not have the points, and will not use #PRS_ORG#!
There are bones and spicy kimchi not suitable for children to eat
If so, please order as soon as possible
Not for the moment, thank you.
He told me to tell you about where you are.
I don't wait, cancel the order
I #PRS_ORG# bought it, but I wrote the wrong address
Can it be changed?
or cancel the order
Okay, it's troublesome
It makes sense for a certificate of the first aid?
This is one of my skills in addition to a driver's license that feels important!
Popularize: First aid measures are actually emergency rescues in the event of an emergency, that is, before the ambulance comes to the rescue.
As we all know, there is still some time in the process of ambulances after the accident, and that is precisely this time is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a brain haemorrhage, a respiratory arrest, then the window of our life was only four minutes, four minutes in prime!
So people around me know how important first aid is!
When there are people around us to fall, we can save him through professional knowledge, instead of stupidly standing there there without doing anything, this feeling of helplessness is too scary.
“In China, our official data is that three million people die every year, the most dangerous thing is called cardiac arrest.
An average of 15% in the United States can be saved.
At the Las Vegas casino hotel, seventy-eight percent can be saved, and Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%. ”
That's what the first reaction founder Lu Le said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, you pinch people without any effect.
It is necessary to do artificial breathing and chest compressions to save people.
I've found that very few of us now have this awareness of learning first aid, but it's too late to happen, so I'm still calling on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time in the face of emergencies.
Maybe it could save a person's life!
First aid can be signed up at your local Red Cross training center, I am in Zhuhai Red Cross training center, students and preferential benefits.
PS: The last figure is to record the goals you have to complete before the age of 25, and it is a few months ago to add the first aid certificate to the target list, but it is indeed completed!
Then go to the other want to test the certificate, intend to go to a diving certificate, before the little red book to see there is a diving first aid certificate, this test seems to have a first aid certificate to go to the exam, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I made it ##NUMBER#.
Thirteen of these shrimp dumplings are one!
Not tried
How to #NAME# not to write?
One to be thirteen dollars?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed the food, this time a shrimp dumpling to eat for me!
Because I saw that I had finished effectively when I entered the code.
Let me start by saying that I personally think that the Four Seas is a full-scale rotten film, which is in various senses.
But you'll say that this film isn't a bright spot, and that's not at least a good score.
There are many kinds of rotten fragments, so that you can fall asleep in the movie theater one, let you read after the outrage also counts as one, "Four Seas" for the audience is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing in this film is that it seems to be a creature in the Kling novel, indescribable, and the loopholes are like the windcraper's windwear on the masony.
Even after watching it, you'll wonder if there's a director's metaphor in it, but when you think about it, you'll find out that it's actually a shit.
Let ’ s start with a few details that I ’ m hard to understand.
The man's place of residence should be on a small island in the south, and his grandmother was dependent on it.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then arranged for a grandfather in the neighborhood to drive a small van to send her to the northeast to see the snow.
The elderly sit in the van from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father were very relieved about it.
Then the old man was no below.
Driving in a hotel on an abandoned steamer, how did the woman get his business license?
Why can the island's flying party small mix be easy to seal a mountain road?
Then the truck that sent steel in the middle of the road was parked on the side of the road, and the truck driver could not find it around the area.
The idea is also too obvious.
Why did a small mixed car party that did not have a credit and suspected of illegality become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury why not call the police, the police in the film also asked whether there is a difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open the door in a room card in a hotel, and then forcefully arrange to find the hotel owner and sit alone outside the room and sleep?
This inexplicable plot is full of the entire film, and it pains me because the plot is so outrageous that I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the main theme of the film, or that the film does not have a theme at all, it is a stitching of the face.
At the beginning of the film you will think that he wants to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess that it may be a motivational film, half of the time you think it may be a drama that reflects the survival of the small town youth is not easy, after watching you do not know what you have watched, followed by a deep doubt about yourself, why did you go to the cinema to enjoy the shit.
For most people, they are also very familiar with the routines of all kinds of movies, such as if you want to make a motorcyclist, then you want to make a motorcycle, then you can tell the audience how to be a gifted rookie to success step by step.
If you want to make a love film, then you honestly talk about the entanglement between the young people and the waiter and the waiter's sister who like to ride the motorcycle.
If you want to reflect the reality, that at least your plot cannot appear something that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zheng was just burned, and then the character can sing), you can't go to some brain holes that Kennedy can't see.)
As for the woman who is clearly not mentally retarded in some ways as a 5-year-old child, I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
There's another point I don't quite understand, why is Han Han as a racing driver so keen to add a crash plot in his own films?
Is this kind of film arranged in the Spring Festival, is it to add to the audience?

South African doctor: Omicron's transmission is strong but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
As the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, more than five thousand doctors in the province of Gauteng, South Africa, report that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are mild, such as physical pain and cough-like symptoms such as the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he looked at dozens of patients every day, but no patient has yet to be hospitalized.
“They ’ re able to control the disease at home, and most people recover in isolation within 10 to 14 days, ” Pillay said.
This includes older patients and those with health problems, he said, who would have been more likely to be in severe condition due to coronavirus infections.
In the previous wave of Delta outbreaks, he said, he treated the new coronavirus patient "difficult breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people are hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it's still going to be weeks to gather enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of the new coronavirus patients hospitalized in recent weeks are severe, half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave; the average hospitalization period has been shortened from eight days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent coronavirus patients, while the proportion of deaths in the early outbreak in South Africa has reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute for Health, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: “At the moment, almost every indication is that this is a milder disease. ”
He added: "It's still early, we need to get late-stage data.
Usually, hospitalizations and deaths occur late, and we only have two weeks to enter this wave of outbreaks. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are looking at the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading coronavirus strain, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, of which South Africa is at the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases detected in Gauteng province in the first week of December increased by 40 percent, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, the 80 boxes were all sent out!

Education Review: What is it about saving abducted children?
If the analogy is a well-known public service slogan that "no trade and sale is not killed", then, in a good environment where there is no "trafficking" demand, the group prevention and control, the whole people against the abduction is unprofitable, the risk is high, the cost is high, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security issued an emergency release platform on the emergency release platform of the child's missing information developed by the Ministry of Public Security.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing information for children and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
I heard that the App is called "reunion", which is full of warmth.
The new technology means not only name "literature", full of feelings, but also the use of information, practical and effective.
The primary goal of afugmenting law enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishments to social prevention to legal education, can enumerate a lot of "big words".
However, before the trafficking case is broken, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim.
Under the urgent purpose of "research for help", such as "abduction of children should be the death penalty" and other popular and controversial topics, can be put aside for a temporary, cautious discussion; but to save the abducted children.
Based on the experience of investigation of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to staying away from the place of the crime as soon as possible after the success.
The abduction operation is delayed by one minute, and the child may be further away from the parent step, and the difficulty of detection of the case will increase one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to take out an effective way to directly help solve the case and find the child, such as the "reunion" platform.
After all, "trafficking" is a big task that needs to be done by the entire legal system.
Combating crime, protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to judicial protection, as well as the meticulousness of law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "morning the child and the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can also do better.
For example, a common case, a family of three at the train station resting, parents sleep well, and wake up to find that the child is missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, it should at least have a fairly sense of protection.
Both parents take turns to rest, or put their children under safe protection, are the minimum means to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police to combat trafficking crimes, the purchase of abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
Individual wrongdoing, often just a link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the statutory criminality for the crime of child trafficking is five years; the circumstances are particularly serious, and the death penalty can be obtained and property confiscated.
Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child trafficking is obviously a more serious punishment.
There are still a lot of trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in raising their children's concepts, and the legal consciousness is weak.
The legal education of this part of the people should be followed up in parallel.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it is not up to the official strict law enforcement alone.
If the "market" is widespread, the traffickers will be eager to gain their minds, and the means of trafficking are constantly innovated, forming a "fighting method" situation with law enforcement, and the trafficking action is bound to fall into the imprecion of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness and popularizing legal common sense, it also helps to eliminate the crime of trafficking and buying children.

Democracy summit ends, Biden says fire of freedom never goes out
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by U.S. President Joe Biden, attended by governments in 110 countries around the world and attended by leaders of civil society and the private sector, ended Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never put it out.
He also said that the second global "democracy summit" is planned to be held next year.
Taiwan government representative and councillor Tang Feng and Luo Guancong, a pro-democracy activist currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said: “We know how tough the work we ’ re in front of us.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because I've said it before, as this summit has shown, that the democratic world is everywhere.
The autocrats can never extinguish the micro-fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people around the world and around the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of society as a whole.
“As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent accountability, to be more resistant to the forces of despotism and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest, ” he said.
The themes of the "Democracy Summit" on the second day were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the same day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
“It ’ s time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. ”
Hong Kong pro-democracy human rights activist Luo Guancong spoke to the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue their attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong and Uighurs and Tibetans.
“For too long, the world has been accepting the rise of China without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable, ” he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have to ensure that the renaissance of democracy is our top priority. ”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the CCP's threat.
"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat [the CCP] threaten our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
Tang Feng, a member of the Taiwan Executive Council, issued a "State Statement" via video in a video highlighting Taiwan's standing at the forefront of confrontation against autocracy and authoritarianism in a roundtable discussion on "The Fight Against Digital Dictatorship and Affirmative Rights."
He also shared his experience in fighting the coronavirus epidemic through transparency and building mutual trust.
"At a time of the rise of democracy in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of global confrontation with authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere, in the name of public health and collective interests, rationalizing human rights abuses, showed signs of a backsliding on global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to seal the city to control the epidemic, we can defeat the fake information without taking the shelves. "
At the same time that the agenda of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" was held, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries that have been found to be seriously violated human rights violations, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that is found to be using surveillance technology to assist human rights violations.

They are so strong that the ball hits the clapping, the vibrations are very large, the hardball can't stand, the master is difficult to navigate.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that it is â €“the ’ s tennis is so hard, know that you won ’ t learn, and you don ’ t have to buy it, you ’ re willing to buy, you ’ re going to make a bargain, you ’ re playing twice, you don ’ t have a pain.
When you can really distinguish between good or bad, it means that you have improved, and when I am here to buy expensive ones, I will make two dollars.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a better second-hand racket, choose prince, or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good racket can not sell the price, new 500, 600 is very good, second-hand 200 pieces, have thousands of yuan shot to enjoy the unscented?
It is very friendly to the novice, but after the novice stage, it is chicken, but most people, especially girls, can not get to the novice stage.

In fact, it pays a lot to the clothes of fat girls.
The body of the fat girl can not wear too short or too long, the length is almost on the knee, just able to cover the thigh fat place.
The skirt is too short to reveal the obesity on the legs.
Overlonging will give people a short and fat feeling.

When the girl is a target for her sister to raise money: "It is good to think of the skin and meat injury" - Xinhua
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large plank, and the wooden board had the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow".
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl Gandan' arrow target for sister fundraised" brushed the circle of friends.
Photos show that a girl in Wulin Square in Hangzhou stood in front of a large plan board that was slightly taller than a man, and the wooden board was written with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one stone", which could use bow and arrow shooting after payment to passers-by.
The act sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of the publicity department of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl was a fundraiser for her sister to make such a radical move, but this behavior is not worth advocating, after a warning, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girls' Street 'Arrow Target' Fundraised to Be Adoned
In the online picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large plank, and the wooden board has the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one stone" in black ink, and the other wooden board in front of her is written with its bank account and WeChat, Alipay account number and so on.
The picture sparked controversy after going on the internet.
Some netizens believe that this move is a "begging behavior of the eyeballs", and there are many netizens who sympathize with this.
"We were around 10am on the 23rd when we patroled the square around 10am to find the situation, there were a lot of onlookers at that time."
In an interview with the local media, the police station near the incident said that the total two girls at the stall, all of them were about 20 years old, and dressed up beautifully.
Among them, the girl who is a "human flesh target" has been crying, asking passers to play this game; the other girl on the side to help shout, said that her friend's sister got leukaemia, now in urgent need of surgery, please help everyone.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister's leukaemia treatment."
Last night, the person in charge of the publicity department of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl was named Ji Jiali and raised money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still takes more than three hundred thousand dollars, I can't think of a good way to fund up and make such behavior.
He said that in the whole process, two girls one as a target, one is responsible for laying the hand, but not involved in it, the whole process did not find an arrow, just someone onlooked around and took photos to micro-blog.
After the police was identified by the security department, the use of bows and arrows is not subject to the scope of control.
The person in charge said, “It is not recommended to adopt this kind of eyeball fund-raising. ”
After being warned by the police of the police station, she had left the police station.

What's the most fire in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only an Olympic athlete can win the prize?
Some time ago there was a "fast look! Project Manager can impact the gold medal of the Olympic project" article is very hot, it is mentioned that the project manager in many projects, it is absolutely possible to be a horse, no one can be a horse, no one can do it:  bricks, travel, stay up late is the project manager's daily routine, fire, back pot, apology is not under the words.
A seemingly joked article, but also said the project manager's daily poignancy, behind the representative is the current project management work is not the focus on the current project management work.
People who are engaged in project management have gradually chosen to get themselves out of the hardships of their work through some actions.
Judging from the number of PMPs (internationally certified project management professionals) who are climbing each year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management capabilities.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants in the country is nearly 60 million, the number of people certified by PMP® is about 420,000, and the number of valid holders is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates in the world.
In the past decade, the number of PMP holders has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers are aware that it is not advisable to do things by simply copying the "old experience" of the past, and the rapidly changing working environment allows us to learn to explore the road on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, can the PMP test ensure that the project management work is unimpeded?
Many project management beginners say that by learning relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, you can systematically master the top ten areas of project management and other relevant knowledge points such as the five major process groups, but it is still foggy when it is actually done in project management.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, there is no project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, work can not be landed, project estimation is not accurate, the control sensitivity is poor, the project is delayed again; the division of labor is not clear, the team "old oil strip" does not know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance.
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R & D management for more than ten years, has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of key R & D talents such as product managers, project managers, etc., and won the honorary title of "Chinese Enterprises R & D Management Talent Training Base" Zhong Tianhua Consulting came with the online course of "Research and Development Project Manager Special Training Camp".
"R & D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course This is an online fragmented learning approach, combining the actual combat cases, tools and methods of R & D companies to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the road of their own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote project manager training processes and bring efficient operational results to enterprises.
It is impossible to say that it is necessary to see how other students evaluate the course: this course is not only by the Zhong Tianhuaxia expert team (formerly Huawei R & D management team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprises real business scenarios, the course content is in-depth and shallow professional explanation.
It will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, a rich template form, to help students use the content of learning after class to apply the content of the study to specific work.

A wide variety of full red envelopes, eye-catching live broadcasts once again let consumers cry to the benefits, this consumption boom on the one hand makes people lament the growing strength of national consumption, on the other hand, also have to calm down to think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jixin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jixin") issued a rational consumption advocate, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, which is an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
In general, China's residents perform better at the level of financial consumption, but they reflect large differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and we need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the key to the continuous attention of financial education; the "China Youth Debt Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance shows that the younger generation has a huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way for consumption upgrading, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of the people have no debt accumulation, although the younger generation as a whole presents a "excessive proflution" label, although the "over-splurge" label is very different, but some young people do have excessive consumption and consumption behavior.Even leading to the gradual increase in social problems, financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibility and guide them forward.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jixin has been committed to helping the people build their own happy life with high-quality and intimate services, advocating that consumers establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively respond to the call for supervision to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young groups, with practical actions.
Over the past few years, Jixin has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and subtracted the consumer demand of young people through various forms such as the competition in cooperation with top universities in China to guide the consumer demand of young people, helping them to establish rational consumption concepts and rationally plan consumer demand, thereby helping them to accumulate their wealth of life.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jixin reminded all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid misunderstandings of consumer borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan in advance, and the strength is to be paid back on time.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the economic life of buying a car and buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, we will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly update the iterative financial products, bring more suitable needs and diversified services to consumers, continuously help the public to improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and do consumers' trusted consumer financial partners for life.

Vietnam's People's Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council tackles common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stoppages include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since the embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In the midst of the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups while having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have severely affected the intra-Seaon unity, negatively affecting the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab states have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the GCC summit in January 2021, where the Gulf states signed an agreement to mediate from the United States and Kuwait towards "solidarity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar by the two countries.
Gulf Arab countries defuse their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, which is a requirement that countries must unite for the interests of countries and regional stability, and are aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi crown prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
Connecting the 725km-long passage between the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and businesses from both countries have signed a 13-billion-dollar memorandum of understanding on cooperation.
The Saudi crown prince ’ s visit to the Gulf comes coinciding with the world ’ s major countries to negotiate an agreement condemned by Gulf Arab states for saving the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Gulf Arab states have argued cannot be resolved.
Gulf states have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and see Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that without resolving the Iranian missile issue, it is flawed to refrain from taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the failure of major powers and Iran's nuclear talks to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia has direct talks with Iran.
The goal is to contain an escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar has concluded.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that contribute to the restoration of the reunification of the GCC, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

The low-slung body, the arrogant scissors door, the huge intakes throughout the body and the 6.5 v12 engine at the bottom of the glass perfectly illustrate the style of Lamborghini.
For the instructions of the car, you don't need to say too much, you're good at Google, and the small compilation has sorted out some of the explanations that Google doesn't have to give!
Too much attention, where everyone is watching, it's not comfortable! (It's a little cool)
1km oil money around RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
Get up and off the pose to practice, or it's a little awkward (because you'll crawl the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud and will be deaf after getting off. (But it's still cool)
The body is too big, the parking space will be very narrow, afraid of being knocked to the next car when the door opened!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (small editor of himself, has nothing to do with the owner, haha)

Let the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate with the same frequency - Xinhua
The so-called spirit of the university refers to a series of school-running concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of development, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been crucial for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, social development, and even the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has shouldered the unique mission different from other social organizations, for China's university, the rise of the national crisis autumn, its spirit is deeply affected by the traditional culture and times changes, advocating the value of "Mingdejie, Xiji Jiping" and "singing strong country" patriotic responsibility.
At present, the trend of information and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, the global education competition, scientific and technological competition, and the competition for talents are increasing, and the cause of higher education as an important "supply side", and its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the "Overall Plan for the Coordinated Promotion of World First-class Universities and First-class Disciplines", while demonstrating the confidence and determination of China to move from a country with a big country of higher education to a strong country in higher education, has put forward higher and renewed requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to become the world's first-class ranks in a relatively short period of time, and on the basis of still a certain gap, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, to achieve "corner overtaking"?
In addition to the firm goal of self-confidence, path self-confidence, ability and self-confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the advantages of latecomers, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learn to learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve the academic level and the quality of the school; the second is the cultural advantage, inherit the wisdom of Chinese civilization in the five thousand years of wisdom, carry forward the development of excellent traditional culture, in order to shape the brand, the image of the system, the advantages of the system, the advantages of the socialist country, the focus of the system, the focus of the consensus, the allocation of resources, to provide sustainable.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university, and each school must highlight its personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school must not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal positioning, school tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to the characteristics of three aspects in running a school: First, we highlight the characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurship talent training, build an integrated education environment for scientific education, and form a whole-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; the second is to highlight the interdisciplinary interdisciplinary characteristics, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary disciplines and the iconic cross-cutting achievements of interdisciplinary disciplines; Third, highlight the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the Pan-Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the "seeking innovation" school motto, "hard work, shrine, distinguishing, solid" common values and "Hainajiang River, Qi Zhen Hude, former people, tree China" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, and the continuous accumulation of cultural heights and the cohesive spiritual strength, which has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, the "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the "world talents for my use" mind, which is manifested in the high-quality concept of absorbing the world famous schools and educating people; the emphasis on "Qing Zhende" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and the good, which refers to the university in the pursuit of truth, and the purity of personality; "pre-people before the people" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, both the new knowledge, scientific research and innovation, and the development of the new.The fate of the nation is with the common humiliation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year school.
"The clear hears the silence, the bright person sees the immovable."
Chinese universities should further be based on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the position of the times and the historical mission of the cause of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we will adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times and the national spirit stir each other, so as to provide inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

Seeing a news about the stock price of friends, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises in the track, that is, the choice of the industry, the first to choose the growth space of the industry, at least 100 billion market size; secondly, to choose the future growth of the good industry, consider the industry after the next 3-5 years to achieve the best of the industry; finally, to choose a policy-supported industry.
How wide the track refers to the size of the market, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Fuel for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to sum up the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is "do the things right," which is to do things right.
The strategy is “do the right thing ”, which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is to find the direction, the tactic is to land, in most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactic thinking) above, you can think whether it is continuous deepening in the current field or horizontal extension (strategic thinking); for example, improving customer retention (tactic thinking) above, can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on the basis of increasing activity participation (tactic thinking), can consider how to set the right activities KPI, to achieve the right activity goals, such as improving customer engagement, act high-value silence customers, accurately pull new; on the upgrading of DAU (tactical thinking), can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

Asian American groups complain about discrimination in admissions of three famous colleges such as Yale - Xinhua
More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd to protest against three popular colleges - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College in the admissions process to discriminate against Asian-American applicants during the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, president of the group, said at the launch that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission conditions of prestigious schools in the United States has doubled over the past decade, but the proportion of Asians in the three U.S. schools is basically at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" of admissions, "long-term sustainability and systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants to students."
Zhao Yukong said that in 2014, research by scholars such as Sanders showed that in the three colleges and universities, the number of Asians has the lowest acceptance rate among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest rate of admission to Asian-American students, and Yale and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua that after they expected to submit their complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice would be able to investigate and take steps to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after they decided the facts.
They also expect the complaints colleges to take the initiative to focus on this issue and change their admissions policies for Asians.
At present, the three universities that have been complained of have not yet responded.
Founded in 2015, the Asian American Education Alliance complained about Harvard's admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the complaint includes American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani-based educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing intermediary that a factory in Yu Yao Shuting Town, Zhejiang Province, and after looking at the house on multiple occasions, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, after consulting with Lin Mou, the family of the owner of the property, Mr. Lu, sent a deposit of RMB20 million by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin in the "plant sale and purchase deposit collection" on the signature of the recipient, it is stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this deposit belongs to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, the two sides agreed to sign a factory sales contract within a week."
However, after that, the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the main terms of the scope of the plant and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin returned the two hundred thousand yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
It was hard to see the house, the deposit was paid, the room was ready, and it was too "one foot in the door" to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell it, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sue Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the parties could not be attributed to the defendant only if they were unable to conclude a formal contract, and should reasonably be presumed to be that consultations would not be the failure, so the case should not apply the fine penalty, and the defendant did not need to bear the liability for double the return of the deposit.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original sentence.
[Lawyer reminds] to fulfill the necessary duty of care in the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer should fulfill the necessary duty of care, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and clarify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent the parties in the performance of the contract.
After the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11th) that the United States' hosting of the "Leadership Summit" is "drawing the ideological line, instrumentalizing democracy, carrying out anti-democracy facts in the name of democracy, inciting divisive confrontation, and shifting domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted the 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated the 'color revolution', which has disastrous consequences."
“Democracy has long been a weapon of mass destruction ” for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit was an action by which Biden delivered on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting took place by video, with 111 leaders from around the world invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia slammed the United States for its own democracy, saying that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also questioning voices in the international and U.S. countries, such as those invited to the meeting, including those with authoritarian authoritarian tendencies, such as those in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some doubt that the Biden administration's real intention is not to organize the summit for democratic but for geopolitical purposes.
Just-in-a-deprelator Scholz also attended the video democracy summit.
China ’ s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that “today ’ s American democracy is sickly, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, party antagonism, political polarization, social laceration, racial contradictions, and rich-poor divisions, ” and that American democracy is a ‘ game for the rich ’ on capital.
In his speech, US President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of the administration, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent accountability, to be more resistant to the forces of authoritarianism and shocks, and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted, "we must constantly update it in every generation, and in my opinion, it is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that democracy and human rights need fighters to defend at a time of ongoing and worrisome challenges.
The U.S. side has promised a one-year action following this summit of democracy, which includes an initiative of $4.244 billion to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic system ahead of the planned substantive democracy summit at the end of 2022.
“Let all of us implement our commitments and report on the progress we ’ ve made next year. ”
All right, I'm just afraid he's sending the wrong address.

What is a red whisky drink?
Everyone's hobbies are different, some people like the collection, some people like food, of course, there are people like to taste wine, red-branded whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in various countries, and red-branded whisky has won the International Wine Competition Gold Award.
Every bottle of red whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it doesn't spoil its mellow.
How to drink red whisky?
Small series for everyone to briefly introduce.
Red whisky drinking:
The whisky is made of about 35 Scotch whisky blends, which have rich aroma and traditional Scotch whisky, with sweet and smoky aromas.
Inlet is fresh, with a slightly vanilla and a strong smoky malt.
The wine can be consumed directly or mixed with a favorite drink.
Red-branded whisky enters the country, and in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, sparkling drinks such as red-branded whisky + cola or Sprite or noveltymakers have become a enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to the delicious sour taste, can visually bring pleasure to people, add the beverage, play a light wine taste to change the taste of the effect.
Red-branded whisky + sliced lemon + square sugar (shallows can also be) is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
Authentic red square has a little sour, adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, lemon will bring fresh aroma to the wine, of course, sweet and sourness can be blended according to personal tastes.
The above three are the best drinking methods of red whisky, and you can use it as a reference to try, and I hope that the introduction of the small series can help everyone.
Educational thinking: How to make the "study bully" and "scum" each get its own - Xinhua
Three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leaders, reflecting the confusion of the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the exam, change the exam type, so that the exam can truly reflect the actual level of students' demands.
Indeed, for a long time, college exams have been a "hot topic"
On the university campus, students come from all over the world, and the level of ability varies, and the degree of study varies widely.
For groups with such multiple characteristics to assess, there are different feelings, it is inevitable.
Of course, if the exam question type is single and the repetition rate is high, the topic is too simple, it will inevitably cause another very different feeling.
Students who do not have meritorious students may be able to pass the relevant assault before taking the exam, and if you think of other ways, you may achieve the effect of doing more with less.
In this way, there will be "study scum" usually do not invest in the customs, and even get high scores; "school bully" usually never falls, homework, notes are good, the exam is not much higher than the "weird status quo".
In this way, Lanzhou Jiaotong University students reflect that the problems in the university exam are not without any reason, and believe that this situation does not only exist in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should like to praise the three students who write letters.
In fact, people who have been in college are well aware that it is not uncommon for people to prepare for the exam, think of various ways to "take" the exam from the teacher, and strive to get the scope of the exam, and it is not uncommon to get "key tutoring" before the exam, and even in the examination to ask the teacher to raise the noble hand.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment orientation, the measure of whether a university exam is qualified or not depends on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific propositions on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate level, the majors began to subdivide, and many professional courses are based on the basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content of the university examination.
The basic undergraduate knowledge is the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline, from the point of view, the space for change is not large, basically fixed.
As some teachers have said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics in college twenty years ago is still learning, and it is still the focus."
However, the knowledge point is basically unchanged, and does not mean that the exam type is single and the test question is repeated.
In many universities, the exam will generally form a question group, and then the senior teachers in the discipline will be composed of the examination paper, and the examination volume is also carried out by all the teachers of the department, so that the test question can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, in order to formulate a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning, the topic is difficult to show the normal distribution according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of student learning, so that the exam proposition is difficult and the problem type is dynamically grasped, both to highlight the basic knowledge, but also to take into account the ability to examine, and at the same time to innovate the design of the question type.
Exam is the baton of university education, what kind of exam, students will have the corresponding preparation program, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the students' letter of advice, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the deployment of rectification programs in the whole school.
Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and course-end exams against self-examination, formulate examination test paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of test papers propositions and audit links, refine the evaluation of achievements, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the type of test type, the problem of repetition of the topic is the need for the university examination needs to face the topic, of course, need to introduce the corresponding system, but the daily work, the need for teachers to a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the content of teaching, but also to eat through the students' learning situation, teaching and learning will be better docked, the examination will be better aligned, the examination will be more in line with the actual, so that "s" and "s."

In the selection of photos, because I see a lot of cases on the Internet, I don't want to let guests delete too many photos, but when we choose photos, really, there is no meaning of the picture, directly in the package of 24, not a single addition (I heard and I almost the time to take wedding photos, more than seven thousand packages also add more than ten thousand photos, I was shocked at that time, I was also afraid that I would choose too much)
Today the photo was repaired, Lanland sent me, and I saw two things that I didn't feel good, and they helped me re-reply immediately.
Turning out the pictures my sister used to take, I think our photos I'm really too happy with, simple and fresh, and that's the style I want.

Sabah3200 newborn babies without reported raw paper due to special anti-counterfeiting paper out of stock
The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that due to the use of special anti-counterfeiting paper inventory, it has not been possible to issue raw paper for newborn babies since early October, and the accumulated number of affected people has reached 3200 people.
However, the director of the bureau, Kerou Amirus, has assured that all babies who have applied for paper have been recorded in the system and that anti-counterfeiting paper will be reissued once they are shipped next week.
At a press conference, he explained the ten-month-long report on the issue of paper printing in Sabah that Sabah reported.
He said the question arose two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
"One reason is that Chinese manufacturers who produce special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed transportation to our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah paper was different from that of other regions, so it was not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kairu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed it over to the printing company on the 8th to carry out some printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, back to Sabah and immediately carry out the final stage of printing, and it is estimated that more than two working days (December 20th) can be handed over to the applicant."
"We will not inform the applicant to go to local bureaus to collect the paper."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 2,4801 copies of paper so far this year.
From seven o'clock to now.
Is that coming fast?
I mean food.
I'm going to #PRS_ORG# across the opposite side.
Good, thank you, because the restaurant says it's ready

Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11th (Reporter Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in the port city, requiring personnel who have recently left the land border port city (except for Hong Kong and Macao ports).
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is that from the date on which the port city scope is determined from the provinces, regions and cities and the announcement, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the CDC of the National Health and Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and border exchanges between the two sides are frequent.
The implementation of zoning differentiation management policy, from a prevention and control of spillover defense line into two lines of defense, is expected to achieve the forward movement of the threshold, compress the risk of epidemic spillover, with the minimum social impact, the minimum social cost to achieve the greatest results of epidemic prevention and control.
Recently, there have been a number of local congregate epidemics in China, which are imported by the port city of overseas epidemics.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed the lack of timely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, closed-loop management of high-risk posts, regular nucleic acid testing in the form, the inauguration of all aspects of cold chain items, the irregular management of centralized isolation places, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
Notice requirements, from the improvement of the port city epidemic prevention and control mechanism, improve the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, the implementation of border control measures and other nine aspects of efforts, speed up the filling of the port city prevention and control shortcomings, do a good job in prevention and control without relaxation, scientific precision to do a good job of prevention and control, weting in a tight line of defense.
The notice stressed that all port cities should study and simultaneously the prevention and control of the epidemic and people's livelihood security work, simultaneously deploy the epidemic prevention and control work, publish and unblock the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check the hidden dangers of basic living materials supply, price, etc., and solve and proactively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to therein include open land, waterway, air port area of the county (city, district, flag), the city (land, state, alliance) and the municipalities directly under the Central Government, the specific scope of the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control to determine and timely announcement.

Pipeline video bottoms U.S. military's bloodthirsty killing truth in 2020 - Xinhua
(Video source: tubing)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the pipeline platform drew widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States' war in Afghanistan under the name of "terrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through war, militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminately killing innocents, and committing all kinds of crimes against humanity.
Abusing drones to airstrikes on civilian sites such as hospitals and schools, distorting humanity, and setting up homicide teams.
For 20 years, U.S. forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has "black jail" to inflict all kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects".
A crime against humanity has stirred hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the American "war on terror" is "more and more anti-fear of terror."
The war has not brought peaceful democracy and hope for prosperity to the Afghan people, and only the devastated country and countless killings have been destroyed.
Put the video together to debunk the truth of America's bloodthirsty killing in the name of "counter-terrorism", and poked the false face of American democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from the perspective of business and the storage period to talk about why this customer to bonded area inside the logistics company to help do canned, although canned is deep processing, does not belong to the scope of the bonded logistics company's business, here is the following text may explain why customers want to do so?
I go to a lot of milk powder manufacturers, contact a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bag and the milk powder their raw materials are the same, there is no difference.
Then you will definitely ask: why the bag shelf life is a year, and the shelf life of listening is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so expensive?
In fact, from this point of view of many consumers, or mother-level people think that this is because the raw materials are not the same, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the same raw materials, just people think that expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mentality after eating the reaction and also said that the taste or taste of the listening is not the same!
Now I'm going to tell you the reason for hearing about the expensive, where is it?
Why is the same raw material difference?
Because manufacturers in the pricing of most people are considering that if the bag pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or there is no profit, then what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big uptick in the pricing of listening to it to secure their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly push the listening, not bagging.
There are so many manufacturers you think that the annual advertising cost tens of millions or even hundreds of millions, what is this cost?
Everyone can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion of the market, such as: shopping mall promoters, shopping mall display costs, product gift fees, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and listening, and their prices are constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product with the increase of market fees.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials increase the cost of up to 3 or 4 dollars.
There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, unsatisfied with the hospital doctors, by them to assist the promotion of products, from a hearing into a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such an operation method, in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder in the cans at home, so that you can save money, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no impact on children.
There are also people who don't think that the shelf life of the hearing is longer than the bag, if after the bag listening and the shelf life is the same, just say that the bag is not easy to save after the bag, easy to fade.
The food delivery was late, the food was cold, cold and hard, and I couldn't eat it.

Don't scare people to the starting line - Xinhua
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Today's successful books, many of the things that preach are the "best principles", that is, assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do.
It is tantamount to saying that it has suddenly crossed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
That's why these books have a common feature - either to do it to the best, or you'll just do nothing; it's 100 or it's zero; you're going to Taim, or you're going to be in Tarith, or you're just going to be there.
This "best principle", let anyone see will admit "correct and incomparable", but 99% of people will be intimidated in front of the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of “you have to make a hard decision, to be a big change of 180 degrees, ” and that ’ s the fatal weakness of many people.
For people who are conformist, discipline, and refuse to change, you are biased to shout "you want to change" in your ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and plays the bulls.
The vast majority of people will be timid in front of the word "transformation", can not be wrapped in, difficult to resolve; or with a moment of impulsive pain to "transform" the determination, and bravely take the first step, but often good times, can not hold on a short time to lose, difficult to see the continuity.
The sound of Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "Start with Tomorrow" is the most transmitted expression of this "universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of the ability of ordinary people, so that the vast majority of people are "speaking up."
Perhaps, the “secondary principle ” is a way to make more ordinary people embark on the path of relative success.
The core of the "second-good principle" is "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "small wins and big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, you can't do it only: because 1 is never greater than 0; if you can't climb Taishan, you only climb the small sand dunes at your doorstep, because it is always stronger than the original.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not doing anything.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, it will make ordinary people more likely to persist, and as long as everything is adhered to, the probability of success will increase.
Only to follow the "secondary principle" of success, the road is slightly longer.
All in all, the “best principle ”, although on the surface, is in the name of making everyone succeeds, but it is ultimately able to motivate everyone in the end, in fact, it is still a minority; and the“ second-best principle ” can effectively incentivize more people and benefit more people as much as possible.

Qinghai Lake naked carp reserves increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Xining December 11th (Reporter Locke Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the latest monitoring results show that the amount of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources increased by 0.71 million tons compared with the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons, compared with the early stage of 2002 protection, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times.
The name "Sichuan fish" is a unique precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp pyrocarp pyres and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of Qinghai Lake was sharply reduced, and the amount of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons in 2002.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lake-based fish, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual fishing for naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and Lake District, and the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release and the clean-up of Qinghai Lake mainly into the lake river channel, the design of scientific and reasonable "fish channel" and other measures continue to increase protection, Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserves have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, Qinghai Lake naked carp has accumulated nearly 1.8 billion tails of artificial proliferation and release, and the contribution rate to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 23%.
Qinghai Sanjiangyuan is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan region and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Plateau, Qinghai has issued the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake key waters, and has built a comprehensive no-holds management system for "one river, one river, one lake" ban on fishing.

It's been an hour, it hasn't been sent.
Just saw an article writing an article that was too long.
Give the unknown to the male.
Most girls will suddenly experience the first holiday one day during the age of 13-15, and are about 50 years old.
After the health will come more regularly once a month.
But it is not regular to predict accurately, about a week or so of the tolerance, need to prepare in advance, sometimes bad luck will roll over (auddenly a few days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, the degree of dysmenorrhiety varies from person to person, some people for three days, some people a week; some people flow less, some people have no blood collapse; some people do not have a lot of trouble, some people have no pain to the ambulance, and the pain does not mean that they have no pain for a lifetime.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, begins to bleed 24 hours in the days to end, and all you can do is use a sanitary towel or tampons to suck blood to prevent flow to a chair on the dress.
The dysmenorrhea is mainly because of the secretion of prostaglandin, the physiological period has not had time to eat ibuprofen when the pain is not in time for pain to effectively alleviate the pain of the month, and it is not useful to eat after the pain begins.
Before the physiological period, due to the excessive uterus congestion and prostaglandin release, it is easy to pull the stomach.
If it is about to the cycle, inexplicably, the stomach will basically come to menstruation within two days.
It is best to replace the sanitary napkin twice or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, remove the sleep time, the worst case is to change six times a day, 7 days a month, that is, 42 tablets, if you add a portion of the pre-prepared may be 50 tablets, not a single piece per month.
(Amat it here, the tampons do not have to change normally, about five or six hours change, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormone may be more irastimatic, ovulation period will also be because of hormonal changes in the body emotional instability, is very unlucky, the body gives itself a stumbling block.
But official crime data can show that women's ability to control emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional problems to make excuses.
The flow is not just blood, it contains the endometrium that falls off.
After the end of the period, the end of the uterus is the thinnest, and then slowly thicken, can be understood as the uterus is a house, every month to build a house (the endometrium thickened) ready to meet the guests, the guests did not come, all decommissioned (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, cycle after the cycle.
Menstruation is inconvenient, for decades, a few days of 24 hours a month bleeding, there will be abdominal pain and low back pain, who would like?
But people can be born because his mother came to menstruation, menstruation is to prepare you for the first time in this world to live in a ten-month house, everyone wants to pay attention to their mother's normal health of the menstrual period.
In the past, many things of women were suppressed, and society gave women brainwashed to say that it was dirty and ashamed, and everyone thought that was the same, but the times changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, I think that the female body is ready to give birth to life nausea, should not be in the public to say it, the girls stand up, do not think so, never experienced, will not experience in this life, do not know how to understand the male, do not forget the wrong, this attitude is how to face their mother, how to want their children?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons, which is really good to use.
Today is the winter solstice festival, sending mistakes is more disappointing
Order other meals for children.
I hope the store is busy to check out the product.
Is the foot throbed of the drop-off?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot therapy, today the United States will answer this question, I hope to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are more and more loved by consumers, and a large number of different products have emerged in the market, from a hundred and more yuan to thousands of yuan of foot bathtubs, giving consumers a lot of choice space.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health home appliances such as foot bathtubs are hot, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety hazards.
"To soak your feet in a charged water is so dangerous."
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father to make a birthday gift, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt the soles of his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought that it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, and did not expect to close the vibration function, and the father still felt the hemp on the soles of the feet.
Mr. Li made an electric test, the electric pen actually lit up, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, the attitude of the business is still good, although he withdrew the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that the long-standing foot bath is now in the maximum temperature setting, what kind of people it applies, and what materials are guaranteed to be harmless, there is not a clear and detailed industry regulation.
However, in general, the foot bath is that there will not be a problem with electrically charged, but it is not ruled out that a small number of products are not strictly closed when they are out of the factory.
Therefore, at the time of purchase, choose a split foot bath.
Hydropower separation, without any safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take the electric test.

Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation to our difficult group of Mothers Tiananmen, which should have drawn the perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your deeds will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Taoye: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid for the United States (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the course of humanitarian assistance, the United States Students and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the program's executioners often intersect.

The rescue money is often not delivered smoothly to the six or four difficulties.
In 1994, according to the suggestion of Mr. Ding, a special group was set up by the "Tiananmen Mother" to coordinate the reception and distribution of the funds for the rescue of the person in charge.
In 1998, MCDF set up the June Fourth Orphan Education Fund, which was implemented 11 years later, in 2009, after graduating from all six or four orphans in college, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Lonely Elderly Specially Dilemma Family Rescue Fund", and has been implemented to this day.
The projects, funded mainly from the June Fourth year's campus and social donations, came from generous donations from individuals and were supported by the fraternal University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, six or four difficulties finally received a portion of the donations collected from Hong Kong in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Human Rights in China was also independently implementing their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called for the suspension of the June 4th donation, for the donor consideration, we are indeed some retired elderly people, income is not as sufficient before retirement, I hereby thank Teacher Ding's "to friend" a letter.
We will respect the decision of the Difficulties to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately when needed.
For those chivalrous peers who have been insisting on generosity over the years and taking the risk of delivering humanitarian aid payments, they are grateful and respectfully.

Not to mention Mr. Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The entire studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and two small cats are playing with you.
We are working in Beijing, Beijing good spot studio need to line up half a year in advance, colleagues have filmed in Beijing, watching the next film feel so so so so so so.
I searched for this studio, a place with a soul with attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, I think this is also the short version of most people, the photographer Liang brother will capture, record the natural wonderful moment.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-design, a well-rounded team.
We and the people around us are raving.
I have recommended my girlfriends to pass, and the girlfriend has just seen the negatives.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, more people find ta, film their own style, rather than the same.

If you are planning to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if there is no idea of this, it is best to self-study, after all, the training costs a lot of money, and it will take six months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have self-control and their weak, training is a very good choice.
If your own self-control is relatively strong, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, it depends on the faculty strength of this institution, if the teacher strength is not strong enough, this training institution will have little significance, of course, some of the newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Second, before choosing this training institution, it is best to explore the students of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is, and the course is good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer this question, because you don't have a certain introduction to your own situation, and there is a lot to do with learning this thing and the personal situation.
For example, a professional, age, language you want to learn, or even in which city, these will have something to do with the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or computer science has graduated, then if enough time is my personal advice to self-study, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, now a lot of offline training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, more time investment, basic need to focus on training 3-6 months.
But if I say these things, it is convenient for self-study, now a lot of learning resources on the network are free, or there are a lot of training resources to go to the b station, if you will not find resources, you can also contact me through the profile, get free resources, or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but you can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to go to the training institution to study, so it is not necessary to study hard, the teacher explains it in detail, there are also people to answer specifically, in addition to learning planning or supervision in the aspects of the help.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal places, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the job search interview link can also save a lot of things.
The above is some of my views, because you do not know your situation, so it is only probably not detailed, if you have other things you want to consult, you can contact me to communicate.
I said 1 o'clock, I saw it in the app.

Chinese and Saudi curators jointly hold Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale - Xinhua
RIYADH (Reporter Wang Haizhou Hu Guan) The first annual exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia, the Dilyye Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the DilierJAX Art District, northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, and a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The Biennale was co-curated by the Saudi Diary-New Year Foundation and the China UCCA Ullens Contemporary Art Center, and the director of the UCC Ullens Contemporary Art Center in China, as artistic director Tian Feiyu.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this Biennale is "Touching Stones across the River", and the reform strategy adopted in the period of socio-economic transformation is also a reflection of the current situation of Saudi Arabia's socio-cultural development.
The Biennale covers nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Touching Stone Crossing the River", "Inheritance as an experiment", "Edge Thinking", "To the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of works of 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than four percent of the total number of exhibits, including paintings, installations, and performing arts. Twelve Chinese artists' works are also concerned, and some artists use recycled materials in a novel way to create, such as Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste in the "Indeterred Map of the Story series" (2014).
Barkley, CEO of the Dilye Biennale Foundation, expressed hope that this Biennale will establish an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's burgeoning cultural industry and creative communities and enhance interaction.
"The goal of the Biennale is twofold, which can allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, but also to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art," Tian said.
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the Biennale Week, where artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinated and standardized rural public welfare post management - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in helping people out of poverty and consolidating and expanding the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies to promote the management of rural public welfare posts to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial People's Social Affairs Department, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 44.83 million rural public welfare jobs, which are used to place the employment of rural difficult groups such as the poverty alleviation labor force, and play an important role in helping the people out of poverty to achieve employment and income, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of rural public services.
The new regulations are jointly issued by the Yunnan People's Society, Rural Revitalization, Finance and other seven departments, mainly for the grass-roots recruitment of rural public welfare personnel object scope, fund management, job development, job management and other aspects of unified norms.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations are clear, and in accordance with the principles of "based on-demand, fixed personnel, dynamic management, total amount control", "who developed, who used, who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary open, and unified management" were set up.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-service training and arrangement of induction.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development department of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that the development departments of rural public welfare jobs should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare job placement personnel; require relevant departments to regularly supervise the issuance of subsidies for rural public welfare posts.
The address is wrong.
Hello to
Can the order be cancelled
I re-argued the order.
Has it been cancelled
Second, although the right has a time of determination in history, but not long, so it is short because it is brightly sunny, and you sweat when you drink some boiling water; you have a little ambition to look forward to it, and the Mao will be attached to it.
But in terms of truth-to-fact, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right from the aspects of ending the definition of truth standards, developing the economy to improve science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection should not be denied.
Third, as far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his statement, and I also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China and takes China seriously on China's social issues.
But I am opposed to his anti-communist theory, I think the anti-necessary revolution, the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, the people's livelihood is damaged, the political groups are mixed with mud, and then the foreign countries take advantage of it.
Fourth, change or improve China's attitude of being patient and responsible for the country, political speculation attempts to take the  Chends in the fire, it is not the right, it is the jerk.
Talk about the left again.
Left, in fact, is a gang of times and outcasts of politics.
If the right has a positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right words and analyze their thoughts when it is needed, then there is no such thing as the left, because the left is exactly the dross that the Communist Party has thrown away!
V. Recently, I have seen some friends while taut at the back of the back of the left, and it is quite true, I think it is necessary not to.
Don't try to reason with the traitor and the left, it's all a baggle, it's unreasonable.
Don't try to prove us right, and don't think about letting anti-thigry and left-wieldly admit it?
I tell my friends this way: When the anti-thigue scolds you for five hairs, when the left scolds your right dog, it just proves that our middle way is right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, and when they are old, they forget the ideal, or pursue the ideal, but they become paranoia.
And the ideal drift away, and even the dragon-sweed boy eventually became a dragon.
I think generally refers to constraints and freedom, and China's innate genes from history and culture, which leads to China as a whole, should be left-left.
The domestic right is free, focusing on efficiency and development, and the left strengthens supervision, and pays more attention to fairness and security.
Now that society generally wants to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, China and the United States are competing, and the left is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, I'm good after the praise.
I can't say anything, flowering is so righteous.
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei's chips by the United States emperor has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "American" enterprises.
The United States suppressed China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and relevant companies of allies to block China's chip industry at the same time, the direct result is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in reduced R & D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, resulting in a shortage of chip supply chain disorder on the world.
Now that the "lack of core" has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies to stop production, mobile phone price increases, almost all the use of chips in the industry is deeply affected.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips", more and more technology giants in more and more countries have begun to move on the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control, contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the recent old American action frequently, is to host the "chip summit"; is to invite the 64-nation giants to set up a semiconductor alliance, and to support the United States of China's local technology giants, for example, the old-fashioned technology giant Intel in order to regain the dominance of the chip field, spent $200 billion in the United States Arizona to build a 2-point wafer processing plant, and open the chip foundry business.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl loomed ra"
The reason for this affirmation is that Intel, as an old technology giant in the field of American, has been deeply cultivated in the field of semiconductors for decades, and has a large talent team and technical reserves, which will surely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongquan was dismissive.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made an amazing speech, and for Intel's spending on the fumes of the fab, Zhang Zhongquan said without any scruples: Intel built a chip foundry, quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou was quite dismissive of Intel's in-fiques wafers because Zhang Zhongmou still worried about a period of enthusiasm for TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the American imperial manufacturing industry, which ranks in the global position, and is the hegemon of the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been mastered by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were completed by a factory from design, manufacturing to sealing, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged in the face of huge production line construction costs.
In the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear in the phenomenon of division of labor, in 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there is a special chip design company, it is believed that since there is a special design, then you can set up a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC's main business is aimed at the "wafer processing" of this single link, not designed, only to provide wafer manufacturing foundry services.
At that time, the TSMC, which had just been founded, was a small company in front of the big Mac.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had found Intel to invest, but at that time, as soon as Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obviously a little self-receitious, looking down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer process services at the time.
I didn't expect that the giants that looked down on wafer manufacturing services, but now they have to start doing wafer foundry.
So, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel entered the wafer foundry is ironic.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel is naturally afraid to fix itself.
Today, TSMC has sprinted toward the 3nm chip, while Intel is still stuck in 14nm seven years ago.
Wanting to catch up is not easy.

It was 2 hours 😅 to place the order by 19: 06.
Let ’ s take a look at some strange hot search today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Dragon head up, good Liyou price increase, pull the event, public opinion spread to form a peak, and then [the index decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, if the secondary public opinion there will be small hump again.
They look like they are no different from the [network public opinion evolution model] that the official website of the Internet Information Office has shown.
What is an unusual public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches in the same event, showing [Lonely Peak], "saw-toothing", [cliff-like].
[Lonely peak] That is, artificial heating, quickly rushed to the hot search, causing public concern; [saw-too-hissing] that is, periodic heating, to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; [cliff-like] is the collective evacuation, the hot search to play a "function", received a new task, rushed to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of an event happens to be the valley of another event, and the time is not bad, and it must be a unified batch of water troops to receive the task and open a new round of offensives.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searchs at the same time, which attracts the attention, which is responsible for popular science, which leads the battle, which diversions, which affects the cognition, which misleads the judgment, which incites emotions, and what is wrapped in decision-making, the black production account is divided into batches, and the nodes are refined into combat, almost considering all the elements of the spread of public opinion.
Dissemination is a science, put aside the position, all subjective factors, from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
All who pass by will leave traces, such traces, and we dig them out together.

Countries such as Mauritius have found first case of Omicron strain infection - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 12th Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency foreign correspondent reports: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant of the Omicron strain.
Mauritius has reported two cases of the Omicron strain on the 10th.
According to Minister of Health of Mao, Kaylesg Jaguttpar, an infected person who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; another infected person is a local resident of Mauritius, who tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned to South Africa.
After being treated in isolation from the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced the first confirmed case of three cases of the Omicron strain in the country.
All three were students who came back from a trip abroad earlier this month, and were not admitted to the hospital because they were all mildly ill.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Serbian government has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to November 10th next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the plane are required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The health ministry also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children from the country to the age of 5 to 11 of the Pfizer coronavirus.
Malawi's health minister, Knquibize Chipunda, said on the 9th that the country had first detected three cases of the Omicron strain.
The country's health department carried out genome sequencing of 12 new coronavirus-positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and found the three cases of infection.

At first, it was a friend who introduced the trust, so I chose to look at the first time my budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
I started a series of tricks in the store.
I was the first time I went to the store just showed them my household chart, they did not go to the field to count the house, they actually can give me a quote to me that my 135 house of seventy thousand can be done, probably show me their material and do not know what kind of branded material they are.
Their second set of deception is that if you go to the store, you will drag you to pay the deposit (and once the money is handed over, you will never get out of it, unless you have enough experience to fight the theoretical war with them.
When I hesitate to pay a deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you how much we can give you today.
This is a big pit, and I am an example of life being deceived, and in the impulsive mind, I have more than ten thousand deposits.
There are a lot of questions he gave me for a few of the seven million do not include the hydroelectric makeover, excluding any doors and cupboard bathrooms, and these three are the base costs of the big head.
Excluding these of their service points is also higher than other companies.
I lost trust in the company and asked me to sign a contract without any clarity at the beginning.
When I go to them to withdraw money, they show a very experience, and there are a dedicated team to deal with you.
It is a customer ’ s problem that you ’ re completely unaccounted for anyway.
All kinds of shirk of responsibilities, there are many details, do not want to say that it is tears, in short, do not choose them, because my friends to find them to decorate the house is also of bad quality, the later cost to you.
Pit Dad, they were the original deceit of the fascours of the decoration, and now it is changed to great beauty, as if they closed down and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a pit dad's renovation company.
In the future, when you choose, you will take a look at these inquiries because the decoration is not small money.
To ask a business, please log in or register first
It is strictly forbidden to publish various forms of merchant review, please see the merchant's inclusion statement in detail

OK, then don't cancel this conversation, if you don't retire my money for five to 10 days, you'll be sure to pursue it.
I asked if 15 minutes could not be cancelled.

Starry sky is about Gemini meteor shower 14th ushered in great - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Tianjin December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian) As an astronomical science expert introduction, as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will be greatly ushered in on December 14th, and friends who like meteor showers can observe in the middle of the night after the same day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjuo's Gemini meteor shower, pictured in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor shower's parent objects are periodic comets, but the parent object of the twin meteor shower is the 3200 asteroid Fahá'a, an Apollo-type asteroid.
Geminid meteor shower is also currently known as the second meteor shower, which is not "produced" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert on astronomy science, said that just like the big blockbuster of the new year, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release period" can last from December 4th to the 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its high flow and stability, and is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, along with the Quadrant meteor shower and the Perseus meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroid is slow, rich in color, and a lot of meteors are also numerous, which are suitable for visual viewing and suitable for astrophotography beginners for shooting.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing's Geminid meteor shower photographed in Tianjin Thistle State on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will be extremely large on December 14th at 15th, with the maximum time ZHR (with the ideal observation point at the top of the head, when the number of meteors can be seen per hour) is 150.
Gemini meteor shower Recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'lost' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the degree of wonderfulness will be discounted.
The 14th is the lunar November 11th, the moon phase is a bright moon, the bright moonlight will cause interference to the observation, so after the middle of the night the moon will fall, at this time the Gemini meteor shower radiation point will also rise higher.
Friends who like the meteor shower can observe these hours after the middle of the night, but pay attention to cold and warm. "
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a high altitude, small light damage, the northeast direction of the view is open, and then patiently wait until the moon is falling, visual observation can be seen."
It should be noted that the flow rate of the Gemini meteor shower in all directions is very large, and the observation should not always be viewed at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower.
If you want to shoot a gorgeous 'star shower', it's best to choose a wide-angle, a large aperture lens, and use the high ISO and the largest aperture when shooting.
Due to stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, spare batteries and shutter lines are also essential. ”
Repeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the theme of traditional TV should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TVs in market positioning, there are the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the big screen market.
Compared with the LCD TV fully rolled out the market positioning, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of large screens.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV size is more than 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of the laser TV is generally above 75 inches, the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meet the user's demand for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, laser TV has been increasing in global shipments and sales, accounting for more than six percent of the overall TV sales in 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhong Yikang, in 2020, the laser TV market sales will grow by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason why there is such a good result in the big screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly into the eyeball, compared to the back light source of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation of the eye is also smaller.
China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization Saidi Laboratory and Beijing Concord Hospital ophthalmology experts, through the crowd under the same conditions to watch laser TV and LCD TVs in strict comparison tests, came up with 144 sets of test data.
The data confirms that laser TV does have a strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more valued, laser TV not only attracts more and more users by virtue of the advantages of eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the price of laser TVs currently sold is mostly above ten thousand yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light source, the price has gradually climbed.
Why does laser TV sell so expensive?
Surely it makes sense.
Under the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TVs can not achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is shorter compared to the traditional projection equipment, and can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, the required space is not large, and the host is small, and the location is small.
In terms of brightness, the big brand laser TV can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat is lower, the loss of the equipment is small, and the TV life is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with real 4K Ultra HD picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Not to mention the pseudo-demand, but the product of the demand segmentation, on the size of the picture and the input-output ratio, the laser TV is not the video player's dishes, want to take into account the large screen and the viewing environment is insufficient, you can try, everything is pros and cons, after weighing their own judgment, afraid to listen to a word.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle near-coke projector-laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which does not meet the best design for optics.
In order to shield some ambient light, the MENine curtain with a microstructure is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically change 65 inch LCDs.
And one thing, I especially hate projection manufacturers to carry diffuse reflection on the eyes as a selling point, please, the eyes can see the light on the screen is straight light for the eyes, you reflect to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, it is more true that the LCD TV is also "straight shot", the TV ceiling is also illuminated?
Moreover, the projection screen, if not a diffuse reflection, can not be a portrait at all.
It is precisely the hot spot (spot) effect of the high-gave curtain, and a large amount of light reflects the eye at an angle, which is really difficult.

Add a WeChat appointment date, the little sister will be the optional schedule sent to me, the reply ~ message is more timely ~
Before going to the store to see the filming, more is the outdoor wedding dress, the filming is very beautiful, involved in the shooting style is also a lot.
After the same day and the little sister simply exchanged their thoughts, very patiently to help me try two sets of my tangled style clothes, and finally finalized the start of makeup ~ Photographers will put some props before shooting, will guide the action, and make more excellence for the details.
But it may be because I didn't exchange specific shooting ideas with me, so it's not the style I want, but it's supposed to be a good look 🙊🙊.
After taking a good shot, the photographer will help pick photos, communicate the post-style style, feel very careful horn.
The repaired film takes about half a month, sitting etc. ~
For the second time, the photo-writing overlord meal activity - most of the clothes in the field can choose a shot.
Finally, a black dress was chosen to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about two hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting is the brother after 95, feel a little or a little green, I hope that the customer can give more advice in the future in terms of shooting action guidance.

On the front page, let ’ s take a look at Queenie.
To the store first fill in the name of the phone and then choose the clothing, the wedding dress can be selected, the change of three or four sets of clothing is still very patient, after the selection of makeup for a long time, the service attitude is good, the back film will teach you how to posing the shape, is to shoot out the feeling of a good face, repair said that it is about half a month, three or four days to send, as if the original film is no difference.
The environment as a whole is good.
There are many optional clothes.
There are almost three of the make-up positions, and there is a studio inside.
[Service] is very warm and attentive.
The stylist is patient.
Photographers will also be very careful to teach you how to move.
Unsatisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to make a supplement.
[Experience] Maybe the shape is a little over-the-top, and the original double eyelids have been posted out of the three-eyed skin.
The eyebrows were also shaved, a little embarrassed about the daily unpasted thrush.
The photos were given in ten days, but the P-chart effect was not very satisfactory, and it felt that the eyeslids were still obvious.
Because it is not clear what style to try two sets of results to pick to pick or choose the black dress little sister said that this set is more Heben retro style
After selecting the clothes, I started to make up the hairstylist and the makeup artist and the little sister were very patient, and I was very satisfied with the effect of helping me get it.
After making up the hair, I started to take pictures of the photographer all the time to command my pose, the process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the filming, I carefully selected four favorites when the young brother said that the final of the 15th film was very satisfied.
There was no reply on the 3rd... because your system can't recognize my credit card, I can't join #PRS_ORG# the monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
I'm going to pay the freight every time now.
Can you exempt first, go until you investigate and then charge my monthly fee, so to do so?
Small umbrellas to buy insurance, is it reliable?
The umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: In accordance with the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015)", as an insurance brokerage company, it is necessary to meet three key words: shareholders, promoters have no major illegal records in the last three years, the minimum limit is RMB50 million can be established, and must be approved by the China insurance regulatory Commission.
This three is actually very harsh, summed up is to have the strength, to be approved by the CBRC (instance of insurance companies, banks) the national authority, shareholders to have a good style, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, the insured is not too much to question the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are three thresholds, not what the insurance company can reach.
At this point, it's good and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many of the company's star serious illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest shelves and Tai Super Mary5 serious illness insurance, the claims and insurers are and Tai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not have to question its leaningness.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because there is less operating expenses of the outlets, and the cost of business staff wages, so the Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, support monthly payment, reduce the pressure on the payment of policyholders, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's still very good.
Consider it.
From the salesman professional point of view: this is particularly important, because insurance is a professional requirement is very strong industry, many Internet products customers can be insured themselves, this will exist a lot of misunderstanding, health information and occupation this piece, non-insurance practitioners often in the insurance will add their own subjective consciousness, feel that their health or meet, so it is easy to have a lot of claims hidden dangers, the risk of rejection.
I myself has done insurance telemarketing sales in "Tencent microinsurance and small umbrellas, and it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform) has done insurance telemarketing, which is very responsible to tell you."
Internet insurance is real, also reliable, not reliable people, Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, there are many sales misleading.
For example, :1 yuan insurance insurance six million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 serious illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but the weight is light, will not tell the policyholder, the first month of 1 yuan, the next month is the need to charge according to the normal charge, dozens to 200, many customers deduct fees for a year or two to buy what is not clear.
I thought it could cost a little, and the insurance company would lose six million (the pie fell from the world).
Free mobile phone, is the policy tail number such as 6666,888 this special bill number segment is sent, and if the winning text message is sent, do not exchange, no one is reminded.
(This is a pit for the insured, it is also a pit) free of charge 60,000 serious illness insurance, is short-term, if only this, there is no other commercial insurance, in case there is a serious illness, 60,000 can do, can not solve the problem, the future life began to run naked.
At present, the country is cracking down on the misleading sales of Internet insurance.
So from a comprehensive point of view, the platform is no problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professional professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are better than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwrite offline products, and save each person's savings 2000-3000 yuan / year.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to communicate with me.
I: Mingya insurance broker, has 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, services more than a thousand enterprise users, cooperation of more than 100 insurance companies, before the insurance, I will start from customer needs, tailor-made insurance products for customers, insured, for customers to strive for the best results of insurance, after the insurance, for customers to do policy collation, policy hosting, so that customers rest assured.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer helps the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is that after the policyholder clicks on the insurance link, it can independently complete all the insurance business of the insurance process.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all the steps can be completed by the policyholder.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have too "ceremonial sense", there may not even be a printed version of the paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model, somewhat similar to "phone sales" in general assembly line operations, but there will also be a fatal problem in buying insurance, and that is that the subsequent services of the will of the will probably not keep up.
Insurance is usually a decades-long contract, and when we buy insurance, should we think hard about this "intermediary" we choose, is this "intermediary" that we choose, is it an "insured intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and will also provide us for many years?

Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of smears and invective, and I can't accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can accommodate everything, but we must put an end to this villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style of work that must be resisted first.
From starting with your Facebook plus friend requests to start, then you're making fun-taunted posts, to trying to post what's called my home location and my father's name on social media, I've all taken an attitude of no response.
You have never continued to post, but also continue to post me at the frequency of six meals a day, but also continue to discuss with some obscure and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook, such appearance, body, good health, what kind of bed to grow strawberries, whether to interpolate and so on.
How do I get a lot of comments from a friend about your Facebook friend ’ s account of uploading a photo of you and sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent anymore.
After the news of my alarm, you did not converge at all, but more arrogant.
I ignore what political background you are, and no matter what status you are in our society, it requires gender respect.
Yes, you can continue this kind of taunting, cryptic, humiliating, abusive speech, you can continue to say that you just care and pay attention to me, you can continue to think that it is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your own image or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor know you, and my looks and figure doesn't need you to be bullish.
I don ’ t even think there ’ s any girl who ’ s willing to let someone so humiliate themselves in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, okay?
I said well, and you won't believe it.
I don ’ t think any girl who can be so bullied after he can say that he ’ s okay.
Whether in work, society, politics, or business, only those who don't have basic virtues will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I ’ ve cut some messages to everyone for evaluation.
Your own post should no one impersonate you.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
Will have a smile.

U.S. three-carriers mass-tensive Chinese weapons around China's rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 multi-dimensional pro-China media coverage: The latest news of China-U.S. relations: The latest satellite image shows that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; the US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy arsenal rarely visits Guam, sending important signals to U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" news, on November 9th, the satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Bala Buck Strait.
The Strait of Barabah connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain of the western Pacific Ocean.
The platform expects the "Carl Vinson" to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time the USS Carl Vinson has carried F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft for deployment.
The U.S. aircraft carrier, which is now cruising upstream in the Pacific Ocean, is the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier that departed from the US on November 3.
The "Link" also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan, docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the cruiser "Shangplan Lake" and the USS Stotdar guided-missile destroyer.
The U.S. three-armed aircraft carrier rallied with the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam on November 17, 2022, and the "Strategic Situational Awareness Platform in the South China Sea" released the latest satellite images showing that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are massing around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) The three U.S. and three aircraft carriers gathered the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam on November 17, 2022, and the US warship transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) Separately, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal of weapons was briefly visited Guam last weekend, according to CNN reported on January 17th.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine, which carries two hundred Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, the USS S Nevada, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (15th).
Analysis of the rare visit to Guam by a U.S. and three carriers' massive weapons around China said it was a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first U.S. ballistic missile submarine to visit Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The U.S. three-armed aircraft carrier has a rare visit to Guam, China has built a large number of military installations in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
Pictured is China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine, the USS Nevada, the visit to Guam, strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as the "Lighting submarine" Boomer submarine.
The whereabouts of the 14 Thundering Submarines in the U.S. Navy's fleet are usually strictly secreted.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the Thundering Submarine a "the most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity," a system that also includes well-launched ballistic missiles based on the U.S. mainland, and bombers that can carry nuclear warheads, like B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about Meta ’ s recent tumble of 26% and evaporating $25.1 billion, Zuckerberg responded with “the face of unprecedented competition ” for what?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is an advertising company, revenue mainly comes from advertising, today to make money advertising company, itself has a traffic channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", a lot of App externally to Meta ads, through Meta's advertising platform is to achieve monetization.
But, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get the user's data information again, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user friendly, it will be obvious to suggest whether users allow the app to get their own information, and most people's normal response is certainly not allowed.
If Google stabs another, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's income growth was also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly from the company that China makes its maritime business.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about a few hundred people, and there are several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is around the advertising channels, burning mostly to Meta.
Interestingly, now that the TT of Byte is one of Meta's main competitors, but in the first two years, Meta made a lot of money from the byte.
Various domestic agents are helping byte to Meta to advertise, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven ’ t been special to know lately, but certainly not better than before.
The stage of large-scale burning of Chinese companies abroad has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a slump in revenue, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at middle income, but more importantly, it depends on what is expected in the future.
It's clear Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough in the past two or three years to support the market value of Meta.
So the next two years should be a more difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's very beautiful scenery now, there are also a billion to $200bn of revenue every year, in fact, Facebook is now very crisis feeling very strong, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good and safe moat.
Although several of his social software are now relatively high-live, but also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, but in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also has little confidence, subversive is the blink of an eye.
And the metaverse this unattainable concept, in a short period of time there is no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is the name of the company, but also the reason for the new track is constantly looking for a new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, is a way not to return to the above is my thinking, for reference.
