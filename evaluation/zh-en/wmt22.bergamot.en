Zhejiang University academic annual meeting students play the protagonist of the research results let people open up - Xinhua
Using the air to wash hands, hagulls to judge diseases, and accurately search for sources of smog Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these results are students, research covers the environment, machinery, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities education and other fields, students start from a curious idea, create a number of high-end inventions with application value, some of which have been awarded in the domestic and international.
Biosensors: Your Family Medical Examiner
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor on the spot, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to breathe a light, this set of instruments can be from the gas composition you exhale, preliminary detection of physical health."
Zhang Diming said that the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
The biosensor uses graphene as a new material, its target is chemical elements, keen "smell" allows it to more depth and accurately reflect the health of the body.
Smart Surgical Lamps: Doctors' High-Powered Eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won the silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, masters of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgery shadowless lamps.
"Many diseases are detected early and removed, which is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
For example, when the cancer is checked early, doctors can not see all tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which enhance the difference between different tissues in light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, light degree, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the light spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical School and Zhejiang University Medical School Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: saving water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rubbing soap, squeezing hand sanitizer, and Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air handwashing devices".
As long as we stand on the handwashing station, our weight can compress the air out.
“It’s like a choke.
The compressed air forms fluid at the faucet and the water together.
That way, we can wash our hands!"
Color rendering reactions and bacterial residue experiments have proved that the effect of hand washing through this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving, both to ensure the degree of washing, but also to save 90% of the water, the whole process is completely free of energy consumption, energy saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, the invention was the only gold award among the world’s top universities.

A Certificate of Element – First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I find important in addition to my driver’s license!
Popularization: First-aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time in the process of ambulance coming after the accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.
This is when you need first aid.
If I really had a heart attack, a cerebral hemorrhage, a respiratory arrest, then the window of our lives was only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
People around me know how important it is to be first aid!
When someone falls around us, we can save him through professional knowledge, instead of standing there stupidly and can't do anything, this feeling of helplessness is terrible.
“In China, our official figures are three million people who die unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous being cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
At casino hotels in Las Vegas, seventy-eight percent can be saved, and Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1 percent.”
This is what the founder of the first reaction Lu Le said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, breathing is gone, and the heartbeat is gone, there is no effect in you.
It is necessary to do artificial breathing and chest compressions to save people.
I found that very few people still have this awareness to learn first aid, but when it happens, it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time to face emergencies.
It could save a person’s life!
First aid can be registered in your local Red Cross training center, I am registered at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai, students have preferential treatment.
PS: The last picture is to record the goal to be completed before the age of 25, and it was a few months ago to add the first aid certificate to the target list, but it was indeed completed!
Then to test other want to test the certificate, intend to go to the diving certificate, before the small red book to see there is a diving first aid certificate, the test certificate seems to have a first aid certificate to go to the test, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
That's one of the $13 dumplings!
Never tried.
How does #NAME# not understand?
One for $13?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed the meal, this time a shrimp dumpling for me to eat!
Because obviously I saw it was valid when I typed the code.
First of all, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a full-scale rotten film, in every sense.
But you have to say that this movie is not a highlight, and that is not at least the soundtrack is very good.
There are many kinds of rotten pieces, so that you can fall asleep in the cinema, let you see the indignation is also a kind of, "Four Seas" for the audience is like a monkey on Emei Mountain, it can use countless ways to ignite your anger.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it is like a creature in a Ke family novel, which is indescribable and has many loopholes like a windbreaker on a small horse.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it, you will find that it is actually a piece of shit.
Let me tell you a few things that are difficult for me to understand.
The male residence should be on a small island in the south, and his grandmother is dependent on each other.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then arranged for a gentleman in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a small van.
Old people in vans from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father were very worried about this.
Then the old man did not come down.
How to get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the island's flying car party bastard easily and easily close a section of the mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars in the middle of the road was parked on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This tool is also very obvious.
Why would a mixed-flying party with a bad faith and suspicion become an auxiliary police?
In the face of usury why not call the police, the police in the film also asked whether there is any difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arrange not to find a hotel owner and sit outside the room for a night?
This inexplicable plot is plentiful throughout the film, and because the plot is so outrageous that I feel pain when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is even worse is the main theme of the film, or that the film has no main theme at all, it is a hateful stitching.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guessed that it may be an inspirational film, look at half of it, you think it may be a drama that is not easy to reflect the survival of young people in small towns, after watching it, you do not know what you have seen, followed by a deep suspicion of yourself, why you should go to the cinema to enjoy the stool.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routine of various types of movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle player, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie is becoming successful step by step.
If you want to make a love movie, then you can honestly say that you like to ride motorcycles between the town youth and the waiter's sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot can’t be in the way of something that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle played by Yin Zheng had just been burned, and then the role of singing), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't stand to see.
As for the fact that the woman is obviously not mentally retarded and can perform like a 5-year-old child in some aspects, I really do not know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
I also don't understand why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash plots in his own films?
Is this kind of film arranged in the Spring Festival file, is it to add block to the audience?

South African doctor: Omikron has strong transmission, but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omikron variant of the new coronavirus is more mild than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omikron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, reported that the new crown patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as physical pain and coughs, similar to influenza.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the group’s director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized.
"They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
This includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who would have been more vulnerable to severe disease due to coronavirus infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, the new crown patient he treated in the last wave of Delta’s outbreak was “difficult to breathe and has low blood oxygen levels.”
Many people are going to be hospitalized in a few days.”
Other doctors shared similar experiences within two weeks of the first report of the Omikron variant in southern Africa.
While it will be weeks before enough data is gathered, doctors’ observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks are serious, half of the severe disease in the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent new crown patients have died, while in the early outbreak in South Africa, the proportion of deaths has reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute for Health Research, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health.
"It's still early, we need to get late data.
Usually, hospitalizations and deaths occur late, and we only get into this wave of the epidemic for two weeks."
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are looking at the number of cases and hospitalizations while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world’s leading new coronavirus strain, Omikron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, including South Africa, the epicenter of the outbreak.
Gauteng province saw a 400% increase in new cases in the first week of December, according to health officials, with tests showing more than 90 percent of cases of the Omikron variant.
Thank you to today's supporters, 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Review: What Does It Mean to Save a Kidnapped Child?
If the analogy is "no trade and no killing" of the famous public service slogan, then, in the absence of "abduction" demand in a good environment, group prevention and group governance, the whole people against trafficking, so that the act of trafficking is unprofitable, the risk is high, the cost is high, this kind of crime will not happen repeatedly.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched the emergency release platform for the development of child disappearances.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on the disappearance of children and the timely recovery of abducted children.
Hearing this app is called "reunion", and it feels warm.
New technology means not only the name "literary and art", full of feelings, and information use properly, practical, effective.
The primary goal of the abduction law enforcement is to recover the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be cited a lot of "big words".
However, before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Under the urgent "seeking and rescue" purposes, such as "whether children should be subject to the death penalty" and other controversial topics, can be put on hold and carefully discussed; but the matter of rescuing abducted children cannot be.
According to the experience of the investigation of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the crime scene as soon as possible after winning.
If the abduction action is delayed for one minute, the child may be farther away from the parents, and the difficulty of detection of the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed pragmatic to come up with effective methods such as the "reunification" platform that directly help to solve cases and recover children.
After all, "abduction" is a big task that needs to be done by running the entire legal system.
To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary and the carefulness of law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "child protection and weak support".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be better, from the family to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at the train station, and the parents fell asleep and woke up to find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have enough self-preservation skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should be at least fairly protective.
Taking a break between the parents or placing the child under safe protection is the least means of preventing the abduction of the child.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking, the purchase of abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often only a link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty can be imposed and property confiscated.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is the maximum penalty, and under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child trafficking is obviously a crime with more severe punishment.
There are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in the concept of raising children, and the legal awareness is weak.
The legal education of this part of the people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, we cannot rely on strict official law enforcement alone.
If the "market" of kidnapping is widespread, the traffickers want to smoke, constantly innovate the means of trafficking, and form a "fighting law" situation with law enforcement, the abduction action is bound to fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness and popularizing legal common sense will also help eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is a fat obtained directly from fresh olive fruit after mechanically pressed, filtered and so on to remove foreign bodies.
Depending on the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin olive oil: The highest level and highest quality olive oil is a natural product.
The taste is excellent, there is a pleasant and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity is not more than 1%.
Fine Virgin: slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, pure taste, aromatic.
Ordinary virgin olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): taste and flavor can be good, the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the refined olive oil of virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or becomes a "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to reconcile the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5% and a transparent pale golden yellow.
Refined olive-Pomace oil: Olive oil extracted from oil by dissolution and refined.
If you have seen the classification of grades, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olives are like grapes made of wine, and olives from different regions and different olive varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
Best places to grow olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and temperature, sunlight, air humidity and precipitation conditions required for oleaginous olive growth.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be grown sporadically in the suitable areas.
Primary production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., similar to their climates are also far away in Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on.
Olives are harvested during the month:
From March to June of each year, the time when the olive tree blooms, the fruit begins to develop and mature from July to October, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the fruit picking season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils found so far.
Democracy Summit Ends, Biden Says Freedom Fire Never Goes Out
The online “Summit for Democracy,” convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by leaders of 110 governments and civil society and the private sector, concluded Friday.
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that the second global "democracy summit" is planned to be held next year.
Taiwan government representative Tang Feng, a government member and member of the government, and Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said, "We know how hard the work ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
The autocratic regime will never extinguish the light of freedom, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of society as a whole.
“As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public good,” he said.
The second day of the Democracy Summit will focus on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the same day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially the challenges posed by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, tackling inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a strong condemnation of populism, nativism, and extremism in all its forms, including the use of all the tools offered by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong spoke to the summit in a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to keep an eye on the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For too long, the world has embraced China's rise without creating a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use all that we have to ensure that the restoration of democracy is our top priority.”
Luo also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
"Maybe some of you are afraid of annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat to our democratic values," he said.
And that’s why we failed.
That’s why we have to change.”
Tang Feng, a member of the Taiwan Executive Yuan's political trophy, released the National Statement via video during a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming the Values of Democracy", emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in fighting the new coronavirus epidemic through transparency of information and building mutual trust.
"As Taiwan's democracy is on the rise, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to close the city to control the epidemic, do not have to take off the shelf can defeat the fake information."
At the same time as the second day of the Democracy Summit, the US Treasury Department announced that it imposed sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities found to have committed serious violations of human rights in China, North Korea, and other countries, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to use surveillance technology to help violate human rights.
I took a picture and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn’t know why it’s constantly delaying delivery times.
I want #NUMBER#
I didn't call anyway.
Not eating.
I will certainly complain.
If you can't send it, why don't you talk earlier?
Wait for you so long.
No, I didn't get a call.

A meal for an hour and a half.
#PRS_ORG# was not sent
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel?
The chickens from the restaurant are raw.
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can not distinguish, then the normal situation will be more friendly than cheap beats, this kind of "entry shot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low in strength, the ball hits the top of the pat, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can not withstand, the master is difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so difficult, know that you can't learn, and you know that you don't want to buy expensive, make a cheap thing to fool you, you play twice, you will not play again, so this beat is cheap, you are not distressed.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have progressed, and then come to me to buy expensive, I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince, or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can not sell the price, the new shot 500, 600 is very good, second-hand 200, with a thousand yuan to enjoy the enjoyment?
It is very friendly to the novice, but once the novice stage has passed the chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, can't get through the novice stage.
Orders have been delayed several times
Could you please help me follow up?
Postponement

The girl as a target for her sister to raise money: "Thinking of skin wounds is also good" - Xinhua.com
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large board with the words "human target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a "Hangzhou girl Gantang 'arrow target' for sister to raise money" photo burst the circle of friends.
The photo shows that a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square is standing in front of a large wooden board slightly higher than a person, and the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" are written on the board, indicating that passers-by can use bow and arrow shooting after payment.
This behavior has caused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity of the lower city branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an excessive move for her sister to raise funds, but this behavior is not worth promoting, after warning, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls' street "spear target" fundraising was warned
In the online picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board with a black ink written on the words "human target, ten yuan an arrow", and she wrote her bank account and WeChat account and Alipay account on the other board in front of her.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this is a "eyeball begging behavior", and many netizens sympathize with this.
"We were patrolling around 10 a.m. on the 23rd to the square when we found the situation, when the onlookers have been a lot."
The police of Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said in an interview with local media that there were two girls at the stall, both about 20 years old, dressed up in youthful beauty.
Among them, the girl who is a "human meat target" has been crying and asking passers-by to play this game; another girl helps to drink on the edge, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia, and now she urgently needs surgery.

Last night, the person in charge of the publicity department of the lower city branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News that the girl's name was Ji Jiali, who raised donations for her sister, Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still requires more than 300,000 costs, it is impossible to think of a good way to raise funds before making this behavior.
He said that in the whole process, two girls were a target, one was responsible for playing the hand, but did not participate in it, and no one was found to shoot arrows in the whole process, but someone onlookers and took photos and sent them to Weibo.
After the police were identified by the security department, the bow and arrow used were not subject to control.
The person in charge said, "do not advocate the adoption of this eyeball fund-raising method."
After being warned by the police, she left the police station.

What is the hottest thing in 2021?
The Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Some time ago, there was a "project manager can impact the gold medal of the Olympic project" article is very hot, it mentioned that the project manager in many projects, absolutely can be a horse, no one can be: moving bricks, travel, stay up late is the daily life of the project manager, fire fighting, back pot, apology is not the case.
An article that seems to be a joke and ridicule, but it also shows the daily bitterness of the project managers, which represents the power of the current project management work.
People who are engaged in project management work have gradually chosen to get themselves out of the difficulties of their work through some actions.
Judging from the annual increase in the number of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professional Qualifications) applicants, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management capabilities.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified was about 420,000, and the number of valid licensees was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP licensees has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is not advisable to simply copy the past "old experience" to do things, and the rapidly changing working environment allows us to know that we have to learn and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can PMP ensure that the project management work is unimpeded?
Many project management beginners say that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the top ten areas of project management and the five major process groups and other related knowledge points, but the real project management work is still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management awareness is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, work can not land, project estimation is not accurate, the control sensitivity is poor, the project is delayed; the division of labor of members is not clear, the team in the "old oil" do not know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to promote ...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R & D talents, and won the honorary title of "Chinese enterprise R & D management personnel training demonstration base" and other honorary titles of Zhongtianhua Xian with the "R & D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course.
"R & D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course This is an online fragmented learning method, combining many R & D enterprises to combat cases, tools and methods, to help you master the project manager's necessary knowledge and standard actions, on the advanced road of their own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient results to the enterprise.
Without proof, you can first see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (the original Huawei R & D management team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and many well-known enterprises real business scenarios, the course content of the in-depth professional explanation.
It will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students apply the content of their learning to specific work after class.

The level of financial literacy of the elderly and young people is relatively low, "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen released the "China's young people's debt situation report" and CCTV financial released "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" shows that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of the people do not have debt accumulation, although the younger generation as a whole presents a rational consumption trend, although the outside world.Social problems have gradually increased, and financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jiexin has always been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and intimate services, advocating that consumers establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively respond to regulatory calls to enhance consumers, especially young people, rational consumption awareness with practical actions.
In the past few years, Jiexin has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for youth groups, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young groups through various forms such as cooperation with top domestic universities to rationally guide the consumption demand of young people, help them establish a rational consumption concept, rationally plan consumption demand, and thus help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of the arrival of the two sessions, Jiexin reminded all consumer friends to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, we must plan in advance and repay on time.
If overdue, overdue records will be recorded in personal credit reports, which may have an adverse impact on economic life such as buying a car and buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should also be selected, and attention should be paid to checking whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, as always, with its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated iterative financial products, it will bring consumers more appropriate to their needs and diversified services, continuously help the public improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a reliable consumer financial partner for life.

Notably, it was the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward “unity and stability” mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of a new ambassador between the two countries in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar out of demands that they must unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, in order to address common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi crown prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land passage between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long passage connecting the two countries will facilitate travel and the integration of the supply chain for citizens of the two countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement the Gulf Arab states have condemned for not resolving the issue of missiles with Iran.
Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a long-term “competitor” and a “threat” to regional security.
Gulf states see no solution to the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iran’s activities in the region as flawed.
In the context of the failure of the major powers to meet the wishes of the Gulf states in the nuclear negotiations between the major powers and Iran, Saudi Arabia has conducted direct negotiations with Iran.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic gains that have contributed to the restoration of the GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

It is said that the new mountain super-running exhaust sound is the largest!
This car that our team has brought to everyone is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the Malaysian dollar is nearly two million, the one-year road tax is ten thousand, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
That is not known, the data said 0-100km/h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, probably the small series of myvi to 30km / h when people go to 100km/h, um.
The low body, the hustle and bustle door, the huge air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine with the glass, perfectly interpret the Lamborghini style.
For the car description do not need to say too much, their own Google a good, small series sorted out some Google does not necessarily give the explanation!
It's too much attention, where everyone is watching, it's very uncomfortable! (actually a little cool)
1km oil money around RM1 (car owner does not care at all)
Get off the car posture to practice, otherwise it will be a little awkward (because you can't climb the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and you will be deaf when you get off the car. (but still cool)
The body is too large, and the parking space will be very narrow, I am afraid of being knocked when the next car opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (small series himself said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, please contact us!
More information about cars you don't know, right here in The Car Guide / People's Car
A car accident worth a million dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that the Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the Porsche 911 price is also in the millions!
Just a few days ago, a foreign country hit a million sports cars 911 and tens of millions of super-running Chiron!
Look at the results, the price makes sense!
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with the same frequency - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school concepts and value pursuits that have been accumulated for a long time in the process of development, and is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of the university has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations, for China's universities, the rise in the autumn of national distress, its spirit is deeply affected by the traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the "Mingdejishi, repairing the rule of the same" value concept and "learning the strong country" patriotic responsibility.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, the global education competition, science and technology competition, and talent competition are intensifying, and the cause of higher education is an important "supply side", and its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" put forward, while demonstrating China's confidence and determination to move from a big country of higher education to a strong country in higher education, it also puts forward higher requirements for university development.
How to strive to become one of the world's first-class ranks in a relatively short period of time, on the basis of still a certain gap to speed up the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, to achieve "curve overtaking"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, after the latecommand advantage, by continuing to introduce outstanding overseas academic talents, learning to learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and quality of running a school; second, cultural advantages, inherit the wisdom of Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, carry forward the development of excellent traditional culture, in order to unite the country, shape the brand, enhance the image; third, give full advantage to the system advantages of the socialist country.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that the construction of a world-class university cannot be a thousand schools, and each school must show its personality and characteristics while giving play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running the school must have both common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to the characteristics of three aspects in running the school: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurship training, build an integrated education environment for the integration of science and education and the integration of schools and enterprises, and form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, we highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary integration, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create a cross-disciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate cross-cutting interdisciplinary disciplines and landmark cross-cutting achievements; third, highlight the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchange and cooperation.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the "pursuit of innovation" school motto, "hard work, moral, discernment, solid" common values and "Hina River, Qi Zhenhoude, open up the people, tree and state" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, and constantly accumulate cultural height and cohesion of spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the mind of "the world's talents for my use", and shows the high-quality concept of drawing on the world's famous schools to educate people; "Enlightenment" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which refers to the university's pursuit of truth at the same time, but also to accept the virtue of the cultivation and personality; "opening the people" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, including the innovation of knowledge, and the innovation of scientific research.Dedication, is that the university should always be with the fate of the nation and the same pride and humiliation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"The wise hear in silence, and the wise see in the unshakeable."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission entrusted to the higher education cause, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times and the national spirit of each other, so as to provide inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national revitalization and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

At the time of the NFT’s rapid rise, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income in the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-forming game based on blockchain technology, a collection of NFT and other ways to play, is currently the highest transaction volume of NFT projects, has more than 3 billion U.S. dollars.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity earns more than $ 8.2 million a day, directly to the glory of the king.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that it had more than 1 million daily active users.
"Axie Infinity" is hot will be a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, in addition to the fun and economic benefits from the game, but also to participate in the governance of the game ecology.

Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises in the track, that is, the choice of investment target industry, first of all to choose the growth space of the industry, at least 100 billion market size; secondly, to choose the future growth of the industry, consider the next 3-5 years after the industry to achieve the best state of the industry; finally, to choose the industry with policy support.
How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Take the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 tactical layout.
The “do the things right” means to do the right thing.
The strategy is “do the right thing.”
Strategy is to find direction, tactics lie in landing, on top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether it is to continue to deepen in the current field or horizontal (strategic thinking); for example, on the basis of improving customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on the improvement of activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right activity KPI to achieve the right activity goals, such as improving the target customer engagement, activate high-value silent customers, and accurately promote the current growth.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin has ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated Bitcoin as legal tender, which is the first time that Bitcoin has become a national or regional legal tender.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a Bitcoin ETF and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF landing in the US capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin carried out a soft fork upgrade called “Taproot” that increased the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduced the data burden on transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in enrollment at 3 major Ivy League schools, including Yale
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and Justice on the 23rd to protest against three Ivy League schools, Yale University and Dartmouth College, discriminating against Asian-American applicants during the admissions process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukhang, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of famous American schools has increased exponentially, but the proportion of Asians in these three elite schools in the United States has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "long-term persistent and systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admissions process.
Zhao said that in 2014, research by Sanders and other scholars showed that in these three colleges and universities, Asians had the lowest acceptance rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that of all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students, and Yale and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and Justice to investigate after the complaint is filed and take steps to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after finding the facts.
They also expect the colleges and universities that have been complained of to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admissions policies for Asians.
At present, the three universities that have been the complaint have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015 when it complained about discrimination in admissions at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups, the complaint also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing agent that a factory in Yuyao Bing Town, Zhejiang Province, had seen the house on the spot, and after seeing the house on the spot, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the plant.
In December of the same year, after consulting with Lin, the family of the owner of the house, Mr. Lu, on the details of the purchase of the plant, sent 200,000 yuan through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin in the "plant sale deposit deposit" as the recipient's signature, which stated, "if the buyer does not want to buy this plant, the deposit belongs to the seller, if the seller is not willing to sell this plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, the two sides agreed to sign a plant sales contract within a week."
However, after that, the two sides failed to form an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the contract for the sale of houses.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
Hard to see the house, the deposit paid, the house is also ready, it is close to "a foot" to sign the contract, the seller did not sell, which makes Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the two sides finally failed to sign a formal contract, could not only be attributed to the defendant, and should be reasonably presumed to be that the deposit penalty was not successful, so the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant did not have to bear the liability for double the refund of the deposit.
After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the verdict.
[Lawyer Reminder] We must exercise the necessary due diligence obligations in the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer should exercise the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and the specific time and place of delivery are specified in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
After the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "leaders' democracy summit" to "draw the line of ideas, weaponize and weaponize democracy, and act against democracy in the name of democracy, incite division and confrontation, and deflect domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', abused unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', with disastrous consequences.
"Democracy" has long been a "weapon of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden’s move to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held by video, with the participation of leaders from 111 countries around the world, including those from Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have also been questions at the international level and in the United States, such as critics of the leaders invited to the meeting, including leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some people doubted that the Biden administration's real intention was not to organize the summit for democratic but geopolitical purposes.
German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit.
"Today's American democracy is sick, and the issues of money politics, identity politics, party antagonism, political polarization, social tearing, racial contradictions, and the division of the rich and the poor are intensifying," the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday. "The U.S. democracy is a "game of the rich" based on capital.
"As leaders of our government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent accountability, to be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of autocracy, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public good," Biden said.
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. "We must constantly update it in every generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time," he said.
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need to be defended by champions in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The United States has pledged to pursue a one-year campaign following the Democracy Summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments ahead of the Entity Democracy Summit scheduled for the end of 2022 to improve their democratic institutions.
"Let all of us live up to our commitments and report on the progress we've made next year," Biden said.
I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.

Taste of Meat Good Service
Long time did not come to the sun, fruit fishing is still so good to drink & real material, the first time to order the burning bag, is my love soft flour southern taste!
Cooking rice is dry and wet to the extent, the weight is very sufficient, the signature tin paper chicken wings as always praise, the soup is also good, mustard and Lan is also relatively good.
Taste of the service Enthusiastic Meat good
Many years ago, it was also the existence of net red, Dongshang small building, wooden floor.
The door always has to wait a long time to eat the rice, the casserole of the rice is cracked.
For several years, I did not eat the sun, and the rise of Cantonese cuisine in various small stores scattered the passenger flow.
It is rare to see the store there are seats, the quality of the dishes is not said, as always good.
Good taste of meat, good food.
The day-to-day sale.
Meals: This meal was a little bit disappointing.
Three cups of chicken: a little more with the side dishes, a little less chicken.
The main tone of this taste is a little biased, the bottom taste of salty is not enough, it highlights the sweetness, we can make up for the sweet + various spices and dishes.
What is a red whiskey?
Everyone's hobbies are different, some people like collecting, some people like food, of course, some people like to taste wine, red whiskey is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and red whiskey has won the International Wine Competition Gold Award.
Every bottle of red-branded whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don’t know how to taste it, it doesn’t ruin its mellow flavor.
How to drink red whiskey?
The small series is a brief introduction for everyone.
Drink of red whiskey:
The red-branded whisky is made from around 35 Scotch whiskies, which are rich in aromatic and traditional Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma.
The inlet is fresh, slightly vanilla and thick smoky malt flavor.
The wine can be added to ice or mixed with a favorite drink.
Red-branded whiskey enters the country, and in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, bubble drinks such as red whiskey + cola or Sprite or novelty have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing and sour, can visually bring people pleasure, add drinks, and play a role in dipping the taste of the wine to change the taste.
Red-plated whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar (sand sugar can also be), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic red Fangwei tastes somewhat sour, adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, lemon will bring fresh aroma to the wine, of course, sweet acid can be adjusted according to personal tastes.
The above three are the best way to drink red whiskey, we can use as a reference to try, I hope the introduction of the small series can help you.
Education thinking: how to make the "student hegemony" and "scum" get their own place in the university examination
Lanzhou Jiaotong University 3 students to the school leadership letter, reflecting the confusion of the university exam, and put forward to improve the difficulty of the exam, change the test question type, so that the exam truly reflects the actual level of students' demands.
Indeed, for a long time, college exams have been a "hot topic".
On the university campus, students come from all over the world, and the level of ability is different, coupled with the different levels of learning, and the learning situation is very different.
For groups with such multiple characteristics to assess, there are different feelings, it is inevitable.
Of course, if the test question type is single and the repetition rate is high, the question is too simple, which will inevitably cause another very different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may pass the pre-examination concentrated assault, if you think of other methods, it may achieve a multiplier effect.
In this way, there are "scumbs" usually do not invest can pass, and even get a high score; "student" usually never drop off class, homework, notes are as good as, the exam is not much higher "strange status quo".
In this way, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that the problems in the university examination are not without reason, and I believe that this situation is not only Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these three students who wrote directly to the letter.
In fact, people who have been to the university are clear, and it is not uncommon to rush to prepare for the exam, think of various ways to "take" the test question from the teacher, strive to draw the scope of the exam, and get the "key tutoring" before the exam, and even in the exam with a small copy, the test asked the teacher to raise your hand.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment guide, measuring the pass of a university examination depends on the teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and scientific propositions on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate level of the university, the major begins to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content to be examined by the university examination.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline, from the point of knowledge, the space for change is not large, basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "20 years ago, the basic knowledge of mathematics in college, is still learning, or the focus."
However, the knowledge point is basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test question type is single and the test question is repeated.
In many universities, the exam will generally form a question group, and then by the senior teachers of the discipline to form a test paper, the examination paper is also by the whole teacher to participate in the subject, so that you can overcome the duplication of the test to a certain extent.
However, in order to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning, the topic is difficult to be normalized according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test proposition has a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and the problem type, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge investigation, but also take into account the ability to examine, and at the same time, the problem type is innovatively designed.
The exam is the baton of university education, what kind of exam, students will have the corresponding test preparation program, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the letter of recommendation of students, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed rectification programs throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out self-examination of seminars and course completion examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and audit links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of single type of test, the problem of repeated problems is the problem that universities need to face, of course, it needs to introduce the corresponding system, but kung fu is expensive in daily life, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student's learning situation, the two ends will be better docking, forming a benign interaction, and the exam will be more in line with reality.

The photographer is also very humorous, and it is very happy to take pictures all day.
When choosing photos, because you see a lot of cases on the Internet, do not want to let guests delete too many photos, but when we choose photos, really, there is no meaning of us to add photos, 24 directly in the package, one of which is not added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at about the same time, more than 7,000 packages also added more than 10,000 photos, when I was shocked, I was also afraid that I would choose too much)
Today the photo was repaired, Lanlan sent me, I saw two of them feel not very good, they immediately helped me to repair.
I think my sister's previous photos are compared, I think our photos I am really satisfied, simple and fresh, is the style I want.
I really recommend that you go to Mrs. Hanjin to take wedding photos!
Price: $3,999

At the press conference, he explained the report of an online media that the problem of printing paper in Sabah was for 10 months.
He said the problem had been there two months earlier and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is the production of special anti-counterfeiting paper Chinese manufacturers affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed arrival in our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah newspaper paper is different from that of other regions, so it is not possible to borrow inventory from other states.
Kairu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed over to the printing company on the 8th to carry out part of the printing work.
"The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing, it is estimated that more than 2 working days (December 20) can be handed over to the applicant."

48 hours of negative nucleic acid, set up a "buffer zone" State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document to strengthen the port city epidemic prevention and control
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporter Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring people who have recently left the land border port city (except for those connected to the port of Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative proof of nucleic acid detection within 48 hours, and to conduct at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date of determining the scope of port cities in various provinces and cities and announcing them until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health and Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and border people on both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of the policy of zoning differentiation management, from a prevention and control spillage defense line into two lines of defense, is expected to achieve the threshold forward, reduce the risk of spillover of the epidemic, with the minimum social impact, the lowest social cost to achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster epidemics in China, all of which are imported from overseas cities through port cities.
The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this has exposed some local epidemic monitoring and early warning in a timely manner, closed-loop management of high-risk post personnel, regular nucleic acid detection in form, insufficient killing of cold chain items, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that from nine aspects such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, accelerate the completion of the shortcomings and weaknesses of port city prevention and control, do a good job in prevention and control without relaxation and science, and weave a tight external defense input defense line.
The notice stressed that all port cities should synchronize research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work, announce and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly investigate the hidden dangers of basic living materials supply and price, and solve and take the initiative to respond to outstanding problems reflected by the masses in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the port cities mentioned therein include open land, water routes, and air ports where the county (city, district, flag), the city (territories, states, alliances) and the municipality directly under the Central Government, the specific scope of which is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and timely announcement.

The truth about the bloodthirsty killing of the US military for 20 years from the bottom of the pipeline video - Xinhua
(Video source: oil)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the pipeline platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launched the war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism", forcibly exported American democracy through war, and committed various crimes against humanity for 20 years.
The misuse of drones to air strikes on civilian sites such as hospitals and schools, distorts human nature, and sets up killing teams.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has set up a "black jail" to inflict all kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects".
A crime against humanity has sparked more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorism" war "the more anti-Vietnam terror."
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, only devastated countries and countless killings and destruction.
Pricking the video, let us together to expose the truth of the bloodthirsty killing in the name of "counter-terrorism" in the name of the United States, and puncture the hypocritical facade of American democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from the perspective of business and the preservation period, why the customer should help the logistics company in the bonded area to do cans, although the canning belongs to deep processing, does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company, here is the following text may explain why customers want to do this?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the bag and the listening milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
So you will definitely ask: why is the shelf life of the bag one year, and the shelf life of the listening is two years or longer?
Or ask again: why is the price difference between listening and bagging so much?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mother-level, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mentality after eating the reaction that the taste or taste of the hearing is not the same!
Now let me tell you about the reason why it is expensive, where is the price?
Why are the same raw materials so different?
Because most manufacturers in the pricing time are considered that if the bag pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or no profit, what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of listening clothes to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote the hearing, rather than the bag.
And you think so many manufacturers every year advertising costs tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars, where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the marketing costs of the market, such as: the mall's promotion staff, the display costs of the mall, the cost of giving gifts of products, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and listening, and their prices are constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product with the increase in market expenses.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their own products, unscrupulous means, linked to the doctor of the hospital, by them to assist in the promotion of products, from a listen to the profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such a method of operation, in fact, this practice is to harm consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy bagged milk powder in the home under the premise of the can, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no effect on children.
And everyone should not think that the shelf life of the listening is longer than the bag, if the warranty after the bag is the same as the shelf life of the bag, it is not easy to save after the bag is opened, and it is easy to be spoiled by moisture.
The food is late, the food is cold, and then dry and hard, there is no way to eat it.
The soup was also spilled.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua Net
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful learning books.
Many of today's successful books promote the "best principles"—that is, assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that the "how to do" is actually the most important and fundamental link.
Because of this, these books have a common feature - either you do the best, or you just do nothing; you are 100, or 0; you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay in place.
This "best principle", let anyone see will admit "correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated in front of the starting line.
Because this theory preaches a path of "you have to make up your mind, to be a human being again, to a 180-degree change", which is the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who follow the rules, follow the rules, and refuse to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly a self-deception and a bull.
The vast majority of people will be in front of the word "transformation" timid, trapped, difficult to make a decision; or with a momentary impulse pain "change" determination, and bravely took the first step, but often not long, can not stick to a long time to lose the battle, difficult to see the continuity.
The sound of Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "Starting Tomorrow" is the most eloquent expression of this "universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, and makes the vast majority of people "look forward to sighing".
Perhaps the "principle of good" is a way to put more ordinary people on the road to relative success.
The core of the "next good principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a "small victory is a big win" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only go up to the small sand dunes on your doorstep, because it is always stronger than the place.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, it is more likely to make ordinary people insist, and as long as everything is adhered to, the probability of success will increase.
It is only a path to success that follows the "sub-good principle", and its journey is slightly longer.
All in all, the "best principle", although on the surface to make everyone succeed, but it can eventually inspire, in fact, is still a minority; and "the principle of the next good", in order to effectively motivate more people, as much as possible to benefit more people.
Do I need to re-order now?

How to contact?
Please cancel your order.
I can't wait any longer, thanks.

Qinghai Lake bare carp resources this year increased by 0.71 million tons - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the amount of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the early stage of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp colloquial name "trout", is a unique precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, and plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the ecological chain of "water-fish-bird" in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as the increasing degradation of the environment in the artificial mass killing and the breeding of naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake in 2002 was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp of Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has banned the cultivation of fish in lakes, prohibiting any unit, group and individual from fishing naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release and clean up the main rivers and rivers of Qinghai Lake, and the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures to continue to increase protection, the amount of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that as of now, the naked carp of Qinghai Lake has implemented artificial breeding and release of nearly 180 million tails, and the contribution rate to the recovery of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 23%.
The Sanjiangyuan area of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this year, Qinghai has successively issued a notice on the prohibition of fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and has built a comprehensive no-take management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only brought me a bag, to be packed into the bag, the weather is cold
Do you think it’s in a bag?
We only see one bag.
Want to know if it was missed or if someone took it, thanks
It’s been an hour and it hasn’t arrived yet.
I just saw an article on a regular holiday, which is too long.
Give a little to an unknown male.
Most girls will suddenly go through their first official leave one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea at the age of 50.
After that, you will come to it once a month more regularly under the premise of good health.
But it is not regular enough to accurately predict, about a week or so of tolerance, need to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the bad luck will roll over (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people are three days, some people are one week; some people flow less, some people have a big blood crash; some people have no reaction, some people are sad to the ambulance, the pain will change with time, and the pain does not mean a lifetime.
Menstruation is not controlled, bleeding 24 hours a day until the end, and all you can do is use a sanitary napkin or tampon to prevent blood from flowing to the clothes chair.
Pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins, and eating ibuprofen can effectively relieve the pain of the month when the physiological period has not yet come, and it is useless to eat after the pain begins.
Before the physiological period, due to the full blood of the uterus and the release of too much prostaglandin, it is easy to get sick.
If you are about to the cycle, inexplicably, the stomach will basically come to menstruation in two days.
Sanitary napkins are best replaced once in two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, except for sleep time, the worst case is to replace 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is, 42 tablets, if you add the part prepared in advance may have 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
(Amend it here, the tampons do not need to be changed often, about five or six hours to change once, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormone can be more irritable, ovulation will also be because of the hormone changes in the body mood instability, is very unlucky, the body to make itself tripping.
But official crime data can show that women’s ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they don’t make excuses for emotional problems.
It is not just blood that flows, it contains the shedding of the uterine lining.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly thickened, it can be understood that the uterus is a house, and the house (endeum thickens) every month is ready to welcome guests, the guests did not come, all removed (menstrual discharge) and then build a new house next month, starting over and over again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, a few days a month 24 hours of bleeding, will be abdominal pain and low back pain, who would want?
But people can be born because his mother came to menstruation, menstruation is to prepare you to live in the house for 10 months when you first come to this world, everyone should thank their mother for the regular health of menstruation.
In the past, many things of women were suppressed, and the society brainwashed women and said that it was dirty and shameful, and everyone thought that it was so, but the times had changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the preparation behavior of women's bodies for the birth of life is disgusting, should not be said in public, girls stand up, don't think about it anymore, never experience it, don't experience it in this life, and don't know much about men, don't be so ungrateful, how can this attitude mean to face their mothers, how to want their children?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons, it is really good.
Today is the winter solstice festival, and it is disappointing to send the wrong one.
Order another meal for the kids.
I hope the store is busy to check the product.
Is the foot soaking in the foot drain a leak?
Choosing the right foot tub can play a good role in foot therapy and health care, and today's U.S.-based small series will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, the foot bath is more and more loved by consumers, and a large number of different products have emerged in the market, from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health appliances such as foot tubs are hot, but there is no special industry standard for foot tubs, so there are certain safety hazards.
“It’s too dangerous to soak your feet in electricity.”
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath to give his father a birthday gift, but his father soaked his feet and felt the soles of his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought that it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, and did not expect to turn off the vibration function, and the father still felt the soles of the feet.
Mr. Li gave a test of the pen, the pen actually bright, Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath actually was charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, the attitude of the business is not bad, although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this long-popular foot bath is now not a clear and detailed industry regulation in terms of the maximum temperature setting, what kind of people are suitable for, what kind of material to ensure harmless and so on.
However, under normal circumstances, the foot tub will not have a charged problem, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly closed when leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a split-type foot bath when purchasing.
Water and electricity are separated without any safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take the laptop test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Fair - See the headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily News, December 10 (all-media reporter Zhang Shangwu Hu Phanping Correspondent Liu Xiaoling Photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, carrying forward tea culture, and accelerating the goal of sprinting the 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the All-China Supply and Marketing Cooperation Council, and Ye Hong, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: the source of lake red is new, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into the "colorful Xiang tea".
In recent years, the provincial Party committee and the provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Xiang tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Sanxiang Four Waters and Colorful Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main teas such as green tea, black tea, and black tea have taken turns, and the main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea brigades, driving the majority of tea farmers to increase their income.
The feng shui turns, and the black tea is working.
According to experts in the tea industry in the province, after the green tea is harvested, black tea is harvested, and tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens has risen sharply.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the license for the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark of "Hunan Black Tea", and Xinhua praised the "source of lake red".
In the new black tea exhibition hall, Fujian tea merchants look at a kind of alpine tea called "ice spring", and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zheng, secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Association, said happily that factors such as the current epidemic have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea fair, the highlights are numerous.
The new black tea is red, infused with the connotation of tea culture, popularity, trading fire, and the Xiang tea industry welcomes the new spring.
If the food is not hot, can it be cancelled?
I don't want to, because there is no parking below, he can't get there.

That little given, you a male chicken sauce need money
You bring the restaurant.
I just don't want to go downstairs to buy things, so I will spend so much money to sell.
Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my friends for their humanitarian assistance over a long period of more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally issued an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Today, the majority of the victims' old parents have been honored, and the orphans have grown up to work.
It is your actions that have helped our troubled families through the most difficult times.
At present, the new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation to the Tiananmen Mothers, a humanitarian relief campaign that is long overdue for a perfect end.
I will always remember your love and am confident that your deeds will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Let me take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32 years of humanitarian assistance at IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the All-American Self-School Federation and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are parallel two organizations, and the executioners of the project often cross.
(Apple Daily image: Tian'an 門母親網站 is taken care of by 陶業負負責). pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
The rescue money is often not delivered to the June 4th.
In 1994, Mr. Ding suggested that a special group be set up by the "Tiananmen Mother" to coordinate and receive and distribute the rescue funds in charge.
In 1998, MCDF established the June Fourth Orphan Education Fund, and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the orphans graduated from college, MCDF established the "June Fourth Orphaned Elderly Special Life Assistance Fund", which has been implemented to this day.
Funding for these projects, mainly from campus and social donations from June 4th, from personal generous donations, and is supported by the Brothers University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the June 4th victims finally received a donation from Hong Kong in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently implemented their humanitarian aid programs.
We understand that Mr. Ding's suspension of the June 4 donation is for the consideration of donors, we are indeed some retired elderly, the income is not as sufficient as before retirement, and I would like to thank Mr. Ding for his letter of "to friends".
We will respect the decision of the denigrators to terminate the project within two years and to resume it immediately if needed.
We would like to express our gratitude and respect to those who have been generous and brave enough to pay humanitarian aid for many years.

If there is a lack, please contact the customer service in time.
Microfluidic chip cover plate for PC material, do not enter the solvent chemical reaction with the PC.
Do not use a push syringe to directly feed the chip, otherwise it is prone to leakage.
The microfluidic chip of the ordinary substrate passes the pure water test at 500 mbar (100um channel depth) or 300 mbar (50um channel depth) before shipment.
The glass substrate chip passes the pure water test at 800mbar (100um channel) injection pressure before shipment, and you should be careful not to collide with the sharp object during the use of the glass substrate chip, otherwise it will damage the substrate.
During use, please consider the viscosity of the solution and do not exceed this range, otherwise it will cause leakage.
Under the condition that the injection pump uses pure water injection, we give you the recommended flow rate set below 150ul/min, and the oil phase flow rate is recommended to be below 50ul/min.
Please consider the viscosity of the actual incoming liquid, from slow to fast increase your flow rate parameter value.
After the general chip is completed, please clean the internal channel in time, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for a long time.
If the damage caused by the long-term use or improper operation of the chip is not returned.
If you need a microfluidic chip that can withstand greater pressure or flow velocity, you can contact customer service for customization.

How do I pay?
The rest of the meal has arrived.
No riders to accept.
Now the restaurant staff call me.
A programming white who wants to share personal experiences.
If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if there is no idea in this area, it is best to teach yourself well, after all, the training costs a lot of money, but also need 6 months to learn.
But if it is intended to pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have self-control and its weak, training is a very good choice.
If your self-control is relatively strong, you can also choose self-study, but you will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, it is necessary to look at the teaching strength of this institution, if the teacher strength is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong teachers.
Secondly, before choosing to explore this training institution, it is best to explore the students of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how this institution is, and the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer this question, because you have not made a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with the individual's own situation.
For example, a professional, age, the language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will have something to do with the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or have graduated in computer science, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, and now many offline online training institutions are actually very good, but a high learning cost, two investment time is more, the basic need to focus on training 3-6 months.
But if I say these things, self-study is very convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the network are free, or go to B station also has a lot of training resources, if you do not find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction, get free resources, or detailed consultation.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to go to the training institution to learn, so that the learning does not have to be very laborious, the teacher is also very detailed, there are also special answers to the problem, in addition to learning planning or supervision is also helpful.
And now a lot of training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are places to push, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the interview process can save a lot of things.
The above is some of my views, the above said because do not understand your situation, so only probably the introduction is not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can always contact me to communicate.
I said before 1 o'clock, I saw it in the app.

The more you are afraid, the more you will be struck down by difficulties; if you rise to the challenge, the problem will eventually be solved.
China-Saudi curators join hands to host Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale - Xinhua
RIYADH, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale, the Diriere Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriere JAX Art Zone northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places exhibiting.
The Biennale is jointly curated by the Saudi Diliyeh Biennale Foundation and the China UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, and Tian Xiaoyu, director of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, serves as the art director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the Biennale is "crossing the river with stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi society and cultural development.
The Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presenting in six units: "Touching the Stones across the River", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Thinking on the Edge", "Going to the Public", "Brave New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performing arts and other forms of painting; 12 Chinese artists' works also attracted attention, and some artists used recycled materials to create in novel ways, such as Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste in the "Short Story Series of Xishan Endless Map" (2014).
Barkley, CEO of the Dirieux Biennale Foundation, said that he hopes that the Biennale will establish an international dialogue, so that global audiences can have the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industries and creative communities and strengthen interaction.
“The goal of the Biennale is twofold, both to engage Saudi contemporary art in the global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art,” said Tian.
It is understood that during the opening week of the Biennale, a series of lectures will be held, and artists, curators and creative industry opinion leaders will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinated and standardized rural public welfare post management-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in helping people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently issued policies to promote rural revitalization of rural public welfare posts to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
At present, a total of 448,300 rural public welfare jobs have been developed in Yunnan for the employment of rural difficult groups such as the labor force out of poverty, which plays an important role in helping the people out of poverty to achieve employment, consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improving the capacity of rural public services.
The new regulations are jointly issued by seven departments such as Yunnan Human Resources, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, and mainly standardize the scope of targets, fund management, post development, and post management for grass-roots recruitment of rural public welfare posts.
In terms of job development and setting up, the new regulations are clear, in accordance with the principles of "building posts on demand, setting up people, dynamic management, and total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary open, unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, audit, publicity, recruitment, pre-post training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that the rural public welfare post development departments should purchase accident insurance for rural public welfare post placement personnel; the relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the issuance of subsidies for rural public welfare posts.
The address is wrong.
Hello there
Can I cancel the order?
I re-ordered.
Has it been cancelled?
Second, although the right has an era of ambition in history, it is not long, so it is short because it gives a little sunshine to shine, drink a little boiling water and sweats; if you have to look down on it with a little ambition, it will be attached to the blow.
But realistically speaking, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution defining the standard of truth, developing the economy to improve science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and human rights protection.
As far as I am concerned, although I do not agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statement and respect Li Weidong's person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that the counter-necessary revolution, the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, the people's livelihood will be damaged, the political groups will be mixed with the mud, and then the foreign countries will take advantage of it.
Fourth, change or improve China's patience and accountability for the country's people, political speculation is trying to pick up the chestnuts in the fire, it is not the right, it is a bastard.
Talk about the left.
The left is actually a group of eras and political outcasts.
If the right has a positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right-hand words and analyze their thoughts when it needs, then the left will not create it, because the left wants exactly what the Communist Party throws away!
Five, recently saw some friends while pushing the thief side to the left, but also very angry, I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitor and the left, it's all a rib, it's unreasonable.
Don't try to prove us right, let alone try to let the anti-thiopard and left-wing admit, why not?
I told my friends this: When the anti-thieves scold you for five cents, when the left scolds you right dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are teenagers, but when they are old, they forget the ideal, or pursue the ideal, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually drifted away, and even the dragon-killing teenager eventually became a dragon.
I think that in general, it refers to restraint and freedom, and China's innate genes from history and culture lead to China as a whole should be left-wing.
The right-wing freedom at home, with a focus on efficiency and development, the left is more regulatory and more equitable and safe.
Now the society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, the Sino-US dispute is certain, and it is estimated that it will last for many years.
Even if you don't understand it, praise it is over.
I don’t know, flowers are just that.
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei's chips by the US Empire has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused "US" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
The United States suppresses China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and related enterprises in allied countries to simultaneously block China's chip industry, which directly causes the orders and profits of global chip suppliers to be affected, resulting in lower R&D investment and reduced production capacity of chip manufacturers, resulting in a shortage of chip supply chains worldwide.
Now "missing core" has spread to the world's major industries, such as car companies to stop production, mobile phone prices, almost all the industries using chips are deeply affected.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips", more and more national technology giants have begun to move towards the road of "de-glamorization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control, containing the development of China's semiconductor industry, the recent action of the United States frequently, but also presided over the "chip summit"; also invited the 64 giants to set up a semiconductor alliance, and unplug the United States to support the United States local technology giants, for example, the old technology giant Intel in order to regain the dominant position in the chip field, spent 20 billion U.S. dollars in Arizona to build two wafer processing plants, and open to the outside world chip foundry business.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to steal TSMC's "job".
The reason why it is so certain is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant of the United States and the Empire, has been cultivating for decades in the semiconductor field, has a large talent team and technical reserves, and will surely rise rapidly in the short term to defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou is dismissive.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou said amazingly, and for Intel to invest in the fab, Zhang Zhongmou has no scruples: Intel builds a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou is still worried about a period of grievance between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, ranking at the top of the world, and is the hegemon of the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips have been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was completed by a factory from design, manufacturing to sealing and testing, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Under the inspiration of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear division of labor and cooperation phenomenon, in 1984 Zhang Zhongmou heard that there is a company specializing in chip design, it is believed that since there is a special design, then you can set up a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aimed its main business at the single link of "wafer processing", not designed, and only provided foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at the time, was small in front of the big Mac of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had sought Intel investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing process of the chip industry, it was obviously very high, looked down on TSMC, and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer process services at that time.
I did not expect that the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services at that time would now begin to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into the wafer foundry is ironic.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to hold itself.
Today, TSMC has sprinted toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck in 14nm seven years ago.
Trying to catch up is not easy.
Waited.
Ordered in 2 hours until 19:06.
I saw some strange searches today.
What is normal public opinion?
Random selection of three hot search: February two dragons rise, good friends price increases, cargo pull events, public opinion spread to form a wave peak, and then [exponential decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated, if the secondary public opinion will have a small hump reappears.
They look the same as the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" that the website of the Internet Information Office has shown.
What is an unusual opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches in the same event, showing "lone peaks", "scratch", "broken cliffs".
[Scleonic] That is, artificial heating, quickly rushed to the hot search, causing public attention; [saw-tooth] is periodic heating to ensure that the topic is on the hot search list; [the cliff-like] is the collective evacuation, the hot search to play the "function", receive new tasks, rush to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event happens to be another event's trough, the time is not bad, it must be the unified batch of the Marines to receive the task, to start a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot search on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which are responsible for the war, which diverts attention, what influences cognition, what is misleading judgment, which incites emotions, and which block decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and sub-nodes, and almost all elements of public opinion spread.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, and only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Every time we walk, we will leave traces, such traces, we dig out together.
Source of data: hot search time machine.
Mauritius and other countries have detected the first case of the Omikjon strain - Xinhua
BEIJING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have reported for the first time that cases of infection with the new coronavirus Omikjung virus have been reported for the first time.
Mauritius reported two cases of the Omikjon strain for the first time.
According to the Minister of Health of Mauritius, Kellesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other infected person, a local resident of Mauritius, tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned to South Africa.
After being isolated and treated by the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people have turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed three cases of the Omikjon strain for the first time.
All three were students who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalized because they were all mildly ill.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omikjon strain, the government has continuously increased prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter by air will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will start to vaccinate children between the ages of 5 and 11 in the country with the new Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawi's health minister, Kunbizer Chipunda, said on the 9th that the country has detected three cases of the Omikjon strain for the first time.
The country’s health department sequenced the genomes of 12 new coronavirus-positive samples taken from Nov. 9 to Dec. 2 and found three cases of infection.

Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, 156 South Huancheng Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 to make a basic decoration.
Come to the store and start a series of tricks.
I was the first time I went to the store just to show them my apartment map, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they actually can give me a quote that my 135 house 70,000 can be done, probably showed me their materials do not know what brand of materials they are.
Their second trick is that you’ll just get into the store and you’ll be dragging you to pay the deposit (and once you’ve paid it, you’ll never get back unless you’ve had enough experience to fight them in a theoretical battle with them).
When I hesitated to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much you can give us today.
This is a big pit, I am an example of being cheated alive, and when the mind is impulsive, I have paid more than 10,000 deposit.
He gave me a lot of questions about 70,000 not including the renovation of the water and electricity, not including any doors and cabinets for the bathroom, and these three are the cost of the base.

The starry sky has about the Geminid meteor shower on the 14th ushered in a great deal - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) astronomical science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great deal on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe in the middle of the night.
Beijing astronomy enthusiasts set the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the parent bodies of the meteor shower are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminids is asteroid 3200, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not conceived by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science, said that like the New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release period" can be from December 4 to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroid is slow, rich in color, and many fire meteors, which are suitable for both visual and astronomical photography beginners.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Tianjin Jizhou on December 13, 2020.
According to astronomical forecasts, this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a huge event around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum of 150 ZHR (the number of meteors per hour can be seen when the radiation point is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions).
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'devocative' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, the degree will be a little discount.
On the 14th day of November, the moon phase is the moon, and the bright moonlight will interfere with observation, so that the moon will fall in the middle of the night, and the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the few hours after the fall of the moon in the middle of the night, but pay attention to cold and warm.
How can we see as many stars as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a high altitude, light damage, and open field of view in the suburbs or villages, and then patiently wait until the moon falls, visual observation can be."
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, and it is not necessary to keep an eye on the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography want to shoot a gorgeous "meteor shower blockbuster", it is best to choose a wide angle, large aperture lens, shooting using high ISO and maximum aperture.
Tripods, spare batteries and shutter lines are also essential for stability and continuity.”
Peng Lijun reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
In my understanding, the subject of the traditional TV should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference in the market positioning of laser TV and LCD TV, mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products for large screens.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV size is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meet the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV shipments and sales in the world has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyi Kang, in 2020, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140%, and it will continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why there is such a good result in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source is not directly into the eyeball, compared with the backlight of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The eye experts of the China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute and the Beijing Union Hospital have obtained 144 sets of test data through the strict comparison test of laser TV and LCD TVs under the same conditions.
The data confirm that laser TV does have a strong eye protection characteristics and even has a certain improvement effect in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the current price of commercial laser TV is mostly more than 10,000 yuan, with the upgrade of size and light source, the price gradually climbed.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
Surely it makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and the 100-inch large-screen experience can be realized within a short distance, the required space is not large, and the host is small and the place is small.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition, the heat is lower, the equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Not to mention the pseudo demand, but the product of demand subdivision, on the quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for video players, want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try, everything has pros and cons, weighing your own judgment, you are afraid to listen to the word of faith.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector - laser TV, in order to be close to the curtain, had to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which does not meet the best optical design.
In order to shield some of the ambient light, the use of microstructure of Fresnel curtain, the price of 80 inches can be basically changed to a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate projection manufacturers to take diffuse reflection to the eyes this as a selling point, please, the eyes can see the light on the screen for the eyes is direct light, you diffuse to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, do not have to be more real LCD TV is also diffuse "direct", open the TV ceiling is not illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it cannot be like it at all.
It is just that the hot spot (spot) effect of the high-gain curtain is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.

Added WeChat appointment date, the little sister will be the optional schedule sent to me, reply to the information is more timely ~

But maybe because I didn't communicate specific shooting ideas, it was not the style I wanted, but it should be a good-looking 🙂 🙂
After taking a good shot, the photographer will help select the photos, communicate the late style, and feel very careful.

The environment is generally good.
There are a lot of clothes to choose from.
There are almost three make-up positions, and inside is the studio.
Very warm and attentive.
The stylist is patient.
Photographers will also be very serious about how you act.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to make up the photo.
[Experience] may be a little over the shape, the original eyelids were pasted out of the three eyelids.
The eyebrows were also shaved, which was a bit embarrassing for the daily do not draw eyebrows.
The photo was given ten days ago, but the P-map effect was not very satisfactory, and it was still obvious to feel that the eyelids were attached to those.

I haven’t responded for 3 days... Since your system can’t recognize my credit card, I can’t join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that every time I make a payment, I use the same credit card.
I have to pay the freight every time.
Can you exempt first, and then collect my monthly fee after your investigation, can you do this?
Is it safe to buy insurance?
The Umbrella is an Internet insurance broker.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, it must meet three key words: shareholders and sponsors have no major illegal records in the past three years, and the minimum limit is RMB 50 million before they can be established, and they must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very harsh, summed up is to have the strength, to go through the CBRC (regulatory of insurance companies, banks) of the national authority approval, shareholders to have a good style, as an insurance broker company's small umbrella insurance, the policyholder is not too much questioning the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these three thresholds, not what insurance companies can achieve.
At this point, it’s good, it’s trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star serious illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest on-site and Thai Super Marie No. 5 serious illness insurance, claims and insurers are and Thai life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not have to question its reliable.
From the payment model point of view: Internet platform products, because less business costs of business outlets, and the cost of workers' wages, so the Internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, support monthly payment, reduce the pressure on policyholders' contributions, and can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
can be considered.
From the professional point of view of the salesman: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very strong professional requirements of the industry, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, this will have a lot of misunderstandings, in the health of the information and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often in the insurance will add their subjective awareness, feel that they are healthy or fit, so easy to have a lot of claims hidden dangers, may be rejected risk.
I have done insurance telesales in "Tencent Microinsurance" (like a small umbrella, but also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is true, but also reliable, not reliable people, Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, there are a lot of sales misleading.
For example: 1 yuan insurance 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 serious illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the weight of light, will not tell the insured, the first month 1 yuan, the next month is the need to according to the normal charge, dozens to 200, many customers charge a year or two to buy what is not clear.
I thought that you could spend 1 dollar, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (the pie fell out of the world).
Free delivery of mobile phones, is the policy number such as 6666,888 such as the special policy number of 6666,888, and if the winning SMS is sent, they do not redeem, no one to remind.
(This is another pit for policyholders) Free to receive 60,000 serious illness insurance, is short-term, if only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, 6m thousand can do, can not solve the problem, the future life began to run naked.
At present, the country is also cracking down on the misguided sales of Internet insurance.
So in general, the platform is no problem, the product is no problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are also better than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, underwrite offline products, and save 2000-3000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
I: Mingya insurance broker, has 3 years of experience in business management training, service nearly a thousand enterprise users, cooperate with more than 100 insurance companies, before the insurance, I will start from customer needs, tailored insurance products for customers, insurance, for customers, shop around for customers, try to fight for the best insurance results for customers, after insurance, for customers to do policy finishing, policy hosting, so that customers can rest assured.
Growing with every client.
I hope my answer helps the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is that after the policyholder clicks on the insurance link, he can independently complete all the insurance business of the insurance process.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all the steps can be completed by the policyholder.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance is not too "ritual sense", it may even not even have a printed version of the paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" general assembly line operation, but there will be a fatal problem in buying insurance, that is, follow-up services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades, when we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is not an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us after many years?

No problem, remember no need to arrange a reset, I have bought another, do not want to waste
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and invective, and I can not accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this villain.
If we do not look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that must be resisted first.
From the time you start posting Facebook plus friend requests, and then making hilarious posts, and then you’re trying to post my so-called home location and my father’s name on social media, I’ve taken a non-response attitude.
After you intensified not only the frequency of six meals a day to me, but also in Facebook and your so-called friends continue to recklessly discuss some of my obscure and humiliating remarks about me, appearance, body, good health, what kind of strawberries in bed, do you want to insert and so on, I also counted.
How do I know that later I received a friend who sent a photo of you and a sexual harassment statement about your Facebook account.
As a girl, I can no longer be silent.
After I called the news of the police, you did not converge at all, but more and more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, no matter what status you are, in our society, we need both gender respect.
Yes, you can continue to make this kind of funny, cryptic, humiliating, abusive speech, you can still say that you just love and pay attention to me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can continue to deny that it is not your chart or continue to make all the offensive remarks.
Yes, I can’t and can’t stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need your opinion and body.
I don’t even think any girl would want someone to humiliate herself so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, is it okay?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don’t think any girl can say she’s okay after being so bullied.
In work, society, politics, or business, only those who do not have basic moral character will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of the people.
I left some messages for everyone to comment.
You should have posted yourself, no one can impersonate you.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
Will be smiling.

The U.S. Three Aircraft Carriers Gathering China's Surroundings Rarely Visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional Pro-China Media Multi-dimensional Report: Latest news on China-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are massing around China; U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal is a rare visit to Guam, which sends important signals to U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea strategic situational awareness platform" news, on January 9, the satellite found the USS Carl Vinson near the Barabakra Strait.
The Barabakha Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulho Sea, is a strategic location in the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform is expected to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey.
The U.S. aircraft carrier, which is now squatting in the upper Pacific Ocean, in addition to the USS Vinson, has the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based squadron, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps’ 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided-missile cruiser "Shangpran Lake" and the guided missile destroyer "Stokdar".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" announced the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are massing around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea strategic situational awareness) The U.S. three aircraft carriers gathered around China's most powerful weapons rare visit to Guam on January 17, 2022, the U.S. warship carrier transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam over the weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. Naval Base in Guam on Saturday.
The U.S.-Three-Carriers are gathering China's most powerful weapons near the rare visit to Guam, which analysts say is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
It is the first time a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second public visit since the 1980s.
The U.S. three aircraft carriers are gathering the most powerful weapons around China's rare visit to Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
China's Perpetal Heat Island in the Nansha Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam has strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as Boomer submarines.
The whereabouts of the 14 Thunder Submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder Submarine the “most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad,” including siloed ballistic missiles on the continental United States, as well as nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent Meta fell 26% and the market value evaporated by $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded to "face unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, the revenue mainly comes from advertising, today's money-making advertising company, itself has a traffic channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, no matter what kind of function positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many of the app external Meta's advertising, through Meta's advertising platform is to achieve monetization.
But the times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is difficult to get the user's data information, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will be obvious to remind users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information, and most people's normal reaction is certainly not allowed.
Next, if Google stabbed another knife, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta’s revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta’s revenue comes from China each year, mainly from Chinese companies that make the contribution of the company that makes the business.
Meta has about a few hundred people in Hong Kong, and there are several major agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that can't be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the byte TT is now one of Meta’s main competitors, but Meta can make a lot of money from bytes in the first two years.
Domestic agents are helping bytes to Meta advertising, Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven’t learned anything lately, but it’s certainly not better than before.
The stage of large-scale Chinese companies burning money overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platform, including TT, is not in Meta’s hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in revenue, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at the income, but more importantly, looks at the future expectations.
It is clear that Meta’s expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a more difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current scenery, there are also 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars of revenue every year, in fact, Facebook is now very crisis sense is very strong, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.
Although several of his social software are now relatively high daily life, but also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has no confidence, subversion is the blink of an eye.
And the concept of the metaverse is out of reach, there is no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the company's name, but also constantly looking for the root cause of the new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, is a no way back more than some of my thinking, for reference.
