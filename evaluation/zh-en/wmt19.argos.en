According to British media, the United States Navy Vice-Minister for Operations, Admiral William Moran, continues to focus on the Asia-Pacific region - the Pentagon - to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific region - even as the United States Navy is re-energizing its forces to deal with an increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic.
On September 24, the United States website Jane ' s Defence Weekly reported that Russia and China had been listed as strategic competitors in the new United States defence strategy announced earlier in the year.
Since then, the United States Navy has resumed its second fleet in order to confront Russian activities more directly.
Reports suggest that these moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts about the possibility that the United States Navy might move away from the “Asia-Pacific rebalancing” strategy that marked the Obama Administration.
But Admiral Moran said that the focus of the United States Navy remained on the Western Pacific.
At a round table entitled “Responding to the High Seas Challenge”, organized by the National Asian Research Agency of the United States in Washington on 24 January 2018, he said: “There has been no major change for us. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Moran says: "The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the weight or whatever you want to describe it. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He acknowledged, however, that the United States had close relations with Europe.
He said, "We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Although Moran points out that the general policy on Russia is within the purview of the US Secretary of Defense, he warns: “The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very tough. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Admiral Moran said that, as part of a renewed US operation against Russia, China, and other competitors, the United States Navy was dynamically deploying its forces into a “new mode of combat,” which would help to surprise the enemy’s air carrier battle groups or other assets at any given time and location.
He said, “We the Navy and the Marines support it — the concept of unpredictability of combat, not to appear in the same place again and again, almost as if it were a stroke — this is what we do. It's not like it's a bad idea.
It was reported that the first attempt at this new approach was by the “Hari Truman” carrier battle group, whose early deployment included working visits to the port and patrolling in areas normally only passing through.
Moran said that the United States Navy was currently working to ensure that allies knew that the ships would remain patrolling in traditional areas and was also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
The Royal Australian Navy Commander, Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, also addressed the event, stating that the Australian army could work seamlessly with American carriers.
He said that the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy planned to procure nine additional frigates equipped with a Zeus shield operating system.
We'll need extra money for the next Friday.
Yesterday, air carriers such as Cheung Peng and Okei announced that since 5 October 2018 (the date of issuance of tickets), each passenger on a domestic flight line will receive an additional fuel charge of $20 for fuel and a surcharge of $30 for fuel for each passenger on a flight line of more than 800 kilometres.
As of 5 October 2018 at point 0 (the date of issuance of tickets), the rate for fuel surcharges for domestic routes below 800 km (including) increased from $10 per person to $20 per person and from $10 per passenger to $30 per person for fuel surcharges for domestic routes over 800 km.
Children and uniformed persons are 10 yuan; infants continue to be exempted.
According to the person responsible for the airline ticket, the airline has indicated in its notice that the fuel surcharge is charged on the date of the original ticket and that the surcharge on fuel is not refunded in lieu of the passenger ticket.
This means that domestic airline tickets issued before 5 October will not be supplemented by fuel surcharges at the new standard if they are to be changed to or after 5 October.
Since 5 June 2018, a number of airlines, including Air National, East, Sea, Shanghai, Spring and Autumn, Shenzhen, Western and Oké Air, have resumed collecting fuel surcharges for domestic flights, which have been cancelled for three years, at a standard rate of $10/person.
On this occasion, Cheung Peng and Okay Air announced an increase in fuel surcharges and, as of the time of writing, no news has been received from the country's four major airlines to follow up on the adjustment.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department provides that airlines may decide to charge fuel surcharges on their own by November.
As early as 27 September, it was announced that the recovery of fuel surcharges would begin on 2 November.
According to the TIXA website, all airline tickets issued or reissued by TIXA on or after 2 November will include fuel surcharges for long-distance flights to and from Hong Kong and the South-West Pacific region, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India regions, Africa, and $652 for fuel surcharges and $146 for short-distance flights.
The cost applies to all ticket categories, calculated for each leg, and includes fare quotations for all direct distribution channels in the country.

The Chinese Government stands ready to facilitate and support the observance of its mandate.
Li Keqiang stated that China was committed to the path of peaceful development and to the promotion of economic globalization.
This year marks the fortieth anniversary of China ' s reform and opening up, and, as the world ' s largest developing country, we are ready to pursue common development with all countries in further expanding openness.
Against the backdrop of the rise of protectionism and unilateralism, we would like to join all parties in continuing to consolidate and strengthen partnerships based on the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, to promote development strategies of convergence, to promote “one way forward” cooperation based on the principle of common bargaining and sharing, to work together in defence of multilateralism and free trade, to build an open world economy and to give new impetus to the stable and balanced development of the world economy.
The Ministers of State and Institutions in China warmly congratulated the People ' s Republic of China on its 69th anniversary, conveyed the greetings of the leaders of their respective countries and institutions to China ' s leaders and people, and expressed China ' s great development achievements in the belief that further deepening of reforms and greater openness in the future would provide more development opportunities for the world.
We are ready to play an active role in promoting friendly cooperation between our respective countries and regions and in achieving mutual benefit and win-win.
Subsequently, at the invitation of Li Keqiang, Ministers of State and Agencies in China attended the National Day reception.
Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, attended the event.
On Friday, Ito Commercial, Japan, recognized a impairment loss of $1.3 billion in its investment in China ' s Sino-China shares, recording its largest business investment transaction as a result of trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked through the headquarters of the Society of the Red Marion.
Maroon, for his part, said that he had suspended financial transactions in the agricultural sector of the United States under the banner of the war on trade.
Japan’s heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies and others had warned of the effects of trade friction between China and the United States when they published their latest performances, and now these Japanese trading houses have joined the ranks.
The United States and China are imposing customs duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's commodities, and United States President Trump is threatening to extend the tax to all China's US-Lot goods if the dispute is not resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Financial Secretary for Ito Commercial Affairs, stated that trade disputes could have a greater impact on the Chinese economy next year.
The Ito Commercial and Thai Bee Group invested US$ 10 billion in 2015 in Sino-Tshin, receiving 20 per cent of its shares.
Hachimura alleges that Ito Thong-commercial raised the loss of 143.3 billion yen (USD 1.3 billion) in this shareholding, as it is believed that the value of the CIN stock will not rise in the near future.
Ito has maintained a profit forecast of 500 billion yen for the financial year ended 31 March 2019.
In July, China imposed a 25 per cent import tariff on the soybeans of the United States in order to counter the Washington initiative in trade friction.
"Our grain business has been hit by US-China trade friction," Yanhong finance minister Yanhong said.
He indicated that he had ceased financial transactions in his own account since September.
In his statement on Friday, Gao-hung spokesman Pat Burke stated that the company had done so “in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to lack of market opportunities”. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He also indicated that the suspension of financial transactions would not result in job losses.
Maroon red maintains an annual profit estimate of 230 billion yen, supported by pulp and paper and power generation.
“The trade problems between the United States and China have led to uncertain prospects. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Mitsubishi Commercials increased the annual profit estimate to record levels on Friday, owing to increased coal-charting production and higher prices for large commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Commercial also announced a new business plan that seeks to increase the profits for the fiscal year up to 31 March 2022 from an estimated 640 billion yen this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion).
On November 5th, China Newsnet posted a comprehensive report that the U.S. midterm election polls are now in countdown.
On 4 November, President Trump and his Democratic opponents were active in “throwing” votes to their core constituents.
Both parties stated that voter turnout would be the key to the elections.
It was reported that, 48 hours before the popular vote in the United States, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidate's campaign, while former President Barack Obama travelled to Indiana to stand on the Democratic Federal Senate candidate Joe Donnelly, who was anxious to vote, and to shout to the crowd his final claim before the election.
On 4 November, Trump went to Maygan, Georgia, to stand for the Republican candidate for governorship, Brian Kemp, and said, “You have to go to the polling station on Tuesday and you have to vote. It's not like it's a bad idea.
“This election cannot be compared more clearly. It's not like we're going anywhere.
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, and early voting has gone far beyond normal in some cantons.
Successive Presidents of the United States face the first mid-term election, and the number of members of Parliament belonging to his party tends to decrease.
According to the Washington Post and a new poll published on 4 December by the BBC News Network, while the Democratic Federal House of Representatives continues to have an advantage, Republicans can benefit from an economic assessment and from Trump ' s strict attention to border security.
The poll shows that registered voters prefer the Democrats to Republican candidates in the House of Representatives, at 50% to 43%, but that there is still a drop in the 14 percentage points ahead of August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also shows that Democrats are still 7 percentage points ahead of Republicans.
According to the news, Obama said to the crowd on the occasion of Senator Donnelly: “When people don’t tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there is bound to be bad consequences.
Democracy will not work when people lie to themselves. It's not like we're going anywhere.
“The only way to stop these Republicans now is by you and your vote. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The Democratic Party has faced the most difficult elections in the Senate for decades, and currently holds half of the Republicans ' 51 seats.
However, the House of Representatives is more favourable, and the Democrats need 23 more seats to be able to take control of the House of Representatives with 435 seats.
According to a forecasted analyst at the FiveThirtyEight.com website, the Democratic Party is expected to win 85% of the House.
The National Political Consultative Council (CNP) convened an important seminar on the theory of ideas for strengthening and improving the work of CPH.
The National Political Consultative Council held an important intellectual seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the Council, held in Kyoto from 29 to 30 October.
Wangyang, Chairman of the National Political Consultative Council, Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the CCP, attended and addressed the Conference.
He stressed that the Secretary-General Xi had a critical idea of strengthening and improving the work of the Council, which provided a clear picture of its status, objectives, responsibilities and practical requirements, and that science had answered a number of important issues of orientation, globality and strategic importance and was a powerful intellectual weapon to guide the work of the Council for the New Age.
It is important to learn to follow up on this important idea and to grasp its significance, richness and spirituality. It is important to learn and learn to do well. It is important to promote the quality of the work of the Political Consultative Council with theoretical learning and intellectual energy. It is important to take up the new mission of the Association.
From 29 to 30 September, the Political Consultative Council held a seminar in Beijing on the critical intellectual theory of General Secretary Xi Jinping in strengthening and improving the work of the Council.
Wang Yang pointed out that, since the 18th Congress of the Party, the General Secretary of Xi has proposed a new set of ideas to strengthen and improve the work of CPH. For the first time, it was proposed that CPH is an important channel and specialized consultative body for socialist consultation and democracy. It is an important part of the system of governance. It is an essential part of the system of governance of the country. It is an institutional arrangement that is unique to China. For the first time, it sets out the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system. It emphasizes the proper management of the relationship between coherence and diversity. It provides a profound insight into the people's democratic reality, which lies in the negotiation of matters and in the negotiation of people's issues. It reveals the logical link between `government in China' and China's political system. It is the culmination of deep-seated theoretical thinking that adheres to the good and develops the good people's civil affairs system.
Wangyang stressed that the PCA at all levels would use theoretical learning seminars as an opportunity to further identify weaknesses and shortcomings in PCA ' s work and to build on and improve efforts and breakthroughs.
The establishment of the PACS party should be strengthened in a comprehensive manner to ensure that its central decision-making deployment is carried out through the PAC process.
It is necessary to strengthen intellectual and political leadership, improve systems, procedures and mechanisms for building political capacity and building consensus, and put it into practice in all areas and throughout the process.
The focus will be on fulfilling due diligence, better complying with the services of the Party and the State, better quality of representation and more effective performance.
It is necessary to strengthen its capacity-building, to train its members and cadres, to play the basic role of the Independent Commission and to strengthen its functioning.
It is important to strengthen the guidance provided to the local councils in order to guide, demonstrate, solve problems and raise the overall level of their work.
With a view to following up on Xi's new Chinese socialist ideology and the 19th spirit of the Party, in May the National Political Consultative System began an important intellectual study seminar on the strengthening and improvement of the work of the Human Rights and Civil Affairs Association by holding eight regional and seven expert seminars, identifying 18 priority topics and six basic theoretical topics, with a total of 79.38 million members at all levels and 279,000 officials at all levels participating in studies and seminars, resulting in more than 36,000 research papers.
On November 5th, the People's Network Beijing (King Xiaoyan) in the current wave of “public entrepreneurship, innovation and innovation”, a growing number of scientific and technological companies have begun to focus on patent research and development and related protection, deepening the potential value of patents and taking over market ownership.
Similarly, a number of technological enterprises have experienced numerous abuses in the areas of licensing, use of patented technologies, etc.
At the end of 2017, the developers of the “trip-out” APP, Beijing Orange Technology Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Orange Technology), the operator of the "trip-out" Technology Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Drop-out) and the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the Guangdong Pacific) sued the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court for patent infringement.
The plaintiffs requested the court to order that the defendants immediately cease the manufacture, sale, promise of sale and use of the plaintiff ' s patent.
On October 30, 2018, China’s Network of Judicatures published “civil decisions at first instance in disputes over patent rights to inventions, such as Tam Wei, Ho Zhanghong, and Beijing Orange Technology Ltd.”, which discloses some details of cases in which an APP has been sued for patent infringement.
According to the three plaintiffs, “Moving service systems and methods based on mobile terminals” Patent rights holders and inventors, while the entire operation of the “windmill” application in the “trip-out” of the APP corresponds to the technical programme of patent protection in question and constitutes patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Orangetech argued that the Guangdong Pacific Ocean was not an appropriate defendant, that it had simply provided a free download on the web of the APP “trip trip” involved, that it had not applied the patent method involved, that there had been no direct or indirect tort and that it should not be listed as the defendant in the case.
Secondly, the violations in this case were not committed in Guangdong.
The law provides that the tort of the patent in question shall be the place where the patent method in question is applied in its entirety, and therefore challenges the jurisdiction of the court by requesting that the case be referred to the court of the domicile of the defendant, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Court of Intellectual Property Rights found that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, had provided the alleged tortious APP product on its web platform and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to include the defendant Guangdong Pacific as the defendant.
The defendant was also domiciled in Guangzhou City under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Orange Tech, argued that the case should be referred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, on insufficient grounds, and rejected the defendant, Orange Tech Ltd., ' s challenge to the jurisdiction of the case and the costs of the jurisdiction challenge case.
Other proceedings in the case have not yet been made public and journalists will also follow closely the follow-up details of the patent violation cases.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research: The achievements of science and technology cooperation in Australia are significant
“China's science and technology have developed rapidly over the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by working together in the field of science. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research, said in a recent interview with the China News Agency in Beijing that Australian cooperation in the field of science and technology was vibrant, from the fight against climate change to the Eye.
CSIRO, the largest national scientific research agency in the Australian Commonwealth, has achieved many innovative research results that have gained world attention in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomicals, etc.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“It is a lasting friendship that embraces a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with partners. Marshall said.
In May of this year, China's 500-metre Sphere Radio Telescope, the China Sky Eye, installed the first international 19-beam L-band receiver.
This is currently the most advanced international 19-beam feed receiver, developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall stated that the successful development of the receiver was based on the years of technological accumulation of CSIRO, which would result in a five- to six-fold increase in the speed of the FAST skyscraper, and the expansion of scientific observation targets.
"This is part of CSIRO's contribution to FAST. It's not like we're going anywhere.
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO has been working closely with Chinese scientific institutions in the construction of a square kilometre array radio telescope, the development of new fuel technologies and the reduction of energy-saving emissions.
“The scientific research of the past has tended to focus on issues that are a hundred years later, and now more research is needed to solve the problems before it. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Marshall believed that the two countries were complementary in the area of scientific development, while both faced a range of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather events are frequent around the globe, drought and floods lead to reduced food production and food shortages seriously affect human development.
At the same time, the problems of population explosion, ageing and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
“The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused mainly on resolving these current challenges. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Marshall described the International Center for Marine Research in the Southern Hemisphere, established by CSIRO together with the Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, which focused on observing El Niño and La Niña phenomena, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather events and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather, and the new varieties of cereals to overcome extreme weather, developed jointly by CSIRO and the Central College, which could also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
“In the current environment, where science, technology and innovation are difficult to achieve on their own, where the costs are extremely high, and where there are many issues to be addressed, cooperation is particularly important today. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Marshall stated that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it would be to make breakthroughs, was also the point of closer cooperation between the two sides in the context of the “one way forward”.
“Intension of bilateral cooperation is primarily scientific and technological for us. It's not like we're going anywhere.
Marshall, for example, CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, which is very harmful to the environment because of traditional cyanide gold purification, and many countries wish to find a gold purification method that is less polluting to the environment.
“We are very willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our cooperation on the `road'. It's not like it's a bad idea.
On 29th, the 2018 Poo-Chicken Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Cooperation Concertation was held in Urumqi, Xinjiang, where guests, while appreciating the achievements of the Poo-Chicken development, appreciated local food and felt local history and culture.
During the month prior to the event, a series of high-density and wide-ranging tourism promotion campaigns were conducted in eight cities along the Silk Road, including Tian Shui, Hiranzhou, Silvergawa, Sineen, Zhang Xuan and Hami, which provided a good basis for the successful launch of the 2018 Chicken Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Cooperation Talks.
In his presentation, the Mayor of Poo-Chicken City in Shaanxi Province, Kee-jin, has a long history of culture and a strong industrial base. He is the second largest city in Shaan-xi Province and the secondary centre of the Guangxi Economic Zone and the Guan-Cheng Plains, and the main nodal city along the “one way along” initiative.
In recent years, the City of Poo-Chicken has continued to upgrade industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open heights and human cohesion, accelerating catch-up and high-quality development.
At the meeting, a strategic cooperation agreement on tourism was signed between the Pork City Tourism Development Commission and the Urumqi Tourist Board.
At the same time, travel agencies in Xinjiang have signed tourism cooperation agreements with the Poo-Yugawa Tourist Area, the Buddhist Cultural Landscape of the French Temple, the Ta Bai Mountains Tourist Landscape, and the Guanshan Grassscape Landscape.
The Chief of the Market Promotion Section of BOXC said: “In the Great U.S. Xinjiang, some of the tourist resources are complementary to the rooster. We traveled all the way to Xinjiang to introduce the roosters, the roosters, the naturals, etc., and to select more than 500 photographs to show the roosters’ beauty. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The event, which focused on tourism resources, tourism projects, tourist routes, etc., promoted the overall image of ferocious chicken tourism, high-quality tourism products and quality tourism industries, consolidated the Xinjiang customer market, singed the brand “Looking at China's Chicken”, raised the influence and visibility of the City of ferocious chickens in the north-west, and attracted more visitors from the Xinjiang region to the experience of chicken tourism.
According to Feng Xu, Deputy Director-General of the Bureau of Marketing of the City of Poo-Chicken, “The event brought together the various departments of the City of Poo-chung, the districts and the development regions to coordinate the implementation of a number of good and large projects.
To date, 41 signed projects have been implemented, for a total amount of 26,043 million yuan. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In recent years, the Poo-Chickens have continued to upgrade industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open heights and human cohesion around the goals of building internationalized cities along the “one-way” initiative, equipping manufacturing cities, historic and cultural cities and beautiful and happy cities that are fit to live in. This has accelerated catch-up and high-quality development.
In 2017, the total value of regional production was 2,18 billion yuan, an increase of 8.7 per cent.
He has been awarded more than 20 national honours, including the National Civilization City, the National Ecological Park City and the China Habitat Environmental Prize.
Mr. Yan Na-min, Deputy Mayor of the Urumqi City Council, said that Urumqi, as a major town on the New North Road on the Silk Road, had a special geographical advantage, connecting the North and South of Tianshan, connecting Xinjiang and the Mainland, connecting China with Central Asia, West Asia and Europe, was an important gateway to China ' s economic and cultural exchanges to the west, and had a good investment climate.
The event, which focused on the manufacturing of equipment, logistics and commerce, and tourism industry, was marked in Urumqi by a spirit of complicity and cooperation.
At the Conversation, Xinjiang local merchants signed six projects involving a sum of RMB 3.25 billion with the districts of Poo chicken.
On the same day, foreign guests such as the representative of Kyrgyzstan to the visa office in Urumqi, the Russian law firm of New Siberia, the representative of the Tajik Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Urumchi and the representative of the Russian Chamber of Commerce of Tatarstan attended the meeting.
Some 500 participants from the Urumqi City Admission Bureau, the Business Bureau, the Agricultural and Livestock Directorate, the Tourism Board, and enterprises and the media participated.
The revitalization of the north-east is a matter of national development.
Industrial enterprises in the north-east are more important and well founded, and for the north-east innovation is development and innovation is the future.
Can the old industrial base be re-energized, released, and the Secretary-General's heart moved.
On Saturday, the DPRK Foreign Minister, Li Yong-ho, stated to the United Nations that the continued imposition of sanctions was deepening North Korea ' s mistrust of the United States and that it could not unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Lee Yong-ho stated at the United Nations General Assembly that the DPRK had adopted a “very friendly approach” over the past year, including the cessation of missile and nuclear tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and a commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“If there is no trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security. In such circumstances, we cannot give up our weapons unilaterally. It's not like it's a bad idea.
While Li Yong-ho repeated the DPRK's complaint against the United States' opposition to “phased” denuclearization, his statement was of great significance, as there was no complete rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as had been the case with the DPRK before.
Li Yong-ho referred to the joint statement of Kim Jong-un and Trump on 12 June, when Kim agreed to “denuclearize” the Korean peninsula, while Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
The DPRK has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States claims that it must first renounce nuclear weapons.
The United States has also refused to ease its demand for international sanctions against the DPRK.
“The United States insists on `denuclearization first' and on increasing the pressure of sanctions to achieve its objectives by means of high-handedness, even refusing to issue a `declaration of the end of the war', according to Li Yong Ho.
“The idea that sanctions can make us beg for forgiveness on our knees is that those who do not know us are dreaming.
But the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust. It's not like we're going anywhere.
Lee Yong-ho did not mention the United States President's second Special Fund plan, mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim Jong-un and the President of Korea over the past five months, saying: “If the other party to denuclearize is Korea, not Korea, then denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so deadlocked. It's not like it's a bad idea.
China announced a reduction in import duties for 1585 tax purposes, effective 1 November 2018.
Since this year, China has taken successive initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
On 1 May of this year, a total reduction in taxes on medicines was introduced, with zero tariff adjustments for imports for 28 tax purposes, including all generic drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, as well as non-cancer-resistant bio-alkali drugs and actual imports of Chinese medicine.
At the same time, the value added tax on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has been reduced considerably.
On 1 July, taxes were reduced on cars and spare parts for 218 tax purposes.
With the reduction in taxes, China ' s total car tariff rate is below the average for developing countries and is consistent with the actual Chinese automobile industry.
This reduction will drive industrial restructuring and optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the gains and losses, help to improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to contribute to some extent to the price adjustment of cars and increase consumer benefits.
On 1 July, taxes were reduced on daily consumer goods for 1,449 tax purposes.
The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods is closely linked to the needs of people for a better life.
The tax reduction was not only significant but also significant, with an average of 56 per cent.
Declining taxes on consumer daily goods directly benefit a wide range of consumers and promote competitiveness in domestic industries.
On 1 November, taxes will be imposed on industrial items such as electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials for 1585 tax purposes.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs on imports of much-needed industrial goods in some parts of the country can attract more foreign investment, help to increase efficient domestic supply and boost industrial upgrading, and help enterprises to allocate resources globally, reduce production costs and reduce domestic environmental stress.
The head of the office of the Customs and Excise Commission of the Chinese State Council explained that the above-mentioned four autonomous tax reductions, as well as the third step of the reduction, implemented on 1 July this year, in accordance with the outcome of negotiations on the expansion of the information technology agreement, would reduce China ' s overall tariff level from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent.
The total level of adjusted tariffs is slightly higher than that of the EU, is lower than that of most developing countries and is at a moderate low level, substantially matching China ' s developing country status and development phase.
The Officer-in-Charge described the overall level of tariffs as one of the important indicators of the openness of China ' s trade in goods, which should be adapted to the stage of China ' s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
While China ' s global trade in goods is number one and the economic base for further liberalization is in place, there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development and that of developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be properly reduced.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance, and tariff levels should be commensurate with industrial competitiveness, encourage good competition and over-protect against industrial development and quality.
The adjustment of tariff rates needs to balance production and consumption needs.
The focus is on lowering commodity tariffs for higher domestic demand and contributing to the upgrading of industries, working to increase imports of niche products with a higher concentration of demand among the population, increasing the awareness of enterprises and the public, and meeting the upgrading needs of industrial and consumer structures.
Tax reductions need to balance fiscal revenues with the affordability of industrial development.
The choice of specific tax-deductible goods and tax-deductive margins needs to be balanced between domestic and foreign markets, upstream and downstream, production and consumption, and to preserve China ' s steady medium-to-medium economic momentum.
The Director-General stressed that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening up of the country, and that China ' s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is based on China ' s own major initiative to achieve high-quality development needs. It is conducive to the integrated use of both international and foreign resources, the promotion of the quality of domestic supply systems and the satisfaction of the population ' s consumption needs.
This action and initiative demonstrates China ' s firm commitment to a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, its firm support for economic globalization, its firm commitment to the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system, with WTO at its core, and its continued efforts to draw development momentum from its openness to the world and to better benefit China ' s development.
Serbia has declared a state of maximum alert.
SPK cited information from the Office of the President of Serbia that, in view of the occupation by the Kosovo Special Forces of access to the Lake of the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo, which is controlled by the Belgrade side, President Vucić of Serbia ordered the country ' s armed forces to enter maximum operational readiness.
On 29 September, the Minister of Defence of Serbia declared that the Serbian army was in full operational readiness.
It stressed that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the orders issued by Vucić remained in force and that the Serbian Army would respond regardless of the direction in which the situation proceeded.
According to Russian Tas, on 29 September, during an interview, Vucić stated that he had briefed the United States and Russia on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on 2 October to meet with Russian President Putin to seek his support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vucić answered in the negative: “I do not want a major military conflict on our territory.” It's not like it's a bad idea.
Vucić also stated that the full operational readiness of the Army was only intended to create a deterrent to the conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no violence would be tolerated in Kosovo.
The increase in the operational readiness of the Serbian Army is linked to two major moves on the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days Albanian arrests in northern Kosovo for generations of Serbs residing there have been carried out in flagrant violation of the law.
Vucić claims that since the beating and detention of Mark Yuric, head of the office of the Government of Serbia for Kosovo and Metohija, on 26 March this year, the ethnic Albanian community has escalated the situation in the region by carrying out inhuman arrests and displacements of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 persons, including the ROSU Special Forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, armed police and snipers, who were previously self-proclaimed, occupied positions near the water catchment lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station, entered the ecological and sports centres near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo and blocked all nearby roads, which were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucić states that this military adventure in Kosovo was carried out at the instigation of Western countries and that the actions of the Kosovo Army were not notified to the Serbian side in advance, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the military-technical agreement between Serbia and the United Nations Security Council.
Vucić has already spoken to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocrisy of Western countries with regard to Kosovo.
The root cause of this conflict remains centuries-old historical grievances between the two communities in Kosovo.
There are separate claims of Serb and Albanian affiliation to Kosovo.
Serbia views Kosovo as the cradle of its nationhood and culture, because it established its most powerful country here in the twelfth century, and the Albanians moved in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invasion and the fall of the Serb Army to the north.
Albanians, for their part, maintain that the original tribe of Ilyria, which lived in Kosovo in the 4th and 5th century B.C., is an ethnic Albanian ancestry and that Kosovo has thus been an ethnic Albanian territory since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have resulted in intense ethnic, religious and cultural conflict, leading to a sharp confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
Following the First World War, large numbers of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with a relative increase in the Serb share, which, in the eyes of the Serbs, “only take back their own land”, was plundered by Albanians as “Greater Serb”, exacerbating tensions between the two communities.
Kosovo has become a “powder barrel” in the Balkans.
In 1999, armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO troops and the outbreak of war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, despite news that Serbia will normalize its relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it has not been possible to conclude an agreement that is subject to the forces of the United States and Russia, owing to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
For the first time, just a month ago, Vucić made it clear that he was advocating the separation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo and once again made the tension between the two communities public.
Power communication is still out.
According to figures published by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of the 30th day, a strong earthquake and tsunami in Dungara district in the central Sulawesi province of the country on 28 February had resulted in 420 deaths.
According to Wilem Rampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, this figure is only a preliminary count of the city of Palu, capital of Central Sulawesi, approximately 80 kilometres from the epicentre of the earthquake, as many of the city ' s heavily populated buildings, such as hotels, malls and warehouses, which were damaged or destroyed by the earthquake, have not been searched.
On 29 September 2018, local time, a bridge damaged by earthquakes and tsunamis collapsed in Bali, Indonesia.
As a result of the severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the earthquake in Dingala district and the adjacent Sigi region are still unconnected “on the island” and it is not possible to count the number of victims.
The media reported that Vice-President Kara of Indonesia had claimed the death toll or thousands.
Power cuts, communications interruptions, road blockages, airport damage... and severe earthquake and tsunami relief difficulties.
As a result of power cuts, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu city were required to generate electricity from fuel.
Roads to and from the city have been blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles, including tankers, have been prevented from accessing the city, thus straining fuel supplies.
The Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus, stated that emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food and household kits, which the Ministry had transferred from the provinces of South Sulawesi and Colontaro in the adjacent earthquake zone, had not yet reached the affected areas because of road damage.
Disaster relief supplies shipped from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported via air carriers to the affected areas.
In view of the damage caused by the earthquake to the Palu airport tower and runway, all commercial flights have been suspended to ensure the safety and security of the rescue, allowing only military aircraft transporting relief supplies and personnel to take off.
The Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who was in charge of the rescue in the earthquake zone, Vilanto, called for the rapid resumption of electricity supply and commercial air services at the airport to ensure the functioning of relief agencies, such as hospitals, and to allow more relief workers and volunteers and aid supplies to reach the affected areas.
A series of strong earthquakes occurred in Dingara district, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, in which a Class 7.7 earthquake at 1702 hours local time triggered a tsunami that caused a major disaster in the city of Palu, Dungara district and the Sigi region.
On October 1st in Beijing, China News Agency (journalist) Baek-baum, Yen-suk, Yen-suk-suk-suk... In recent days, Beijing has continued to open its most beautiful blue sky model, drawing thousands of people on social platforms to enjoy their happiness in a continuous screen, calling it “the “drinked” skyline under the blue sky, which is the best business card in Beijing.”
Since August, Beijing has received "the blueest sky".
Within the city, people can be seen and photographed anywhere, with smartphones or with a single back camera.
On social platforms such as Weibo, the Wireless Friends Circle, you can see the ancient palaces, Tiananmen, the nests, the alleys... all kinds of buildings under the blue sky.
Netizens say that such a “small film” is the best urban poster in Beijing; and that if such a blue sky were to be painted for a long time, those with cervical vertebrates would be cured; and even more so, they would like to see “the blue springs up and summers up, so that the four seasons of the sky in the city will be blue.”
Why do the people of the capital love the blue sky?
People who used to live in this city suffer from mists that make them yearn for the blue sky, and after Beijing’s “Blue Sky” war, which continues to improve the quality of air, the fog gets smaller, the sky increases, and the sense of happiness that people see in their eyes is particularly important.
On the Fourth of July, Beijing weather was fine.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring sites throughout the city showed green as “first-class”.
On the social platform, the people's self-sponsible “Blue Sky” theme photography contest continues.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing?
According to the competent officials of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Agency, the average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 ug/m3, the best recorded for the same period in almost five years.
The real-time PM2.5 concentration in September was more frequent.
A major factor in the emergence of “the blue sky” is the overall favourable weather conditions in recent times and, more importantly, the persistence of atmospheric pollution management in Beijing, the vigorous promotion of the Clean Air Action Plan over the past five years, and the continued release of environmental benefits, which have resulted in a reduction in the region's total pollutant emissions, all of which have laid the foundation for sustained improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing City Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
Under the plan, the Government has continuously directed non-capitalization and promoted energy clean-up alternatives and pollution reduction, resulting in the elimination of 4923 coal-fired boilers.
As a result, Beijing became the first major city in the interior of China to be fully gasged.
The data show a cumulative decline of 35.6 per cent in average PM2.5 in Beijing between 2013 and 2017; an increase of 50 days in air quality; an increase of 25 days in first-class good days; and a reduction of 35 days in heavy pollution, with a marked decrease in the incidence of heavy pollution.
While air quality continues to improve, Beijing officially released in September this year the Beijing Three-Year Plan of Action to Win the Blue Sky on the basis of a new round of PM2.5, focusing on the current phase of governance and pollution characteristics, focusing on priority areas of control, such as diesel trucks, dust risers, and volatile organic matter management, optimizing transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures, and land use, strengthening regional anti-control controls, strengthening city precision management, and promoting green development in a comprehensive manner, seeking to keep “the blueest sky” in the city, away from being “frequently expensive” and returning it to the background of people, rather than the main actor.
During this year's National Day of Gold, the relevant departments, such as the Municipal Tourism Council, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the City Department and the Public Security, will intensify their law enforcement inspections of the “one-day tour” market, focusing on the “six blacks” of tourism, and those who violate the law will be subject to severe and severe penalties in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipality convened a meeting on the topic of illegal “one day tour” to deploy a special operation to further the illegal “one day tour”.
It was revealed at the meeting that the city had launched an illegal “one-day tour” campaign since 28 July, in which “six black” images of the interlocking black ballot paper, black conductor, black car, black shop, black-networked interests were linked.
To date, the initiative has received 39 “one day trip” complaints, a decrease of 63 per cent; since this year, 270 “one day trip” complaints, a decrease of 62 per cent.
Over the past two months, 248 “black cars” have been seized throughout the city, 158 cases of traveler traffic violations have been recorded, 29 shopping “black shops” and theatres have been closed, 13 “black houses” and 27 “blackmen” have been seized, 26,000 illegal advertisements have been confiscated, 31 illegal “a day tour” billboards have been removed, 3 public transport card plates have been removed, 1,789 offences involving various types of travel-related offences have been investigated, 181 cases have been filed by various functional departments, resulting in heavy fines of $4.48 million, and 111 persons have been detained for offences involving travel-related offences.
As a result of the rehabilitation, illegal “one day-swap” likes were largely contained, and the “one day-swap” market order showed a steady medium-to-good trend.
It was described that in recent years the city has been increasing its efforts to combat illegal “one day trip”.
In 2016 and 2017, the City Tourism Board received 1612 and 897 “one day trip” complaints, representing a decrease of 79 per cent and 44 per cent, respectively, but illegal “one day trip” continued to be repeated, with frequent rebounds and the emergence of “six black” entanglements of interest chains such as black ballot notes, black conductors, black cars, black shops, and black networks.
In particular, illegal street trafficrs, i.e. “black tickets”, illegal websites that publish false travel information, illegal “a day tour” travel agencies or agencies or individuals that do not have the qualifications of travel agents, i.e. “black shops”, or “black shops” for guides hired by “black houses” who do not have a guided tour permit or engage in irregular practices, or for vehicles that do not have tourist travel funds, or for vehicles that provide passenger services for illegal “a day tour”, i.e. “black cars”, which eventually bring tourists to designated tourist shopping shops.
In this special operation, regular inspections and mobile patrols of illegal “one day trip” have been stepped up. In response to the high incidence of illegal “one day trip” and high-impact tourist route points, the authorities concerned have sent on a daily basis undercover teams to take part in unannounced visits to find evidence of violations of the law, and they are subject to strict investigation in accordance with the law.
Among them, “black cars” and “black shops” have become the main focus of the special operations.
It was described that illegal “one day trip” could not take place without black cars, which were easy to detect, remember and trace, as well as single-value fixed assets.
Using road traffic surveillance cameras, the authorities have increased their supervision of tourist buses on the “one-day trip” route, and technical and technical intelligence, such as protection and physical protection, can be used to detect “black cars” in a timely manner.
Tourism shopping “black shops” are also the focus of attention because of their small number and location.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and repression of illegal “one-day trips”, whenever a violation of the law is found to have been committed in a special operation, all the competent authorities are subject to severe penalties in accordance with the law.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on the legal aspects of combating illegal “one day trip”, which examined the means of combining administrative penalties with criminal conviction.
The City Tourism Commission has indicated that more regular travel agencies will be encouraged in the future to undertake a “one day tour” of Beijing and to increase the supply of regular “one day trip” in order to further crowd out illegal “one day trip” living spaces, and specific programmes are still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Board has continued to refine the Mission ' s e-routine information system to ensure that each team is placed under the supervision of the E-route platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what have you been through all these years?
As the permanent venue for the World Internet Congress, the way in which the town of Ursin has taken on the Summit dividend is a matter of great concern.
In the five years since the first World Internet Congress, the changes in the town have been visible.
In 2014, there were only 12 businesses throughout the town related to the digital economy and the Internet, and by the third quarter of this year there had been over 500.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in the town.
The convening of an Internet conference has allowed local firms to accept the inspiration of the digital economy and the wave of digitalization at zero distance, and there is a strong desire for enterprise transformation to upgrade, and traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their inputs and research and development in terms of machine change, intelligent management, etc.
The Secretary-General of the Union Township Party, Kang Yan, stated that the future of the town would build a new economic empowerment centre.
The development of the digital economy cannot be sustained without infrastructure.
This year, the town launched a 5G pilot on the basis of a 4G communications network and free WiFi coverage.
At the same time, the town of Kiryu commune, the first county-level city in the country to have a dedicated access to international Internet data, has become a hotbed for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Congress, 565 projects in the digital economy have been introduced, with a total planned investment of $37,725 million, and the core manufacturing sector of the digital economy achieved a total output of $8.73 billion in the first three quarters of the year, a 13% increase in value added.
“The town was a tourist symbol, followed by drama and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet Congress, it is now the Internet and digital economy symbol. It's not like we're going anywhere.
In the view of the Secretary-General of Kiryucheng City, the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time, and it is therefore all the more necessary to build a platform to take on a confluence of talents, projects, technologies, etc.
Shen Yi has been working outside the country for 20 years and has returned to start a business in connection with the Internet Congress.
On 2 December last year, he walked into the fourth Internet Light Fair with a high-capacity digital-proof solution and was favoured by many clients.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in U-town, not only because of her home-town problems, but also because it was easier to recruit people than I thought, and because our applications landed quickly and our applications were found in the U-town Smart Parking Project. It's not like it's a bad idea.
A U-town road presents the spillover effect of the Internet Congress.
This road, which runs north and south of Kiryu commune, not only links tourist attractions, but also industrial roads.
It was used as a basis for the creation of the Zone of the U-town Boulevard.
Journalists have learned that in the future U-town Boulevard will be the main venue for the development of Kiryu commune industry, spearheading the application of intellectual medicine, intellectual ageing, intelligent politics and so on, bringing together industry and many high-level talent who account for 80 per cent of the city ' s GDP.
At least 410 people have been killed in the tsunami caused by the strong earthquake in Indonesia.
According to the Director of the Public Information Department of the Indonesian Police in Jakarta on the night of 29, the earthquake in Central Sulawesi has now caused 410 deaths, 97 of whom have been identified.
Another 29 persons were missing and 540 were injured.
Palu airport remains closed.
Active treatment, with China’s survival rate of 98 per cent in 29 weeks or more of premature births, has reached the level of developed countries.
On September 30, China News Online, the National Children's Medical Centre and the University of Jordan Hospital for Paediatrics, announced the introduction of Canada's advanced methods into the Chinese National College of Hospital Prenatal Quality Improvement Project.
The results of the project show that, after active treatment, China’s survival rate for 29 weeks and more of premature births has reached 98%, reaching the level of developed countries, but there is still room for considerable improvement in the early birth of very young babies without complications.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese Government has focused on the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per 1,000 live births, significantly below the national average and reaching advanced levels in developed countries.
In China, the NCIU Hospital Prenatal Quality Improvement Project for Early Births has significantly improved the quality of life of premature births through four years of sustained effort.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Newborn Severe Care Unit of the Paediatric Hospital of the University of Jordan, stated to journalists that while increasing the survival rate of premature babies, he was concerned with reducing the quality of survival of premature babies, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the overall outcome after neurodevelopment, and improving the overall quality of life and the quality of the population, which is important for improving the overall survival of premature babies, both at home and abroad, as well as for the newborn community.
The China National Programme for the Improvement of the Pre-natal Quality of Inpatient Prenatal Births in China, through four years of tireless efforts to record tens of thousands of premature births up to 33 weeks of age in the country, has resulted in a one-third reduction in the mortality rate of young births and premature births of small birth weights, while the incidence of serious complications of premature births has decreased significantly and has significantly improved the quality of survival of premature births.
Through the establishment of a nationwide collaboration network for the improvement of the quality of newborns, the project introduced the concept of collaborative quality improvement, radiationizing 25 collaborating hospitals across China, and establishing a comprehensive, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement methodology for the improvement of pre-natal care and care for newborns, adapted to the national context.
The Paediatric Hospital of the University of Jordan is working with the national Neonatal Unit to develop guidelines for the treatment and treatment of newborn infections based on the project ' s accumulated experience and to provide reference and guidance for the standard treatment of newborn infections in China.
It is understood that under the China Prenatal Quality Improvement Project, Paediatric Hospitals have introduced the EPIQ methodology into 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces of the country, working to address the problems of premature infections that plague the care of newborns in China.
After more than 10 years of improvement, the national survival rate for premature births has increased by about one third, and Canada is now among the best countries in the world to expect premature births.
The EPIQ methodology has now been applied to all NCUs in Canada and has been adopted in six countries.
According to the Paediatric Hospital, two years after EPIQ intervention, pre-natal infections fell by 35%, while antibiotics use fell by 20%.
In the future, the paediatric hospital attached to the University of Jordan will continue to promote and implement this approach nationwide, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications associated with premature births and improving the quality of care for newborns throughout the country.
At this time, there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in various regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important building unit of the National Centre for Children ' s Medicine, the paediatric hospital will play a leading radiological role. The study will cover the western provinces of Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Xuanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal care throughout the country.
It is understood that the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Jordan is working with the national Neonatal Unit to develop guidelines for the treatment and treatment of newborn infections, based on the experience gained through the project, and to provide reference and guidance for the normative treatment of newborn infections in China.
In 2019, it was revealed that the Coordinating Centre, located in the Chinese Newborns Network, attached to the Paediatric Hospital at the University of Jodan, would unite 63 hospitals throughout the country to carry out the next phase of nationwide quality improvements, with a view to promoting the development of parity in the treatment of newborns in China.
The Director of the Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission (SPMPC) expressed the view that Shanghai could become a central city for Asia, not only in terms of research, but also in terms of the construction of an entire service system, the quality of services and their results should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China’s health care.
Censorship: Building the Heart of Heroes — written on the Fifth Martyr's Day.
On 30 September, on the eve of the Republic ' s 69-year-old birth, we welcomed the fifth Martyr ' s Day, and Xi ' s Equality Party and national leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend a ceremony to offer flowers to the heroes of the people.
At this time, wherever you are, I salute you.
The Day of Remembrance is a renewal and a wake-up call.
Turning to a thick history, the name of every martyr is a living life.
They are also hot youths, true love and family.
However, because of their belief that “the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe”, they are willing to sacrifice everything to “exempt the suffering of the next generation”.
"I have to cry for China the day I survive."
Through time and space, the British set up a spiritual sign that guides the way forward.
"Where you come from, where you go" "what you're going to be," read the English, not hard to figure out.
The most important thing is to build a "heroes memorial" in your heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of the revolution, some 20 million martyrs have died heroically for national independence, the liberation of peoples and the strength of their country.
For various reasons, many of the pioneers did not even leave their names.
Countless indignities pour their blood into the ideals, practice their faith with their lives, remember their names and pass on their spirit to protect the roots and souls of nations.
This "hero monument" cannot be tarnished or destroyed.
For some time now, history has sprung up in the shadows of nihilism and general entertainment.
All kinds of distorted and derogatory practices challenge the conscience of justice, distort value judgements and generate public outrage and alarm throughout society.
Insolence cannot be desecrated and heroes must not forget.
Acts that touch the bottom line cannot be allowed to go unheeded, but must be fought with the sword and with justice in accordance with the rule of law.
On 1 May this year, the law on the protection of heroic martyrs was officially implemented.
From the standpoint of judicial practice, a number of cases have been decided with a great deal of interest, both in the effective defence of a shining image in accordance with the law and in the release of a positive energy of heroism and admiration.
A people with aspirations cannot be without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot be without pioneers.
The memory of the vanguard and the call for heroes have become universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities throughout the country, and more than 100 million visits to the Martyrs Manor every year.
The human heart is the strongest building block.
A “hero monument” would be set between the heavens and the earth and deep in the hearts of the people.
Reuters, September 28 - The EU took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday, following Italy’s defiance of EU demands and its surprise at the market’s massive budget deficit plan, but it might take a more radical stance if Italy insists on too ambitious a goal.
The goal of the suspected European government is to have a budget deficit equal to 2.4% of GDP for the next three years, which suggests that debt reduction is still pending in the face of demand for cuts.
“We are not interested in the crisis between the Commission and Italy,” the EU’s Executive Committee on Economic Affairs said on Friday, “because the EU’s proposals and sanctions may have little impact on Italy, he responded cautiously.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before it is formally presented to the EU Executive Committee in mid-October.
After the Government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level for almost two weeks on Friday and the Italian bond return reached its highest level for three weeks.
If the deficit target remained unchanged by the October deadline, the EU ExCom might reject Italy ' s draft budget, something it had never done to any country.
At a meeting in Riga, Latvia’s capital, on Friday, the EU’s Vice-President East Brovsky stated that Italy’s current fiscal plan “does not appear to be in line with the Stability and Growth Pact”, referring to the EU’s financial provisions.
But he did not say how this would trigger the EU’s reaction.
The tenderer may submit an application to participate in this public tender by 26 October this year.
The Russian Ministry of Agriculture had previously identified China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
The Russian Agricultural Supervision Agency announced in May that, for the first time in the current agricultural year, Russian food exports to China exceeded 1 million tons, an innovative record.
The Bureau predicts that China may be among the top 10 Russian food importers.
On September 30, Sapporo, China New Zealand, after winning the Cuban team at 3:0 in the first battle, the Chinese women once again won the Turkish team at 3:0 in 30 days and won the 2018 World Championship.
However, compared to the First World War, Chinese women were more difficult to follow.
A total of 24 teams participated in the 2018 Women's World Series, with Chinese women in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
The Turkish and Italian teams are the main rivals of the Chinese team in terms of their world ranking and overall strength.
When the competition began, the Chinese team moved to a better position, leading the game, maintaining its advantage throughout the process, putting pressure on their opponents to win the first game at 25:18.
The Turkish team in the second round was a tough hit, with a 6:2 lead, and the Chinese team requested a pause and adjusted its formation to a 7-point score, which was then followed by a 7-0 score; the Turkish team at the end of the game, which at one point ran to 15:19; the tenacious Turkish team, which ran a 2-point run after 24:20; and the Chinese team, which once again requested a suspension, managed to score the second round with Joo-Ting's run-off at 25:23.
In the third round, the situation was stymied, with the parties rising in turn, at one time at 19 even.
At a critical time, the Turkish team made a mistake, leading by 21:19, and winning by 24:21 with Chu Ting’s heavy capture and Zhang Chang Ning’s attack; then the Turkish team went after 23:24, after the Chinese team requested a pause, Zhang Zhang Zing Ning scored the score, and the Chinese team locked the game at 25:23.
After the Chinese women ' s coach Zhangping, the whole game was not easy.
“We are better prepared, the net is better, the Turkish team is more comprehensive, and we have to reduce our mistakes and try to win through our own initiative. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In the face of her former familiar teammates, Ju-Ting, who served as the Volkiv Bank in Turkey, was restricted in the first game of the day, after which she took the initiative to change and continued to take a strong offensive.
“It is well known to each other and it is normal to be targeted, but the Chinese team has played its best role in stopping the net and attacking in the face of an uncontrollable rumor. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The Chinese women's platoon will then cease fighting for one day and conduct physical and technical training; on October 2nd, the team will meet the third Canadian team.
On the 30th of September, the China-China Water Network (Chou Chi-Ping Wang Peng) organized a focused project in the Hebei Water High District in late 2018.
Six projects were concentrated on that day, with a total investment of RMB 4.29 billion.
On that day, the Deputy Mayor of Yang Shikun, the Standing Committee of the Water Supply and Sanitation Commission, announced the beginning of work.
According to the Director of the Hebei Water High District Management Committee, Yao Hsiu, the six projects that have been concentrated today, with a total investment of $4.29 billion, are industrial projects, ranging from the transformation of traditional industries to the introduction of new industries, covering various sectors such as civil-military integration, cloud factories, food, medicine, chemical industries, etc., with high technological content, industry level and value added.
It is believed that the construction and commissioning of the project will give a strong impetus to the early realization of the goal of “building hundreds of billions of class industrial parks for the country's highest-level zones”.
The project was announced by Yang Shikun, Deputy Mayor, Standing Committee of the Water Supply and Sanitation Commission.
Yao Hsiu said that the region had successfully launched a series of major events such as the China Waters and Waters International Life Sciences Summit and the Great Health Industry Development Forum, the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology High-end Equipment Industry Accounting and Water Summit, and the “two-synergy” Innovations Forum, with a strong effort to develop new materials energy, greater health, and high-end equipment manufacturing three strategic new industries.
The Central American stem cell project will be officially operational by the end of the year.
The project ' s ton-tonne intermediate test base began with the construction of the country ' s first, the world ' s largest, megawatt-scale supercritical carbon dioxide compressor pilot platform.
An advanced supercentre of computations for the top 10 operators in the world has been re-established in provinces and cities.
Yao Happiness indicated that by the end of the year, the district will have completed the 240,000 m2 major project for Science and Technology Valley, including digital information, new materials for new sources of energy, three research and development bases for life and health and exhibition centres.
An “upgrading” of the “System +” innovation model will be actively developed, and a “one platform for the two houses” will be built, promoting innovation in the integration of scientific and technological results through multidisciplinary cross-cutting, multi-unit collaboration, and multi-industry integration.
Nearly a thousand state-owned view areas have been reduced by more than 20 percent.
[Summary] As of 28 September, 981 viewing areas have been implemented or published for free (74 free and 907 lower prices) and prices have been reduced in such areas as Yunnan Stonelin, Da Lixin, Yulongshan, Guangxi Guilin, Fujian Mu Zhushan, Hunan Zhang Zhang, Shaanxi Jun, Jiangxi Chingshan and Xinjiang Canas.
As part of the follow-up to the Central Economic Work Conference and the deployment of the Report on the Work of the Government, the National Development and Reform Commission issued, on 28 June, its Guidance on Improving the System of Prices for State-owned Landscapes and Reducing Prices for Key State Landscapes (hereinafter referred to as the Guidance), which calls for the improvement of the system of ticket formation for State-owned Landscapes in terms of the rational definition of their cost composition, innovative price management, strict compliance with the pricing procedures, etc., to ensure that by the end of September the high prices for Key State Landscapes are reduced with tangible results.
Local efforts to comply with deployment requirements have resulted in successive reductions in the price of tickets to key State-owned sites.
As of September 28, free opening or reduction measures have been put in place or published for 981 sites (74 free, at a price of 907), of which 159 are in 5A and 534 in 4A, or 70.6 per cent.
Of the 907 scenery areas where prices fell, 491 or 54.3 per cent, or more than 20 per cent, and 214 or 23.6 per cent, or more than 30 per cent.
The provinces of Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi and Shaanxi have a higher number of lower-priced areas, including Yunnan, where the number of lower-priced areas is over 100, with an overall decrease of over 30 per cent.
The eight provinces (districts, municipalities) of Anhui, Chongqing and others have all achieved price reductions in the 5A-rated area.
Price reductions have been introduced in view areas with high social interest, such as Yunnan Stone Forest, Da Lixin Tower, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi Guiryin River, Fujian Wubura Hill, Hunan Zhang's border, Xianxi Private Maung, Jiangxi Chingshan and Xinjiang Canas.
The gradual return of ticket prices in key State-owned landscapes to reasonable areas has helped to accelerate the transition of tourism from a ticket economy to an industrial economy, from small-scale tourism to mass tourism, from attraction tourism to global tourism, and to create a virtuous circle of optimized tourism supply structures and steadily expanding demand for tourism consumption, and to promote sustainable and healthy tourism development.
At the same time, the National Commission for Development and Reform stressed the need to strengthen local regulation of the price order in the landscape, to guide the upgrading of services in the landscape and to ensure that price reductions do not decrease.
In addition, the National Development and Reform Commission has conducted a special inspection of recent media reports on the small and steady decline in ticket prices in individual areas, calling for serious local responses to social concerns and effective implementation of the reduction.
The work of the Trade and Development Board to optimize in the short and long term in an orderly manner
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Agency has submitted short-term and long-term optimization reports on “major investment migrants” and “technological migrants”, which are currently being followed up and followed up by a continuous process of social input and optimization.
The Trade and Development Board will make presentations to all sectors of society as soon as possible on relevant optimization efforts.
Five of them are short-term measures implemented this year; five are medium-term measures implemented in 2019; and one is long-term measures.
In addition, the Trade and Development Board conducted a comprehensive review of the internal management system, as directed by the Director of the Department of Economic and Financial Affairs, Liangwit.
Five short-term measures undertaken during the year include:
1. Undertake a review exercise. Priority is given to reviewing cases that are about to expire seven years ago, cases referred to in ICAC reports, and new extensions. If there are indications of irregularities or violations, they will be referred to the competent judicial authorities for follow-up;
Field visits cover projects involving “significant investment migrants”. By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been visited;
3. Comprehensive review of the evaluation system at present. Six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established with regard to the evaluation of applications for “significant investment migrants”; and the review of applications for “technological migrants” will be improved through the identification of elements conducive to the development of the country and the conditions for the admission of skilled personnel. A list of “Ten jobs in the five sectors” has also been established on an annual basis to prioritize the recruitment of talent in order to better target it in line with the Government's policy direction;
4. Increasing the transparency of information. This includes plans to progressively publish approval guidelines, scoring criteria and weights as of the fourth quarter of this year, and to further refine and make publicly available the data for approval;
5. With regard to the improvement of the validation mechanism, confirmation has been requested for prior verification of work in Australia; major investments are subject to on-site verification and financial statements.
The five medium-term measures implemented in 2019 include:
1. Establishment of a regular mechanism for hearing the views of the Talent Development Commission and the Economic Development Commission. A working meeting with the Economic Development Commission was held in September to discuss the establishment of the mechanism.
2. Requires the applicant to submit annually financial statements prepared by an independent third party to keep under review the operational status of the investment project;
3. Further standardizing and electronicizing case applications and approval processes to reduce human error;
4. A comprehensive review of current staffing levels, in conjunction with the implementation of a number of optimization measures;
5. To intensify the work on the revision of the Temporary Residence System for Investors, Managers and Specially Qualified Technicians.
With regard to long-term measures, it is anticipated that the legislative reform will be stepped up in the first half of 2019, with a view to completing the draft legislation as soon as possible, further clarifying the criteria for granting temporary residence permits, the review mechanism and the validation mechanism, as well as increasing the investigation function of the Trade and Development Board to more precisely approve and supervise applications for temporary residence permits.
The experts of the national non-film cotton field observation and exchange seminar went into the field and heard a presentation by a representative of the team of the Chinese Engineering College of the Sakagi Academy.
On September 30, Sino-Sinjiang Xinjiang (King Tendang Army) electricity was set up in Xinjiang Xaya County at a test base for membrane cotton cultivation, which was popular and “not bad” compared to the membrane cotton next to it, and a white cotton raced “open” with branches.
From 27 to 28 September, a national spot-viewing and workshop exchange of membranes took place in Xinjiang Saya district.
During the workshop, journalists learned of the initial achievement of the objective of membrane-free cotton cultivation in cotton fields and the reduction of the contamination of the ecological environment and the original cotton by the membrane cotton membrane technology system, which is dominated by the “magnetic cotton 619” and its accompanying planting measures, and the significant progress made in the study and demonstration of the integrated membrane cotton technology.
The Chief Scientist of the Cotton System of the State System of Modern Agricultural Industries, a member of the Chinese Engineering College, a well-known cotton genetic breeder, has described the growth of non-film cotton to the Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Agroforestry University Party.
“The integrated technology of membrane cotton, which we have developed, can be fully implemented without membrane cultivation and can completely address the problem of film contamination and achieve green cotton planting. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The Chinese Academy of Engineering has been introduced by the Quaqun.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing area in China, and in 2017, according to the National Statistical Office, Xinjiang cotton cultivation amounted to 35 million acres, or 61 per cent of the country ' s cotton area.
Since the introduction of the membrane in China in 1982, the Xinjiang area has covered more than 50 million acres of crop cover of all types, with an annual membrane use of about 300,000 tons.
Of these, cotton membranes cover 100 per cent and cotton fields cover about 60 per cent of Xinjiang's membrane usage.
The production of membrane cotton is measured, and the production of cotton is fully capable of producing 320 to 350 kg of acre.
With the increasing input of the Xinjiang membrane, the low recovery rate of residual membranes, the gradual increase in the amount of membranes in the soil and the destruction of the soil structure caused by the membranes, there are a number of problems that seriously affect sustainable agricultural development.
Not only do the membranes cause serious soil contamination, they also have a significant impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
At present, over one third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang cotton harvests covered approximately 14 million acres.
Large amounts of ground surfaces and shredded membranes of cotton are collected during the process of cotton harvesting, which is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton and cannot be completely removed during subsequent textile processing, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On 28 September, a national live sighting and workshop exchange of membrane cotton was held in Xinjiang Saya district.
In an effort to tackle the pollution of cotton fields, to streamline cotton-planting techniques and to improve the efficiency of cotton fields, it is understood that the trees led his team through eight years to implement the “moderate 619” membrane cotton plant and “swings” for green development in Xinjiang agriculture.
The paraphrasing tree is a quick introduction to the “middle cotton 619” new land-based cotton line, which is pre-maturized, saline-resistant, low-temperature and productive, through innovative new ideas for breeding.
“`Medical cotton 619', under the conditions of membrane cultivation in the southern part of Xinjiang, has been accompanied by a series of measures such as membrane seeding machines, in-depth seeding improvement, shallow burial of drip pipes under membrane conditions, suitable seed density screening, and sound chemical regulation. It's not like it's a bad idea.
At present, demonstration sites for membrane cotton have been established in Aksu, Kulle and Aral, with a production of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Cultivation of cotton without membrane results in production, conservation and environmental protection, with combined benefits.
Zhang Danghai, a farmer at the third division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that, through nearly six years of research and demonstration of membrane-free cotton cultivation techniques, the production of membrane cotton could well be 320 to 350 kg of acre production, possibly even higher.
“The diffusion of membrane cotton cultivation technology is promising. It's not like we're going anywhere.
While Zhang Tonghai believes that current technology for membrane cotton cultivation can completely address the problem of soil residual pollution, there is still a gap between the economic benefits of membrane cultivation.
“The support of cotton acquisition prices will facilitate future expansion. It's not like we're going anywhere.
Paradoxically, next steps, he and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and extensive extension of the membrane cotton industry, with a view to overcoming the soil pollution caused by the membrane.
Guangdong Sea, Sea and Air responded positively to the National Day Gold Week transport - China New Network
On 29 September, the seventh day of official traffic in the high-level Hong Kong section and the first weekend since the opening, the West Kowloon station has had its head boosted.
On the eve of the National Day of Gold Week (1-7 October), journalists have learned from the relevant authorities that the transport departments of Guangdong Railway, Air, Water and Roads are actively planning to increase their capacity to ship and put in place safeguards to ensure the safe and orderly transport of passengers within their borders during the Golden Week.
China Railways Guangzhou Bureau Group Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Gang Iron Group”) During this year ' s National Golden Week, the Guangting Group is expected to transport 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 1.55,000 over the same period, or 9.2 per cent.
In order to meet the travel needs of passengers, the Guangdong Group plans to open 104 high-terrestrial trains and 85 high-speed trains, focusing mainly on hot lines such as Kyoto, Yonggun, Guangdong and Hanging-Deep Iron.
Guangzhou's White Cloud Airport, which will be the busiest airport in the interior this year, is expected to receive more than 1.4 million passengers and to fly over 9,200 flights.
With the increasing number of international routes, the airport is expected to see a significant increase in international passengers over the past year, a significant feature of this year ' s golden week holidays.
Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Jakarta, Colombo, Maldives, Manila, etc. are known to be hot cities for this year's national holiday, and tourist attractions such as Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur, Bali and others continue to explode, with some flights “hard to get one vote”.
Some airlines have specifically increased the number of operating classes, such as Shenzhen Air, with one additional Guangzhou-Hanoi flight per day, and Iran's Mahan Air, with one additional Guangzhou per Saturday. Tehran flight; Viet Nam Viet Nam Expedition Air is adding one flight per week to Guangzhou-Hanoi flight.
In order to ensure holiday security, White Cloud Airport has increased the level of key job security, such as “space allocation” and “cargo security” and “passenger security” services, and is prepared for the large delays in the disposal of flights.
According to China South Airlines, the route to the Austro-Sino-American, North American and Japanese regions this year is very hot, and flights to China-China destinations such as Hainan, Chengdu, Chuzhou, Mount Nine Hua, Sadak, Huangshan, etc.
There were 50 additional flights during the Golden Week of the South, including 10 additional flights on the Chiang Mai route from Guangzhou.
According to the Guangdong Maritime Authority, security screening operations were carried out prior to the festival on key vessels, such as a water cruise ship, a passenger ferry in the Straits of Jonglei State, a high-speed passenger ship at the Pearl River Pass and a ferry, to ensure that the safety of water traffic was stabilized during long vacations.
During the Golden Week, traffic in Guangdong Province is expected to be at the top of the Chinese list.
The Guangdong Transport Group has recently issued a holiday highway travel guide, which is expected to increase by about 12 per cent.
The Superintendence of Market Supervision recently issued a Circular on Strengthening Market Price Regulation during the National Day of the Mid-Autumn in 2018, which called for the strengthening of price regulation in the area of rental and real estate, the strict regulation of rent price collusion, the accumulation of rental sources, the fabrication of false information to raise rents, the indiscriminate charging of fees by binding services, the publication of misleading price information, the publication of uncoded prices, etc.
The circular made it clear that price monitoring early warning should be enhanced and that market price developments should be closely followed.
There is a need to monitor and analyse price monitoring and early warning by paying close attention to the basic necessities of life, such as food and meat, egg and egg salt, and to changes in the markets and prices of special commodities consumed by the local population during their holidays.
In the event that market volatility is detected, timely and effective measures are taken to address it.
There is a need to strengthen the monitoring and inspection of the wholesale and retail distribution of essential goods, to increase the frequency and regulation of places closely related to the daily consumption of the population, such as supermarkets and agricultural markets, and to ensure that operators operate in good faith and in compliance with the law.
The circular stated that it was necessary to strengthen the inspection of priority areas and create a good consumer environment; to strengthen the regulation of the prices of tickets in state-owned view areas; to focus on violations such as non-compliance with government price levels or floating ranges in state-owned view areas; to increase the price of tickets by means of unauthorized additions to fees; to increase the price of tickets by means of irregular “garden” tickets; to impose high pricing discounts; to bind sales; to de-codify prices; to refrain from implementing preferential measures; to add prices; and to impose surrogate charges.
The notification requirement is to strengthen the regulation of prices of essential goods, especially agricultural products.
In recent times, prices of essential agricultural products, such as vegetables and pork, have fluctuated in some areas, influenced by seasonal variations, natural disasters and outbreaks.
Locally, the market price regulation of agricultural by-products must be strengthened, the production and market supply must be stabilized, and efforts must be made to conduct market-focused and random inspections.
Increased frequency of inspections of commodities such as hard-to-supply and fast-priced pork and serious violations such as hoarding of surprises, price hikes and collusive price hikes.
The circular states that price regulation in the areas of rental housing and real estate needs to be strengthened.
In mid-Autumn, the National Day coincides with the booming season in the sale of housing rentals and goods, with close attention to the price behaviour of real estate enterprises, intermediaries and housing rental-related enterprises, the strict regulation of rent-price collusion, the accumulation of rental sources, the fabrication of false information to raise rents, the indiscriminate charging of fees in the form of tied services, the publication of misleading price information, the issuance of undefined price tags, etc., and the intensification of the inspection of price marks in the sale of hot and selling buildings and housing intermediaries, as well as the detection of non-compliance with the required “one set” to the detriment of consumers and disrupt market order, the purification of the housing market environment and the creation of an open and transparent order of prices in the real estate market.
The circular refers to the effective regulation of prices in other segments of the tourism industry, which is aimed at regulating the price order of restaurants, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, entertainment, parking, etc., and at directing operators to mark prices, billing and advertising, and seriously investigating and prosecuting all types of price violations.
The circular stated that the inspection of transport prices, such as roads, railways, civil aviation and water transport, should be strengthened and that violations such as price increases, extra-price charges and non-specified prices should be seriously investigated.
Implementation of the “green corridor” for the transportation of fresh agricultural products and exemption from minibus tolls for major holidays.
Innovative regulatory instruments and working methods are needed to increase the dissemination of price laws and regulations for offline and offline retailing enterprises and e-commerce platforms, to urge operators to improve their price promotion programmes and to investigate, in accordance with the law, violations such as fictitious prices, misleading price indications and non-compliance with price commitments.
Journalists were informed on 1 January that the 15-year anniversary of the Zhong Hong Kong train had been completed three times, and that traffic had so far increased; the cumulative total of passengers transported to and from Zhong Hong Kong had exceeded 1.7 million.
At the same time, Hong Kong/Australia passenger clearance does not exceed 15 seconds.
On 1 October 2003, the State Council approved the establishment of the Shanghai-Kowloon direct-traffic port, which is the first passenger port in China for long-distance rail traffic to Hong Kong, marking the opening of Shanghai's ports of water, air and land “three-wing flights”.
To date, the train has been in operation for 15 years.
On 1st day of the Shanghai Railway Border Control, which was assigned to the border control of the entry and exit of the port, it was revealed that, since its opening, the train has been boosted three times, from nearly 30 hours to 19 hours per trip; that the average annual traffic of passengers arriving and departing from the port increased from less than 80,000 to more than 150,000 times; and that, over the past 15 years, the total number of passengers transporting to and from the port of entry and exit from the port has exceeded 1.7 million times.
According to the information received, for 15 years, a police coordination mechanism has been signed between the Shanghai Railway border crossing point and the Nine Trains along the road, and police officers have been assigned to carry out on-the-car surveillance, resulting in full coverage of services and controls in 1991.
Over the past 15 years, the Shanghai Railways Border Post has detected nearly a thousand cases of various violations and has been successful in detecting cases of illegal entry of foreigners with false permits and leaving the country under false names.
The station has also established mechanisms such as working exchanges with the Joint Inspection Unit (JCU), conducted regular intensive training exercises at the Integrated Counter-Terrorism Service at the railway ports, conducted joint anti-terrestrial operations, and constructed a “third-level moat” protective belt at the railway ports.
Over the past 15 years, the Shanghai Railways Border Control Service has been known to be constantly innovative in its services, and the speed of customs clearance has increased significantly.
The Border Post has also set up a volunteer service group called Qinglan to provide caring assistance to the elderly, pregnant women and passengers carrying babies.
On 30 March, journalists learned from the Ministry of Finance that the Ministry of Finance, the National Tax Administration, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce had recently issued a joint circular to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, to allocate profits to foreign investors from enterprises in China, to suspend the application of the income tax policy for domestic direct investment, and to extend the foreign investment incentive scheme to all projects and areas not prohibited from foreign investment.
This policy has been in force since 1 January 2018.
It is clear from the circular that foreign investors ' direct investments on a profit-sharing basis include equity investment by offshore investors on a profit-sharing basis, such as refinancing, new construction and equity acquisitions, but do not include new, additional and acquired shares of listed companies in addition to eligible strategic investments.
If an offshore investor is entitled to a policy of withholding an advance income tax but is not actually entitled to it, he or she may apply for recovery of the policy within three years of the date on which the relevant tax is actually paid and refund the tax paid.
Moreover, foreign investors may continue to benefit from a moratorium on income tax policies if the reorganization of the enterprise into which they are invested meets the requirements of speciality and is actually taxed in accordance with speciality.
In order to ensure that profits from foreign investors are actually used for direct investments, the circular provides that the profits from foreign investors are paid in cash, that the funds are transferred directly from the account of the profit-allocation enterprise to the account of the investing enterprise or equity transferor and may not be made available to other accounts, whether internal or external, prior to direct investment; that the profits from foreign investors for direct investments are paid in non-cash form, such as in-kind, marketable securities, and that the ownership of the assets in question is transferred directly from the profit-allocation enterprise to the enterprise or equity transferor to which the investment is made, and that no other business, person, may hold or temporarily hold the direct investment.
The circular also requires tax authorities to strengthen follow-up regulation in accordance with the law.
If an offshore investor has been granted a moratorium on the imposition of an advance income tax policy and has been certified by the tax authorities as non-conforming by subsequent administration, it is considered that, with the exception of the liability of the profit-allocation company, the foreign investor has failed to declare the enterprise income tax in accordance with the requirements, and will be held liable under the law for the delay in paying the tax, which is calculated from the date the relevant profits are paid.
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated on Friday that it would no longer be permitted to import raw materials produced by the China Sea pharmaceutical industry and to use preparations made by the company.
A drug previously produced by the Chinese medicine industry was recalled for containing potentially carcinogenic substances.
The European Medical Authority indicated that further action was being considered for the other components produced by the plant.
According to FDA, major production process problems were identified during FDA ' s inspection of pharmaceutical plants in the China Sea Pharmacy industry and subsequently stopped imports.
FDA further states that imports will be banned until the Chinese Sea Pharmacy industry discovers how the aforementioned impurities were produced and improves its quality control system.
On September 29, China’s pharmaceutical industry released a statement on the company’s website saying: “The company is taking a proactive and vigorous step to overhaul the problems in this US-European official inspection; it is very surprised and sorry about the way in which the US-European official handled it and the results.
Companies are concerned about this in the current complex market environment.
Currently, companies are organizing teams, including professional lawyers, to communicate and file complaints with United States and European Union officials in accordance with the relevant procedures, in order to resume production as soon as possible. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Reuters Shanghai 29 September - The CSRC announced Friday evening that the CSRC had approved the initial application for China People ' s Insurance Group Inc. (IPO) in accordance with the legal procedure.
However, the CVM's official Twitter public number did not disclose the size of the IPO fund-raising exercise.
As early as 29 September last year, the Chinese People's Insurance Society (1339.HK) submitted an application to the CSRC for the issuance of up to 4,599 million shares of Unit A, with plans to be placed on the market.
According to pre-disclosed material previously published by the SEC, the company’s current application for new shares does not exceed 9.78 per cent of the total equity stock after the issuance, and does not include any shares that may be issued under the option of oversale.
The collection of funds will be used to enrich corporate capital.
On 9 April of this year, the CVM published a statement (declaration) of the Chinese People's Security admission.
The statement of claim indicates that prior to the issuance of Unit A, the Chinese people ' s gross equity was 42.42 billion, assuming that the current issue of Unit A was 4,599 million and did not exercise the option of oversale, and that, following the issuance of Unit A, the total equity of the Group did not exceed 47,023 million, of which no more than 38,296 million were in Unit A and 8,726 million in Unit H.
On 5 June, the Chinese PIPO applied to pass the CDO.
As of 31 December 2017, the Ministry of Finance held 70.47 per cent of the Chinese gross equity, while the Social Security Foundation held 10.2 per cent.
The share of the Treasury will be diluted to 63.58%, and the share of the Social Security Foundation will be 9.2%.
As of Friday this week, the Chinese Pao H stock collection stood at HK$3.52, an increase of 1.44 per cent that day.
Former foreign aid charges for playing a fake ball.
Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Holding Football Club (hereinafter referred to as Northern Control) responded officially to the team ' s former foreign aid, Anachebe, accusing the team of playing fake football. The North Control issued a statement stating that there was absolutely no playing false football at the club, which was entirely a fabrication made by Anachebe himself during the arbitration process in order to cover up his flagrant violation of the contract and for his own improper economic purposes.
At the same time, the North Control indicated that it would reserve the right to hold the parties concerned accountable by all means available.
According to the British Daily Mail, Nigerian football player Anachebe complained to FIFA that his Beijing North Control team, which served last year, was suspected of playing fake football, including Beijing Derby in Round 21 of the 2017 round.
It was the critical phase of the Beijing people and the rush, when the game ended in a zero-to-two game compared to the Beijing people and Anacheby.
An official response was made yesterday to the story of the Nigerian player at the North Control Club.
The statement stated that, as a result of an internal survey conducted prior to the club, there had been no false play in the competitions attended by teams.
In June 2017, Anachebe joined the Beijing North, and in December of the same year Anachebe refused to return to winter training without justification, despite repeated calls from the club.
Currently, disputes between the parties have been referred to FIFA and arbitration is ongoing.
The statement also mentioned that the “false ball allegations” of concern were in fact lies fabricated by Anichebe during the arbitration process in order to cover up his flagrant violation of the contract agreement and for his own improper economic purposes.
Its sole purpose was to discredit clubs and Chinese football for unjust economic gain.
Clubs do not accept any organizations or individuals who, for their economic interests and in the interest of private individuals, engage in unprovoked accusations, defamation, slander and defamation of clubs.
Thus, the Northern side indicated that it would reserve the right to hold the parties concerned accountable by all means available.
The China Bank for Agricultural Development will invest 20 billion yuan to support the purchase of Jilin ' s food.
Since September, crops have continued to peak in the Jilin province.
Journalists learned from the Jilin provincial branch of the China Bank for Agricultural Development that 20 billion yuan in credit funds are currently available for agricultural distribution to ensure adequate funding for the purchase of Jilin ' s food.
It is understood that the food production situation in Jilin has been generally stable this year, with some food-processing enterprises increasing demand in the food market as a result of increased capacity and start-up rates.
In order to ensure the availability of funds for food policy purchases, agricultural distributions have been actively engaged in the Autumn Food Acquisitions and Silver Exchanges by visiting various purchasers, such as farmers, processing enterprises and trading enterprises.
At present, $5.2 billion has been invested in agricultural issuances to support the purchase of 1,58 billion pounds of autumn grain by various food purchasers.
One hundred and twenty major food purchasers have located nearly 300 acquisition sites in Jilin province to ensure “full coverage” of the main food-producing districts, leaving no “gaps” for acquisition funds.
The relevant director of agricultural issuances indicated that, depending on the pace of acquisition and the demand for business money, if the scale of the acquisition is insufficient, the issuance of agricultural products will be supplemented by a loan of $20 billion to ensure the timely and full supply of funds, maintain stability in the food market and protect the interests of farmers.
Chinese journalists will be taken away by the police in the British Conservative Party year.
According to information from the web site of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, the spokesman for the Embassy in the United Kingdom asked questions on 1 January about the fact that a Chinese journalist had been taken away by the police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party.
He called on the Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party to cease its interference in China ' s internal affairs and its involvement in Hong Kong, and requested the organizers to apologize to the Chinese journalists.
Journalists asked that on 30 September, during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party, the party ' s Human Rights Committee held a side event on Hong Kong and invited the Hong Kong opposition to speak.
A Chinese journalist was taken away by the police during the event.
Do you have any comments?
In response, he said that, in the 21 years since Hong Kong's return to Hong Kong, the practice of “one country, two systems” had been a great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements had been universally recognized.
Hong Kong is Hong Kong of China, and Hong Kong's affairs are purely internal Chinese affairs.
The Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party has used its annual meetings to organize side events to raise awareness of the anti-China separatist forces, and China expresses its grave concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We strongly oppose any interference by any organization in Hong Kong in any way.
Any attempt or action to promote “the independence of Hong Kong” is futile.
It was totally unacceptable that, while the United Kingdom had consistently promoted freedom of expression, when Chinese journalists had asked questions at a side event to express their views, they had been prevented from doing so, even physically.
We demand that the Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party cease its interference in China ' s internal affairs, cease its involvement in Hong Kong, and that the organizers of the conference apologize to Chinese journalists.

The Microsoft Small Ice, pioneered by Microsoft’s Chinese research and development team, has now landed in China, Japan, the United States, India, Indonesia and other countries, serving as television anchors, radio anchors, singers, etc. China’s development of Internet technology has frequently flashed into the world’s technological frontier, attracting surprises from around the world and becoming a global hub and windbeam for top Internet technology.
A new platform for technology exchange at the Internet Light Fair
As one of the key elements of the World Internet Congress, the Internet Light fair drives the interactive exchange of global Internet science, technology and innovation outcomes, creating an important platform for Internet businesses to show up-to-date results.
The Internet Light Fair showcases new Internet products, new technologies, new applications, with different subject areas and functional blocks, and selects globally recognized Internet enterprises and innovative ones by different technology categories, bringing together cutting-edge results and displaying innovative technologies that reflect the civilizational light of Internet communication, the light of the future and the light of the world.
Taking as an example the fourth World Internet Congress “The Light of the Internet” Expo, which attracted 411 prominent domestic and foreign businesses from around the world, the latest results of global Internet technology and applications innovation and digital economic development, including cloud computing, networking, artificial intelligence, highlighted the features of global vision, innovation-driven and open cooperation.
More than 110 new technology launch events on new products and 10 thematic interfaces on Internet project cooperation during the Conference provided a broad platform for global digital economic cooperation.
A paper-based test paper, scanned through a mobile phone or tablet computer, can immediately identify content and distribute points; a half-metre-high unmanned car carrying cargo can independently complete a quick delivery; a smart home can achieve voice shopping, mobile phone filling, call for take-off, music broadcasting alone, and a central display of the best Internet technological achievements at the Internet Light fair has become a global beacon for the development of the science and technology industry and the Internet, creating a new platform for sharing the latest results.
Internet science and technology for people
The innovative development driven by Internet technology is ultimately aimed at creating a better future for the peoples of the world and at creating a more equitable, open and inclusive environment for the well-being of humankind, economic development and well-being of society.
In a large Internet country like China, with a large user base, Internet technology has a strong magnification effect in specific applications.
For example, China's Beidou provides users with high-precision, reliable positioning, speed measurement and timing services, along with unique short-copy communication capabilities; the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, which has a remodelling function for traditional industries, promotes industry progress and plays an active role in many areas, such as finance, transport, health and safety; and the help of Earth-to-ground communications technology in effectively addressing the problem of Internet access for aircraft and high iron and other means of transport, improving users' access experience.
According to the forty-second Statistical Report on the Development of the Internet in China, published by the China Internet Information Centre, China, as the largest Internet market worldwide, is promoting progress in social development through a digital process.
The dividends of Internet technology development are by no means limited to China, but its results are also a powerful driving force for the development of the Internet worldwide, and indeed of the economy and society.
For example, China’s cross-border electricians and shared economies abroad are increasingly supporting world economic growth; China’s new generation of information technologies, such as cloud computing, big data, physical networking and mobile Internet, accelerates the deepening of the global industrial division of labour and economic restructuring to reshape global economic competition patterns.
Sharing the benefits of cyberdevelopment, as outlined in the U-town Initiative launched at the Second World Internet Congress, leading to the early formation of a global network market to create more jobs will provide a strong underpinning for sustained and healthy development of the global economy and will allow more countries and peoples to take advantage of the information age.

We're going to see the flag-raising ceremony on the Fourth of July! It's not like we're going anywhere.
On the morning of October 1st, Mr. and Mrs. Song, who had deliberately flown from Ningxia to Shenzhen and were travelling on the first bus of the Guang Dynasty Highway National Day in Shenzhen, were interviewed by the Chinese news agency at the West Kowloon station in Hong Kong.
On the morning of 1 October, in celebration of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a high flag raising ceremony at the Golden Purple Square.
According to statistics from the immigration control station, as at 30 September, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the High Teeth Kowloon station exceeded 300,000.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the birth of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Post expects a peak in visitor visits on 1 and 2 October.
At about 7 a.m. a.m., journalists arrived in Hong Kong Hall and a large number of tourists from the Mainland took advantage of the National Golden Week to catch high iron and swim to Hong Kong.
Mrs. Song, with her modest feet, told the journalists that the national holiday was a long holiday of a year and that it was her long-standing wish to come to Hong Kong to see the flag raised at Golden and Purple Square, and that she was particularly happy and excited to achieve that wish on the national day.
However, it is difficult to travel between Ningxia and Hong Kong at this time, so that we can travel to Hong Kong in high iron Hong Kong. Mr. Song, after checking the train schedule, found that the first bus arrived at 7.03 a.m. and that the city's means of transport would be taken to Golden Purple Square.
He lamented with the reporters: "The high iron is so convenient, fast and on time! It's not like it's a bad idea.
The 70-hour short-distance trains that travel to and from Guangzhou, Shenzhen North and Fukuda and West Kowloon on a daily basis have greatly facilitated the entry of residents of the Bay of Hong Kong.
When Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, arrived in Hong Kong, he was planning to go to Hong Kong to meet his Hong Kong friend at the top of the Central Ring Mountain.
Mr. Liu said, "We're going to challenge ourselves on holiday in the Mainland and Hong Kong on the Fourth of July to see if we can finish 50 km of Hong Kong Island! It's not like it's a bad idea.
He explained that they would not be able to attempt such long distances without high iron openings, easy access and sufficient time.
Mrs. Yang from Dong Chong came to Hong Kong with her 10-year-old son on top of top iron to play the piano, and she proudly told journalists that it was interesting for her son to spend three years studying the piano in this way.
She had come to Hong Kong on a bus, but it was time-consuming, and she was worried about affecting her son's state, and this time she came to Shenzhen with high iron to facilitate customs clearance and halve the time spent, and she was impressed by the Hong Kong leg of the journey, where she said to the press, “It's like taking the subway, so fast, I didn't have time to photograph!” It's not like it's a bad idea.
On 23 September, at 6.44 a.m., the G5711 High Iron Train departed from Shenzhen North Station and strutted along the way, entering the Hong Kong section of the Guang Dynasty. This was the first officially opened train in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong, which is integrated into the country's 25,000-kilometre high-speed rail network and reaches 38 long-distance stations across the country, also hosts inland tourists from different provinces in North and South China.
Mr. Gao, who visited his family from Changsha Hong Kong on short leave, said to journalists that it had previously been possible to sit in Shenzhen North, take the subway to Hong Kong and then move the city ' s transport, and, in exchange for trouble and time, to sit directly at Kowloon Centre, where he could enjoy his children ' s lunch.
He stated that the “one-stop two-check” clearance procedure was more convenient than could have been imagined, “within 10 minutes, both levels passed”. It's not like it's a bad idea.
West Kowloon Station, which is close to the airport speed line and connects land and air traffic, has also become the preferred destination for many transit passengers.
Ms. Wu from Fujian is going to spend Gold Week with her girlfriends from Hong Kong to the Philippines, where she pushed her luggage out of the West Kowloon gate and said to the reporters without a scratch: "I was afraid I'd miss the plane. I didn't think it would be too soon. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The new United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, published on Monday, will retain the ability of United States President Tripp to implement the 25 per cent tariff threat to imported cars, while at the same time exempting passenger vehicles, pickup cards and car parts imported from Canada and Mexico from paying customs duties.
If Trump imposed so-called “Chapter 232” tariffs on cars for reasons of national security, Mexico and Canada would both have an annual quota of 2.6 million exempt cars exported to the United States.
Under the subsidiary arrangement, the cards produced in both countries would receive full tariff exemption.
If the motor vehicle tariff is imposed, Mexico will receive a tax exemption of $108 billion per year for auto parts and Canada will receive a $32.4 billion quota.
Both quotas are much higher than the current levels of production in both countries and provide a space for growth in their exports.
Reuters Washington/Mexico, 28 September - Mexico Friday stated that, after several days of debate, the Government of United States President Trump and Canada were making concrete efforts to resolve trade policy differences and that it was hoped that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would maintain the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of detail, the obvious progress mentioned above was sufficient to prompt the Governments of Mexico and the United States to stop suddenly their plans to publish the texts of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to accede to it.
Mexican President-designate Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador has stated to journalists in Mexico that the United States Government has put forward new counter-proposals against the Government of Canada and that he will continue to press for the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
Mexico's Minister of the Economy, Ildefonso Guajardo, stated that the submission of the text of the United States-Mexican trade agreement to Mexican and United States legislation had been delayed because the Governments of Canada and the United States had tried “very seriously” to reach an agreement.
According to Guahardo, “In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a tripartite agreement or have to publish it. It's not like it's a bad idea.
According to Guaaldo, his United States and Canadian counterparts “specially requested” to delay the publication of the text.
The spokesperson for the United States Office of Trade Representatives (USTR) did not comment on the text of the United States-Mexican trade agreement and on the United States-Canada consultations.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Foreign Minister of Canada did not respond to requests for comments on counter-recommendations.
According to foreign media reports, two small lions play together in a childcare centre on the outskirts of the South African capital, Pretoria, and it is difficult to see any anomalies, although they are virtually unique.
The University of Pretoria declared: "This is the first young lion ever born by artificial insemination - the first pair in the world. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In-school scientists are working on the reproductive system of the mother African lion.
According to Ganswint, Director of the Institute of Mammals of the University of Pretoria, the two young lions, one female and one female, born on 25 August, are healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally achieved this breakthrough.
During a media interview, Ganswint said: "We collect sperm from a healthy lion. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Next, an artificial insemination is performed on a female lion, such as a researcher, when the hormone levels in her body are appropriate.
Ganswint says: "Fatefully, the result was successful. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He said that the researchers had made “a number of attempts, but unexpectedly they had not spent much effort”.
He indicated that the above-mentioned breakthroughs could be replicated and that scientists wished to use the technology to save endangered large cat animals.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions have been extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of surviving wild lions has fallen by 43 per cent over the past 20 years, leaving only 20,000.
African lions are classified by this organization as vulnerable animals.
Ganswint said, "If we don't do something for this animal, they'll face extinction. It's not like it's a bad idea.
He stated that the new technology did not require the feeding of lions, but rather the injection of sperm into a gestationary lion, as had been done for elephants in North America and Europe.
South Korea experienced the largest decline in exports in more than two years in September, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer days of work and stated that global demand for South Korea's commodities remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea increased exports on average last month.
In addition, the earlier release of opening data showed a double-digit increase in exports in the first weeks of September prior to extended vacation.
South Korea ' s exports declined by the largest year since July 2016, larger than the projected 5.7 per cent decline estimated by 11 Reuters analysts.
The opening values published on Monday show exports at $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea’s exports to China grew by 7.8 per cent in September, and expanded for the twenty-third consecutive month, despite the fact that a growing US-China trade dispute could cause other export-dependent neighbours to suffer.
South Korean exports to the United States declined by 11.8 per cent, owing to a decline in oil sales.
Korea’s memory chips and petroleum products have grown by 28.3 per cent and 13.5 per cent overseas, respectively, although the market’s concern that the so-called “super-cycle” of chips may have peaked.
“The impact of trade conflicts will, however, be inevitable, as South Korea's exports depend heavily on the United States and Chinese markets. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Imports declined by 2.1 per cent to $40.8 billion, or 3.1 per cent as estimated by the Reuters survey.
The trade surplus was at the beginning of $9.7 billion in September, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, thanks to the United States and European Union countries, the global manufacturing industry will remain buoyant, which is a positive factor for South Korean exports.
According to the statement, “Increased export prices resulting from higher oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year. It's not like it's a bad idea.
“But the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, combined with increased market volatility following higher interest rates in the United States, is a negative pressure on exports. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Exports increased to an average of $2.6 billion per working day in September and $2.1 billion in August.
Korea fell from 24 to 26 September in mid-autumn this year, leaving 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
Korea ' s exports from January to September grew by 4.7 per cent over the same period last year.
According to the Japanese/Marketit procurement manager index, South Korean manufacturing activity rebounded in September, but was supported by domestic orders, which had fallen from China and Japan, threatening to cast a shadow over other export prospects.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not relaxing its sanctions against the DPRK.
The Korean Labour News published a review article on 30 September criticizing the United States for not relaxing sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea while seeking dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, calling it a “contrary” practice.
According to the article, United States Secretary of State Pompeyo declared on 14 December that “the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the implementation of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea”, stressing that the position of the United States to continue to implement United Nations sanctions resolutions remains unchanged.
In the joint Singapore-United States statement, both sides committed themselves to building a new inter-Korean relationship that was commensurate with the aspirations of the two peoples for peace and prosperity.
There is no doubt that the United States is ambivalent when it increases the pressure on sanctions and calls for dialogue.
The article states that building confidence should be at the forefront, starting with what can be done, in a phased manner, if a new inter-Korean relationship is to be established, a permanently consolidated peace regime built on the Korean peninsula and the Korean peninsula completely denuclearized.
The article added that the United States should understand that sanctions would not work for the DPRK.
According to the article, even the North Devansk before Kazan was a compliment to the United States military.
The National Interest magazine quotes the United States Navy as saying, "We'll meet a strong potential opponent. Just look at the North Devansk. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The current commander-in-chief of the United States Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the North Devansk.
He said, “This submarine is impressive. Looking at the development of the Russian Navy and how it uses its resources, it is clear that its main efforts in research and development are, first and foremost, to strengthen its submarine fleet. It's not like it's a bad idea.
However, the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
Fogo said: “I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The Russian Navy was previously informed that it would be loading the Kasan submarine in 2019.
The Kazan, Nueva Siberian, Krasnoyarsk, and Alhangelsk multi-purpose submarines are all “white wax tree-M” improvements with a discharge of 13,800 tons, depths down 520 metres, a staffing capacity of 64 people and speeds of 31 knots, carrying torpedoes, torpedoes and “caliber” and “Marknow” cruise missiles.
On September 29, the Newkyo Radio and Television Department published a Circular on the Special Management of Radio and Television Advertising, which began at the end of this year.
These include advertising for low content, etiquette and low taste, and the broadcasting of health-care birthing programmes on issues that are not documented.
According to the circular, the focus of this special intervention is on nine areas.
These include: advertisements with orientation problems; advertisements with low content, ethos and low tastes; advertisements with excess time and irregular distribution problems; advertisements with exaggerated false propaganda, misleading audiences or programme-form appearances, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, health-care foods, cosmetics, beauty products, etc.; medical birthing programmes with unrecorded management problems; advertisements with expected return on investment, such as exaggerated false propaganda, misleading audiences, soliciting for fraud, investment funds, collections, etc.; advertisements that induce minors to behave badly or create undesirable values that undermine the physical and mental health of minors; advertisements that do not meet the requirements when public service announcements are broadcast; advertisements that do not meet the requirements; advertisements with inadequate advertising systems, censorship and accountability; and advertisements with other irregularities.
This overhaul will cover all parts of the country, and the requirements of the overhaul and regulation will be fully implemented at all levels of the broadcast media, frequency of channels, programmes and time periods.
The circular requires that all types of illegal advertisements detected in the supervision and inspection of the various branches of the radio and television administration be dealt with in strict conformity with the General Directorate ' s " Procedure for Infringement of Radio and Television Broadcasting Agencies " .
Serious violations are dealt with in a serious manner, such as cautionary statements, the notification of criticism, the suspension of advertising until the frequency channel is suspended, and public exposure to the public, as appropriate.
In recent years, the General Directorate of Radio and Television has repeatedly called for the suspension of illegal advertising.
This year, the National Radio and Television Authority issued a public announcement calling for the suspension of serious irregularities such as “0-buffle milk” and “Sava cocktails” and “Bonritt plant protection from breeding appearances.”
The General Authority for Radio and Television has prepared a number of regulations and circulars regulating the broadcasting of advertisements on radio and television.
The Circular on Further Strengthening the Administration of Television Shopping Advertisements for the Broadcasting of the Veterans Video Channel stipulates that short television Shopping Advertisements may not be broadcast on the VAT channels at 18 to 24 hours a day.
In other times, short television shopping advertisements may not be broadcast by facilitators, or by “selling” exaggerating sound, tone, action, etc., or by “orthopaedic”, “plastic”, “fat” or “slip” propaganda or disguised promotion of breast-rich and fattening products, with no more than one (sub) short television shopping advertisement per hour per day and no more than three minutes each.
The Circular on Further Strengthening the Management of Radio and Television Advertisements provides that television stations must comply strictly with General Directorate ' s Order No. 61 when broadcasting advertisements in the middle of a film show: two commercial advertisements per episode of non-golden time (in 45 minutes) of not more than 1 minute and not more than 30 seconds per episode; one commercial advertisement per concentration of gold time (1990-2100) of not more than one minute; and a reminder of the duration of the advertisement should be given when advertising.
The circular also stipulates that radio and television broadcasters are strictly required to verify the qualifications, certifications, etc. of health-related information advertisements, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, and health-care foodstuffs, and that the broadcasting of sex-related advertisements is strictly prohibited.
In order to regulate the form of health information advertising, it is not permitted to publish disguised advertisements in the form of health information features.
Health information features should focus on scientific knowledge, such as disease prevention, control and treatment, and should not contain advertising about medicine, medicines, medical devices, health-care foods, and should not be documented on behalf of patients and doctors, pharmacists, specialists, etc.
Manturov said: “For the first time, we have adapted the format of the MAKS international aerospace salon. We recommend China as the principal guest country. Chinese colleagues agreed and accepted our invitation. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Recently, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the Fourth Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Putin.
This was his first appearance at the Forum.
Ignoring American threats!
EU or will enter into a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The United States Government had earlier declared that a new round of sanctions against Iran would be resumed in November and had even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
However, United States allies do not seem to listen.
According to the United States New York Times, during a visit to Iran's Foreign Minister, Zarif, on 29 September, it was revealed that Tehran was close to an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite the United States threat to sanction any country doing business with Iran.
The core purpose of the agreement was to attempt to create a new payment mechanism, i.e. to replace United States dollar transactions by barter or local currency valuation.
The purpose of the methodology was to try to bypass the United States and prevent it from obstructing financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to facilitating the agreement, some French and British officials are concerned that, if the agreement were to materialize, it would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States, which opposes the withdrawal of the United States from the nuclear deal.
According to the media, Zarif's words sound more optimistic than in recent months during an hour of interviews.
Because the agreement has the capacity to “separate” America's traditional allies and effectively break with its attempts to cut Iran's revenues.
“This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit from it.” According to Zarif, States have the legitimate right to trade with Iran, as agreed in 2015.
The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, also said earlier: “No sovereign country or organization can accept anyone else to decide with whom to trade. It's not like it's a bad idea.
She also predicted, however, that before the United States Government embarked on its next sanctions in November, United States leaders would have the possibility of adopting a range of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that had commercial dealings with Tehran.
In May this year, the United States Government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed and stated that the agreement could not permanently ban the production of nuclear fuel by Iran.
The United States subsequently threatened to ban companies that purchase Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran and the collapse of the Iranian currency.
Companies such as Airbus and the French oil giant, Dawdar, have cancelled billions of dollars of investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have suggested that the United States Government might “take over”.
Indeed, according to a recent Turkish media report, United States sanctions do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iranian oil exports.
Iranian oil minister Zangane has recently revealed that no country other than Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that the purpose of a series of actions on the United States side is to “smuggle” Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif, too, was repulsed by a series of verbal attacks on the US. When asked whether the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, “It is a strategy of regime change, which is the real purpose of the US.” It's not like it's a bad idea.
"Re-Run Guns Remember Fong" : Opening of the Golden Huri Mountain Cultural Tourism Market
In the same year, the first broadcaster from Fujian Front Line radio station, Chen Fifi, who was broadcasting Mandarin Mandarin, came to the cannon and told the story of the cannon.
The well-known tourist attractions, the Ximen Huri hill barrage area, separate from the Golden Gate, were the home of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's “front-line broadcasting station”.
On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the launch of the Front Line Radio station, the scenery region organized the “Re-Running Guns Meek Fong Hua”, inviting a number of historical witnesses to the Front Line Radio station in the current year to talk about the historical changes in the platform and to witness the evolution of cross-Strait relations.
The history of the front-line station was described by witnesses.
This was one of the second series of events on the “Cultural Tourism Markets of the Golden Huri Mountain Artillery”.
This was preceded by the successful organization of the first cultural tourism brand, which brings together cultural tourism IP, creative marketing and traditional folk culture experiences.
On the same day, the second cultural tourism market of the “Couldows of the New Age” organized by the Xiamen Huri Hill Arteries, under the direction of the Chaumen City Board for Development and Development, officially opened a six-day event in which the Mid-Autumn and National Days of the Convergence Circles will be the main theme, allowing the people who come to visit the visitors to experience the rich southern wind in the “eating” “showing” “buying” “recreation.”
The concert heard the voice of the sea has become a major point of view for the cultural tourism market.
Wang Yong, Director of the Huri Hill Guns Management Department, described the “Re-Runking Guns Amelioration” campaign to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the launch of the Front Line Radio station of the Liberation Army Mount Huri, which invited several old cannon broadcasters to tell the history of the cannons and bring people together to remember the past.
In addition to this, the current series of tourism fairs includes events such as the 40th Anniversary Concert of Reform and Opening, the old photo contest, and a public exhibition of large single art devices on both sides of the Straits of 2018.
Among them, the concert “Audience of the Ocean” — which is a major focus of the cultural tourism market of the cannons — is the exclusive cultural branding of the scenes, with the participation of the phoenix women's choirs in Xiamen City, and the 40th anniversary concert of the reform and opening up of the ancient cannons in the mountains and seas, showing the intersection of the ancient cannons with the “New Age”.
A large single-body art exhibition on both sides of the Straits, carried out during the Fourth of July, focused on creating a “eye effect” in a barrage of tourists and citizens to visit, photograph, re-transmit the circle of friends, and make a vibrating sound, adding a “net red” factor to the city.
And the "Salmon 40 years, you and me" - the old photo contest - set up an award-winning exhibition in the scenery to dig deep into the moments of happiness and emotion through a warm photo.
On 30 September, at the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th People ' s Congress of Fujian Province of China (journalist Ryong Min), the General Assembly adopted the Regulation on the Promotion of Ecological Civilization in Fujian Province.
For the first time ever, Green Water and Green Mountain is written into Fujian Province legislation, which is operational and enforceable throughout the regulations.
Fujian is China ' s first ecological civilization pilot zone.
According to the Head of the Legal Department of the People ' s Government of Fujian Province, it is necessary and urgent to develop a comprehensive and holistic basic code for the construction of an ecological civilization that addresses the issue of decentralized regulations and regulations, policy documents regulating the construction of an ecological civilization and providing the legal basis for the development of regulations, normative documents and measures.
This regulation, which fully reflects the Fukuan character, transforms mature experience in ecological civilization-building practices into legal forms of application: In the case of the replicable and replicable “Hingting experience” of the Fujian soil conservation management process, the regulations provide that local people's governments at the county level and above shall strengthen their unified leadership of soil and water conservation, and define priority areas for soil erosion prevention and management, based on the results of the soil erosion survey; and in the case of the river longing system in Fujian province, the regulations raise the length of rivers and lakes to the legislative level, stipulating that the people's governments at the local level should fully implement river and lake longing systems, and implement river and lake pipelines, responsibilities and funding.
The regulation provides for a life-long system of accountability for ecological damage.
The leading leadership cadres and the relevant officials, who are responsible for leadership, will be held accountable for their lives, in contravention of the requirements of scientific development, causing serious damage to ecological resources.
It was explained that the Ordinance on the Promotion of the Construction of Eco-Civilization in Fujian Province will be implemented on 1 November this year.
China agreed to complete the economic corridor construction project in time to accelerate the construction of the port of Guadal
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Sunday that China and Pakistan had agreed to further consolidate and expand their economic relations.
China and Pakistan issued a joint statement on Sunday to further strengthen the strategic partnership.
Both sides reaffirmed their “commitment to the construction of the Central-Palestinian Economic Corridor” and “opposed negative propaganda against the Central-Palestinian Economic Corridor”.
Reuters quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China as stating that China and Pakistan would “strengthen practical cooperation in the field of trade and investment to upgrade Pakistan's industrial capacity through joint ventures in priority areas, the transfer of labour-intensive industries and cooperation with small and medium-sized enterprises”.
According to a press release posted on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the parties agreed to complete the construction of the Central-Palestinian Economic Corridor in a timely manner, to speed up the construction of the port of Guadal and the ancillary projects, to focus on economic and social development, to create jobs and improve livelihoods, and to accelerate cooperation in the areas of industry and parks and agriculture.
“The Parties also agree to conclude the second phase of the CBSA negotiations as soon as possible and to continue the CBSA negotiations. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In the joint statement signed on Sunday, the parties reaffirmed their commitment to the construction of the Central-Palestinian Economic Corridor, which they agreed was a cooperative and win-win programme that would promote regional connectivity and bring prosperity and development to the entire region.
The two sides agreed that the port of Guadal was an important node of cross-regional connectivity and a pillar of the Central-Palestinian economic corridor.
The parties agreed to accelerate the construction of the port of Guadal and the accompanying project.
In the joint statement, China and Pakistan also expressed their opposition to negative propaganda targeting the economic corridor of the Central Pakistan.
The parties agreed to establish a strategic dialogue between the Chinese and Palestinian Foreign Ministers and to transform the former strategic dialogue, at the level of Deputy Foreign Ministers, into diplomatic consultations.
In addition, the two countries will further strengthen defence cooperation by maintaining the exchange of high-level visits by their military forces and exchanges between departments and levels.
In order to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance of China, jointly advised that, as of 1 January 2018, profits allocated to foreign investors from enterprises of residents in China were not subject to the income tax policy for direct investment in China, and that foreign investment incentive projects were extended to all projects and areas not prohibited from foreign investment.
The Ministry of Finance web site contains circulars stating that the withholding of income tax forwards by offshore investors is subject to several conditions, including direct investment by offshore investors on the basis of profit-sharing, including equity investment by offshore investors on the basis of profit-sharing, new construction and equity acquisitions, but does not include new, additional, acquisition of shares of listed companies (except for eligible strategic investments).
It also includes dividends, dividends, etc., from the actual distribution of realized retention gains to investors by resident enterprises in China.
Moreover, profits from direct investments made by offshore investors are paid in cash, the funds are transferred directly from the account of the profit-allocation enterprise to the account of the investor's business or equity transferor and may not be revolving in other accounts, either within or outside the country, until the direct investment is made; the profits from direct investments made by offshore investors are paid in non-cash form, such as in-kind, marketable securities, and the ownership of the assets in question is transferred directly from the profit-allocation enterprise to the investor's business or equity transferor and may not be held by other enterprises, individuals or temporarily until the direct investment.
The circular also states that foreign investors actually recover direct investments that are subject to the withholding of income tax policy treatment through equity transfers, buy-backs, liquidations and, within seven days of the actual collection of the corresponding amounts, declare the payment of deferred taxes to the tax authorities in accordance with the established procedure.
To encourage foreign investors to continue their investment operations in China, four ministries, namely, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce of China, jointly issued circulars at the end of 2017 that, effective 1 January 2017, advance income tax would not be levied on the profits distributed by foreign investors from enterprises of residents in China, directly investing in investment-incentive projects, and on a deferred tax policy, if required.
Last week, the Standing Committee of the Chinese State Council decided to extend the non-collection of income tax for foreign reinvestment from encouraging foreign investment projects to all non-prohibited projects and areas, and to further strengthen intellectual property protection.
Journalists have learned from the National Board of Health that the incidence of malnutrition among our children and young people has decreased compared to decades ago, while the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts pointed out that the most important idea of maintaining healthy weight is to “cure undisease” and to promote scientific fitness and proper diet.
According to the Central Information and Interpretation for Adolescent Health Education (2018 edition) recently published by the National Health and Welfare Commission, the key to maintaining healthy weight is rational diet and scientific campaigns.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not healthy.
The health risks behind the “little chubby” cannot be ignored.
The Director of the Nutrition and Health Unit of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in China, Ting Gang, has indicated that obesity is a threat to the normal growth and development of adolescents and has a negative psychological, behavioural, cognitive and intellectual impact. It can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood resin in children.
At the same time, the vulnerability of adolescents to overweight obesity continues into adulthood, increasing the risk of adolescents becoming adults with chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes.
According to Ting Gang, the 2010-2012 nutritional and health testing of Chinese residents showed that our youth aged 6-17 years had a prevalence of 9.6% overweight and 6.4% obese, adding up to 16%.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and young people is characterized by a higher prevalence of boys than girls and urban than rural areas, with a marked increase in the rate of overweight obesity in recent decades.
How can adolescents cope with overweight obesity?
According to Zhang Zhang, Deputy Director of the Research Centre for Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion of the National Directorate of Sports, obesity among adolescents is currently due mainly to excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
In the case of simple obesity, emphasis should be placed on scientific sports and reasonable dietary control.
Zhang Zhang pointed out that the most important concept is to maintain healthy weight, the most important of which is to “care for the undisease”, which is to educate schools, parents and students in all aspects of science, to spread awareness of the dangers of overweight and obesity and to raise awareness among adolescents.
Adolescents should undergo periodic medical examinations to monitor growth and development indicators, such as height and weight, and to identify early detection and scientific determination of overweight and obesity, with a view to timely intervention.
For those who are already overweight and obese, the Dinh-Silt Power recommends that, in addition to the active scientific organization of meals and sports, adolescents are at a particular stage of physical development and should refrain from using hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce body weight and must not be blindly used to reduce weight.
On Friday, 28 September, Reuters - Facebook (FB.O) reported that hackers had stolen digital landing codes, giving them nearly 50 million user accounts with unprecedented coverage and the most serious security breach in their history.
The monthly Facebook user exceeds 2.2 billion, stating that it has not yet been determined whether the attackers have abused any accounts or stolen personal information.
The company also did not locate the location of the hacker, nor did it determine whether the hacker was targeted at specific victims.
Preliminary analysis indicates that this was a large-scale attack.
Executive Director Zuckerberg called the incident “severely serious” in a media conference.
A spokesman for the company stated that his account number and that of Chief Operator Sheryl Sandberg were also affected.
Facebook has dropped 2.6% on Friday, dragging Wall Street's main stock finger.
On Friday, United States parliamentarians stated that the attack could increase outside calls for data privacy legislation.
“This is another sad piece of evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users,” said Democratic Senator Mark Warner in a statement.
Rohit Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said on Twitter that I would like to get answers to Reuters's report on this security breach.
On September 30, China's fifth martyr's day.
On such a special day, members of various sectors of society, including members of the families of the veterans, representatives of the Democratic Party, and representatives of the Hunan Veterans' Home, came to Changsha City to attend a mass burial ceremony in 2018 to commemorate the Day of the War Veterans, with 10 other veterans and four former veterans.
“The anti-war veterans are witnesses to the Chinese resistance and are true, vivid and visible teaching materials of patriotism. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Liu Xiao, former Vice-President of the Hunan Province Political Consultative Council, stated that the brave and courageous veterans of the war and the spirit of patriotism that they had left behind were a precious spiritual asset for the contemporary nation.
In his statement, the Vice-President of the Changsha Municipal Council and the Chairman of the Council of the Chiefs of Civil and Political Affairs, Zhu Jianjiang, stated that in recent years the “Care for War Veterans” project, which provides care services to war veterans in the form of living allowances, free old-age pensions, and free burials, has become an excellent brand of social services for the citizens of Changsha.
In his view, only by placing history in his heart could the spirit of resistance be inherited.
At 11 a.m., in the solemn and heavy sound of music, the participants stood up.
The members of the Chinese troupe were dressed in tuxedos, carrying flowers, and were able to move at a steady pace in order to get together 10 war veterans and four war veterans.
The participants paid tribute to the war veterans for their flowers and the many children in the crowd who had joined their parents in paying tribute to the war heroes.
The “Tang Man's Mansion Park Against War” was the first national mausoleum on the theme of fighting, created jointly by the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Hunan Tang Man's Mansion Park Company, in 2014.
The first stage of the project, which covers more than 2,000 square metres of land, consists of elements such as the “Homeless Monuments” and “Viction Square” and the “Resilence Heroes' Hills”.
The Anti-War Heroes Mansion, which provides a graveyard free of charge to the anti-war heroes, has been hailed as “the last barracks of the anti-war veterans”.
Every year, before and after dawn and the National Day, large-scale public ceremonies and burials are held at the estate.
Since 2015, there have been seven collective burials of war veterans, with 102 war veterans and partners sleeping there.

Following the implementation of the new regulations, the security screening plan was issued once a day at 0900 hours and again at 2100 hours, while the pass-through plan was issued at 1400 hours and 2000 hours respectively, to allow ships flexibility in scheduling the dam.
The Movement Control Protocol added the principle of “classification control” for the movement of ships across dams, and the prioritization of ships at dams was determined according to the functional position of the gates and lifters, and short-line passenger ships at gates were adjusted to the same level of priority as demonstration ships and good faith ships.
It is also two weeks after the piloting of the lifter, which is officially coordinated with the gate.
For the first time, the river and the three canyons of the canyon are also being prioritized by large-sized demonstration ships and new energy power vessels.
At the same time, the Movement Control Protocol adjusts the “routing movement management waters” from the previous 180 km near dam to 541.8 km from the Yunyang Yang River Bridge to the Ishi River Bridge, and divides the “core waters, near dam waters, controlled waters, movement waters”.
This has facilitated the choice of suitable water to be shut down and reduced the backlog of dam-bound ships.
The Movement Control Protocol also provides for good faith measures such as the cancellation of declarations of non-compliance and 24-hour delay in the passage of the dam, taking into account the characteristics of the existing ship crossing and the waiting period.
With the storage of water in the three canyons, the condition of navigation in the storage area has improved, contributing to the rapid development of the Yangtze shipping.
Data show that the annual cargo traffic through the three canyon gates and the Goku dam has increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons, respectively, in 2017.
Three canyon lifters have been on trial for two years through 5767 ships, 1622,000 passengers and 1,7128,000 tons of cargo.
The Deputy Director General of the Three Gorges Navigation Authority, Chen Dong Won, stated that the Movement Control Protocol had a positive effect on the promotion of good-faith gate management, the maintenance of traffic order at the two dam hubs, the decomposition of pressure on ships in the dam area and the enhancement of navigational capacity.
China's weather network “11” has begun its small holiday, and it is expected that during the day, there will still be winds of around 6-7 in the capital, which are still in the middle of the Great Wind Blue Alert.
During the holiday period, the weather was fine, and there was only autumn rain on the night of the 5th day.
However, the temperature difference between day and night is more than 10°C, and it is colder and warmer and colder.
Early and evening temperatures in the city were further reduced, with the southern suburbs having reached a low temperature of 7.6°C in the early morning, breaking the 10°C line, with the maximum temperature rising to 20.2°C during the day, with a very high temperature difference between day and night, and a strong northern wind blowing, which, although good weather is blowing, is not warm.
This morning, the sky in Beijing was clear and colder.
The “XI” small holiday has begun, and the Beijing city weather station predicts that there are clouds during the day, around the fourth class of the northern wind, with a maximum temperature of 25°C, and a minimum temperature of 12°C in the evening, the second stage of the northern wind.
It is still in the middle of a wind blue alert, where the public needs to be protected from high-altitude crashes outside the house; the temperature differential between day and night is above 10°C and is cold early and late, with appropriate clothing additions.
During the Eleventh Century, the weather in the city was clear and light, cool and comfortable, and it was generally suitable for outdoor activities. Only autumn rain arrived in Kyoto on the night of the 5th day, and the public needed to pay attention to the proximate forecast.
Temperatures fall after rain, especially at about 9°C at night.
The data released yesterday by the Beijing Meteorological Service Centre averaged only 51 days in the autumn of Beijing.
The longest autumn in Beijing since 2001 was 67 days in 2003; the shortest autumn occurred in 2017 and only 36 days.
Meteorological experts reminded me that today Beijing has a large north wind, class VI-VII, and travels to guard against the wind.
If the wind is dry, care should be taken that the water is re-humid, and that the safety of the fire and the safety of the fire must also be observed when travelling.
In case of early and late movement, the clothing needs to be properly added.
With the approval of Prime Minister Li Keqiang, the State Council issued the Decision on the Regulation of Licensing for Production of Industrial Products and the Simplified Approval Procedure.
The Decision proposes to further reduce the catalogue of licences for the production of industrial products, eliminate the regulation of licences for the production of 14 categories of industrial products, and devolve authority for the licensing of the production of 4 types of industrial products to the provincial people ' s governments for technical supervision of quality.
As a result of this reform, the implementation of industrial product production licensing will be reduced from 38 last year to the current 24 categories.
The Decision makes it clear that there is a simplified approval process for the catalogue of products.
The first is to replace pre-licensed product inspection by a pre-licensed product inspection by an enterprise submitting, at the time of application, a product inspection report from a qualified testing and inspection agency.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, the technical supervision department of the provincial people ' s government for quality (market supervision) carries out on-site review of the products licensed, and after submitting applications and product inspection qualified reports and making a commitment to ensure product quality security, enterprises receive a production licence after formal clearance and are then subject to on-site review within a specified time frame.
Thirdly, the production of different categories of products in the catalogue of business operations is subject to a review of the issuance of a licence together with a new application for a licence or a renewal of a licence, in accordance with the principle of “one enterprise, one certificate”.
The Decision requires the regions and relevant departments to advance firmly the work on the catalogue and the simplified approval process.
(b) Increase the level of disclosure and back-office review of enterprises ' commitments, strengthen credit monitoring and restraint instruments, enforce corporate responsibility for quality, and revoke production licences in cases of false commitments and non-compliance.
In the case of products that are subject to the elimination of licences for the production of industrial products, there is a need to effectively strengthen post-facto regulation. Products involving public health and safety, environmental protection, etc., can be converted to compulsory certification, positive lists are drawn up and publicized to society, certification standards are harmonized, the costs of compulsory certification are reasonably reduced and certified, and the costs of compulsory certification are, in principle, institutionally covered by all levels of finance.
Support measures to encourage voluntary certification by enterprises and promote branding and market expansion.
The improvement of the quality of industrial products needs to be driven by international standards of excellence.
Full use of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality of industrial products.
In the case of products that retain a licence to manufacture industrial products, the system of standards should be improved, the industry's regulatory advantages should be exploited, the responsibility for “who approves and regulates” should be strengthened, the risks to product quality safety should be assessed on a dynamic basis, and the catalogue should be reduced, approval authority delegated or converted to certification management.
In September, China's combined PMI ring up manufacturing PMI ring down.
According to data released by the National Statistical Office of China on 30 September, China ' s integrated PMI output index was 54.1 per cent, higher than the previous month ' s and annual averages of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that Chinese enterprises ' production activities remained generally stable.
In that month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which make up the composite PMI output index, were 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively, a decrease of one litre.
Of these, the Chinese manufacturing PMI is 50.8 per cent, and the ring is down 0.5 percentage points.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the production of PMI this month has five main characteristics:
The first is that the manufacturing base is generally stable.
In 14 of the 21 industries surveyed, PMIs are located in expansionary zones, with the manufacturing of medicines, specialized equipment, electrical machinery, etc. having a higher performance level of 53.5 per cent and growing faster.
The second is small fluctuations in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0 per cent and 52.0 per cent, which were 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points lower than last month, respectively, while supply and demand continued to maintain a favourable state, although expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index was 48.0 per cent and the import index 48.5 per cent, which was below 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points last month, respectively, and reached a low point during the year.
Fourth is the increased cost of purchasing raw materials from enterprises.
The main raw materials purchase price index was 59.8 per cent, an increase of 1.1 percentage points over the previous month, and the output price index was 54.3 per cent, which was the same as the previous month, both of which were higher in the year.
Fifth is the robust operation of large enterprises and the continuing improvement in the performance of small enterprises.
This year, the index has been in expansion areas of 52.0% and above, with both the production index and the new order index increasing this month, and is the main driving force behind the expansion of manufacturing; the medium-sized PMI stands at 48.7%, down from 1.7 percentage points last month, in the contraction zone; and the small enterprise PMI stands at 50.4%, up from 0.4 percentage points last month, rising for two months.
That month, China ' s non-manufacturing business activity index stood at 54.9 per cent, an increase of 0.7 percentage points over last month and a two-month recovery.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the non-manufacturing sector in general continues to enjoy a steady and positive momentum.
The index of business activity in industries such as road transport, securities and real estate continues to be below the threshold, with a decrease in total business.
Reuters, 5 November - The President of Japan’s Central Bank, Haruhiko Kuroda, stated on Monday that the Bank was aware that the long-term imposition of ultra-lax monetary policy could squeeze the profitability of financial institutions and potentially destabilize the country’s banking system.
However, he stated that, given the low inflation and uncertainty in the overseas economies, the JCB needed to maintain its massive stimulus package, while paying close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
“The Central Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected by continued monetary easing.” In an address to business leaders in Nagoya, Haruhiko Kuroda said.
He argued that if financial institutions were to be more proactive in taking on risks to compensate for the shrinking profit margins caused by years of low interest rates, the banking system could become volatile in the event of serious negative shocks.
“Although these risks are not significant at the moment, the central bank will follow the situation closely and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures”, he said.
The minutes of the Central Bank of Japan meeting, published earlier Monday, show that at the September conference, the Central Bank of Japan Policy Committee discussed the rising costs of long-term easing.
The minutes of the meeting indicate that one member stated that if the economy continues to expand, “the Bank of Japan will have more policy flexibility in the future. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The minutes of the meeting showed another member that, given the limitations of the duration of the policy, the Committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan could sustain the stimulus.
Kuroda stated that the Central Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks posed by easing policies, taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan ' s economic outlook, which could affect global demand as a result of trade frictions between China and the United States and growing protectionism.
“The impact of such problems on Japan’s economy has been limited for the time being,” said Haruhiko Kuroda.
“However the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy may be greater”, he added.
“There is a need to sustain strong monetary easing while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner,” said Haruhiko Kuroda.
Despite the rise in the ills of radical stimulus packages, such as long-term low interest rates that erode the profits of financial institutions, low inflation forces the Central Bank of Japan to maintain the scheme.
The Central Bank of Japan had maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war dispute, Kuroda had ruled out the possibility of rising interest rates in the near future.
Enterprise logo for the Tesla electric vehicle, Cardiff, United States, 1 June 2018.
Under a settlement agreement, the United States Tesla Automotive and its Executive Chairman Mask have agreed to pay a fine of $20 million each to the Financial Regulatory Authority, and Mask will resign as Chairman of the company but remain CEO.
The settlement agreement will put an end to the two-month unrest in Tesla.
The securities fraud allegations and settlement agreement disclosed on Saturday by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission would be a relief to investors.
Investors had feared that the prolonged legal struggle would only serve to further undermine the still-lost electric car company.
The SEC sued Mask on Thursday for fraud, claiming that its tweet of 7 August misled the investor.
According to the tweet, he was considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per share and had received financing.
The Commission claims that these tweets were not actually substantiated and that the market turmoil they caused was detrimental to investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts stated that the agreement could strengthen Tesla, which had been severely damaged by the recent actions of Mask.
Steven Heim, the head of Boston Common asset management, said that the settlement agreement should have placed Mask under more scrutiny, without taking “destructive” measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The Asset Management Company holds the Panasonic shares of the battery manufacturer in Tesla.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to establish controls over Mask communications.
“It is in the best interest of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, to resolve this matter quickly on the terms agreed upon,” President Clayton of SEC said in a statement.
The charges on Thursday resulted in the evaporation of the market value of Tesla, which was $45.2 billion at Friday, down from $47.5 billion for General purpose vehicles.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC withdrew the request to remove Mask from the company ' s head.
Many investors argue that the penalty would be catastrophic.
“I think this is the best possible outcome for all concerned.” Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners said that Feinseth gave Tesla a “neutral” rating and stated that the SEC punishment was “a light penalty” for Mask.
“The fact that he is still CEO is important for Tesla. It's not like we're going anywhere.
Neither Mask nor Tesla recognized or denied the SEC ' s allegations in the settlement agreement, nor responded immediately to the request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be ratified by the court.
The Beijing Morning News (journalist Wang Ping) Beijing Morning News reporter learned from Beijing Construction Industries Group that one of the core building blocks of the Beijing Park 2019 - the Beijing World Park Show Square project will for the first time be a multi-colored ETFE puzzled membrane, with 5440 square metres of membrane in deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red, green six colours, and a "butter wing" under the lasagna.
According to Liu Changbao, the head of the Beijing Construction and Construction Group Project, the construction of a 4,500 square metre area in the performing square was built with a total steel capacity of 1,182 tons, the steel structure was supported by a 26-square umbrella lined slab of suspension steel, and a “butterfly wing” was presented under the Zhang pull of the draw.
“From above the sky, the plaza is like a flowering, dancing butterflies, and the colours do not fade with time.”
Previously, the monochrome ETFE membrane structure had been widely used in bird nests, water cubes, etc., but the multicolourized ETFE membrane structure was the first in the country.
Journalists have learned that, since there are very few suppliers of multi-colour structure production around the world, each membrane structural material is “precious”.
Liu Changbao stated that to avoid overlaps at the end of the line and problems such as “fighting”, an innovative “two-knocking” headline structure would also be introduced to ensure that the “fighting” tie was in the right place through a fixed plug.
The construction of the Beijing World Park is currently under way.
Of these, the International Pavilion works have been completed for all of the “varnish” suspension works.
The project is scheduled to be ready for display by the end of October.

According to Liu Yuanjie, “90 years later”, who worked in Los Angeles, most of the photo recording took place before his birth and was unknown.
“Slowly in time, I feel that China has come step by step and become stronger, and that we are particularly heartened by the fact that we are in the diaspora.” Liu said.
Many Chinese returned to China to participate in the celebration.
On the evening of 27th, 2018 “Cultural China Global Chinese Concert” was played at the Beijing National Theatre, and the diaspora was invited to watch.

Abe's going to put Ganley on top of the HDZ.
On October 1st, China News Network (CSN) reported that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's two-day cabinet reshuffle and top party personnel adjustment were in the final stages of discussion.
Coordination is currently under way to regenerate the economy to the four key positions of the party, namely, the Chairman of the Electoral Response Commission or the President of the General Council.
This information was reportedly revealed by regime-related sources on 1 day.
Abe had a meeting at the official residence in the afternoon with the leader of the Ping Ming Party, Nakaguchi.
Yamaguchi demanded that the PMT party's territorial traffic be allowed to remain in office.
Abe 'will explore '.
Yamaguchi revealed this to the media.
At noon at the official residence, Abe met with the Vice President of the Parti Démocratiques pour la Libération du Peuple and asked for a revision of the Constitution “in the hope that it will continue to help in the future”.
Takamura currently serves as a special adviser to the party headquarters for constitutional reform.
According to the information received, Ganley, as a promoter of “Abenomics”, had been in charge of economic regeneration since December 2012, when the second Abe Cabinet came to power, but had resigned in January 2016 because of the money scandal.
In the election of the party president, he served as the head of the Abe electoral response headquarters.
With regard to the four key posts of the party, Abe intends to keep the Director-General, Joon-bak, and the Chief of the Political Investigation Council, Wen Hung, in office.
The President of the General Council, who is responsible for consolidating discussions within the party concerned with the revision of the Constitution, and who directs the election of the President of the Senate for the next year's election, has been the focus.
With regard to the Cabinet, it has been decided essentially to maintain the skeletons of the regime, such as the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso, and the Chief Executive Secretary.
Ishii, who served as President of the Ping Ming Party, and others, served for the first time in the Cabinet reshuffle in October 2015 for about three years.
Abe will decide on senior personnel in the morning at the HDZ general meeting.
It is planned that the list of cabinet members will be published in the afternoon, followed by a certification ceremony at the palace.
Reuters, September 30, - The CSRC officially released its revised Guidelines on Corporate Governance on Sunday, which focused on further strengthening the constraints on holding shareholders, de facto controllers and their affiliates, focusing more on the protection of small and medium-sized investors, and acting as a protection agency for small and medium-sized investors; and actively drawing on international experience to promote institutional investor involvement in corporate governance.
The SEC noted that the revised guidelines cover the basic concepts and principles of listed corporate governance, the composition and functioning of shareholders ' conferences, boards, supervisory boards, the rights and obligations of directors, supervisors and senior managers, the incentives of listed companies, and the conduct of controlling shareholders and their affiliates.
The new guidelines also include the involvement of institutional investors and related institutions in corporate governance, the basic requirements of listed companies with regard to stakeholders, environmental protection and social responsibility, and information disclosure and transparency.
The revised guidelines require listed companies to implement innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development concepts in corporate governance, increase party construction requirements for listed companies and strengthen the leading role of listed companies in environmental protection and social responsibility.
Strengthen the Board ' s audit committee role and establish the basic framework for environmental, social responsibility and corporate governance (ESG) information disclosure.
In addition, in response to concerns, the new guidelines put new demands on the stability of control faced by listed corporate governance, the functioning of independent directors, high-level evaluation and incentive restraint mechanisms for directors of listed companies, and enhanced information disclosure.
The CVM also stated that, in accordance with the new guidelines, it would study and refine the relevant regulations and normative documents, and guide self-regulatory organizations such as the stock exchange and the Chinese Association of Listed Companies in developing and revising the relevant rules of self-regulation and gradually improving the system of rules governing listed corporate governance.
At the same time, the training of listed companies has been stepped up, the self-consciousness of listed companies in improving governance and regulating their operations has been strengthened and the quality of listed companies has been continuously improved.
On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that China would not close its doors but would only open its doors and move towards higher levels of openness.
The expansion of imports is not an equity measure, but a long-term future-oriented consideration, and it is expected that China ' s imports of goods and services will exceed $30 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively, over the next 15 years.
In his keynote address at the first China International Import Fair, Xi will further reduce tariffs, accelerate new business developments such as cross-border electric operators, continue to liberalize market access, promote the opening of services, and ease foreign equity restrictions in areas such as education and health, where domestic markets have large gaps.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors.
He stated that China would urgently examine and propose a phased approach to the construction of a free trade port policy and institutional system in Hainan and accelerate the process of exploring the construction of a Chinese-style free trade port; the addition of new areas in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone; and the creation of a new science board and pilot registration system at the Shanghai Sea Certificate Exchange to support the development of regional integration in the Yangtze Delta, which would be elevated to a national strategy.
“The Chinese economy is an ocean, not a small pond.
When the wind is calm, and when there is a storm, Xi is saying, "The storm can blow up the pond, but not the sea."
The sea is still there!
After more than 5,000 years of hardship, China is still there!
For the future, China will always be here! It's not like we're going anywhere.
He pointed out that economic globalization had been globalized in such a way that multilateralism and free trade regimes had been affected, that uncertainties remained high and risk challenges had increased; and that open cooperation was an important engine for enhanced international economic and trade cooperation, and that countries should adhere to openness and accommodation, expand mutually beneficial development space and enhance macroeconomic coordination.
He stressed once again that China would not close its doors, but would only open up and move towards higher levels of openness.
China will stimulate the potential for imports, respond to the upward trend in domestic consumption, take more active and effective measures to promote income growth and foster higher- and middle-level consumer growth.
China will respect international business practices and treat all types of enterprises registered in China equally.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-owned enterprises. It will firmly punish violations of the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors, especially intellectual property rights, improve the quality and efficiency of intellectual property reviews, introduce punitive compensation systems and significantly increase the cost of violations.
Turning to China's economic prospects, Xi stated that the economic performance of the country was in a reasonable range of key indicators, such as economic growth, employment, prices, balance of payments, corporate profits, fiscal revenues and labour productivity, which provided an important basis for achieving the year-round goals.
China ' s economic growth remains among the highest in the world compared to other major economies.
“The fundamentals of healthy stability in China's economic development have not changed, the conditions of production factors underpinning high-quality development have not changed, and the overall momentum towards long-term stability has not changed. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Xi said that there was room for optimism about China ' s economic development prospects.
Xi stated that China ' s macro-regulation capacity was growing, that it had many favourable conditions for long-term sound and stable economic development, and that China ' s economic development was currently facing outstanding contradictions and problems, and that measures were being taken to actively address them, and that the results had been and were showing.
“Believes that China's economy will be able to accelerate its transition to a high-quality development path as long as it maintains its strategic will and deepens its reforms and openings in a comprehensive manner, with a view to resolving outstanding contradictions and problems. Xi Jinping says.

The number of deaths due to the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 420 and there are no reported casualties among Chinese citizens.
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, was raised to 420 by the official Indonesia Antara News Agency, which quoted Wilem Rampanilei, the head of the national disaster response agency, at midnight on 29 October.
According to the official, this is only statistics from the city of Palu, capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, and does not include the town of Dungara during the earthquake and the nearby area of Sigi, where communications are still disrupted and no reports of the number of people killed have been received.
Search-and-rescue efforts have encountered considerable difficulties as many roads in Palu city have been severely damaged and heavy machinery is difficult to access.
In order to guarantee relief, all commercial flights were suspended on the 29th night of the reopening of Palu airport, which had begun to close on the night of 28, and the flights from Jakarta to Palu were cancelled that night.

The Director of the Central Institute of Aerodynamics of Žukovski, Russia, Serpalo, said: " The ultrasound project is being carried out under an international group plan and a contract with the Ministry of Industry and Trade. "
We believe that it will take two to three years for the technical demonstration and another 10 to 15 years for civilian aircraft production.
Šeparón said that the problem facing Russian scientists was how to balance the economic and safety of aircraft.
He said that ultrasonic aircraft were characterized by significant noise effects.
According to Šepalo, the Institute is working with the Moscow Air Academy and the Tupolev Design Department to develop a full range of civilian ultrasound aircraft, including official and large passenger aircraft for commercial transportation.
The Secretary-General, Xi Jinping, delivered a very important speech at a private enterprise symposium, which injected firm confidence in the private economy moving towards a wider arena.
The Secretary-General of Xi emphasized that “leting entrepreneurs take their heads off and move forward light” has generated strong resonance among a wide range of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamism comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, and from entrepreneurship.
Over the 40-year-long process of reform and opening-up, tens of millions of entrepreneurs have stories of entrepreneurship and innovation, and groups of entrepreneurs have grown and continue to push the Chinese economy forward.
For some time now, some in society have made some negative statements that doubt the private economy.
Mistakes such as the so-called “private economy out-of-the-box” “new public-private partnership” have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered difficulties and problems in their development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some exporting firms; rapid adjustment of demand structures has put pressure on transformation and upgrading; some policies are uncoordinated, their effects overlap with those of simple working methods, resulting in counterproductive effects of well-intentioned policies.
A combination of factors, difficulties in the private economy, difficulties in the operation of some private enterprises, and a lot of anxiety on the part of entrepreneurs.
Against this background, it is particularly relevant to correct perceived misperceptions, remove the burden of entrepreneurial thinking, allow businesses to pursue their development with one purpose, and the Government to promote development with one purpose in mind.
At the symposium, the important assertion that “the three remain unchanged” was re-emphasized: “The place and role of the non-publicized economy in the economic and social development of our country has not changed!”
In recent years, the central party has placed unprecedented emphasis on and institutional safeguards for entrepreneurs, ranging from the further promotion of decentralization, the establishment of a system of lists of powers to the creation of a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a level playing field in the market and the creation of a society-wide atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs.
The symposium, in particular, clearly identified policy initiatives in support of private enterprise development in six areas, and launched a series of practical actions aimed at “light moving forward” private enterprises.
These are a great encouragement to the entrepreneurial community and give greater expectations to all sectors of society.
The fog is moving away, the approach is set, and the key is implementation.
It is important to constantly create a better environment for private economic development, help private enterprises to resolve their development difficulties and help to upgrade China ' s economic transition. It is important to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel secure in legal operations, feel respect in social life, stimulate innovation and create creative potential.
The Chinese economy has entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to develop their ambitions and providing greater space and arena for entrepreneurs to develop their creativity.
We have reason to believe that, as reforms deepen and obstacles break, the private economy will usher in better prospects and opportunities for development, leading to a broader arena.
All 46 internal Mongolian import/export certificates are networked.
According to Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sina-Sino-Shu-Shu-Sho
Inner Mongolian enterprises can declare relevant documents to customs by paperless means, avoiding problems such as past on-site runaways, paper applications and duplicate submissions.
It is understood that the time of preparation of documents, which refers to the types of documents required for the import and export chain prior to the declaration of customs, is a major factor affecting the overall time of clearance, which must be reduced in order to compress the time of clearance and reduce the cost of clearance.
The number of regulatory documents previously required for customs verification at the import and export chain was 86, involving 19 departments.
According to the information received, this time, in accordance with the principle of “can cancel, merge, exit from export verification” and de-export verification, customs and 16 other licensing agency systems are linked to and interconnected with the international trade “single window” platform, resulting in multiple data runaways and fewer businesses.
Customs claims that, in the past, businesses had had to submit paper applications to and from the field offices of the departments concerned, which were lengthy and did not allow for real-time follow-up.
Business users now have direct access to the Single Window portal for online applications.
Following the approval by the issuing authority, electronic data on certificates are transmitted to customs and automated matching with customs clearance data is achieved at the clearance point, smart checks are carried out, and the results are uniformly fed back to the enterprise through a “single window” and a full-process online processing of regulatory document declarations, clearances, clearances and feedback is achieved.
Han Zhuang chicken soup increased his exports to China by 20 times in four years, or was associated with an increase in youth in air nests - a new net.
The Korean chicken soup to China increased 20 times in four years.
Korea's chicken soup exports to China exceeded $100,000 last year, about 20 times higher than in 2013 four years ago.
The analysis suggests that this increase is linked to the increase in youth in air nests in China, which leads to thermal marketing of convenient foods, and the increased interest of young people in feeding.
This data was published on the 5th day of the Korean Agro-Aquatic Food Circulation Society (AT).
Last year, South Korean chicken soup exports to China amounted to $103.39 million, weighing 21.859 million kg, an increase of 2094 per cent and 3668.8 per cent, respectively, over 2013.
The analysis concluded that the increase in Korean chicken soup sales in China was related to the increase in youth nests leading to thermal marketing of convenient foods and the increased interest of young people in feeding.
As of this year, one-person households in China have crossed the 200 million mark and are expected to increase to 30 per cent of the total population by 2020, and local food companies are also targeting the so-called "meals" to launch convenient foods.
In addition, the analysis indicated that avian influenza was the largest factor hindering the mainland Chinese market for gin chicken soup.
aT states that there was an avian influenza outbreak in Korea between November 2016 and April last year, and that the authorities imposed a total ban on chicken soup exports to China, resulting in a sharp decline in exports.
In 2016, chicken soup exports to China amounted to $840,000, and exports dropped sharply to $100,000 last year due to avian influenza.
The launch of the first Anhui Corporation High-quality Development Forum and Anhui Corporation Report was held in Hoi Fat City.
The Standing Committee of the Anhui Provincial Council and the Deputy Governor-General of the Province, Deng Hsiyang, stated that the Forum was intended to create a comprehensive exchange platform for cross-border integration and integration. It was of great relevance for promoting the healthy growth of companies listed in Anhui, promoting capital markets and building innovative and modern industrial systems.
Anhui will further strengthen the company's market reserve, promote the organic integration of the Emhum industry, the new industries and the capital market, actively nurture the listed resources, and play the role of “lead sheep” in leading industrial upgrading and nurturing new dynamics of economic development.
Chen Zhang stated that promoting the transformation of the Anhui economy and achieving high-quality development urgently required the promotion of efficiency gains by Emu listed companies to lead by geese.
It is hoped that this forum will begin with the creation of a platform for co-building, sharing and sharing of `economic finance' integration, forming a strategic alliance around listed companies and a “investment + investment” capital ecology.
The number of provincial conglomerates with 45 listed companies is definitely ahead of the rest of the province.
In terms of industry distribution, Emblem listed companies cover 13 industries, with nearly 70 per cent concentrated in manufacturing, with a low proportion of companies listed in strategic and new technologies.
The largest festival in South America was held in Lima, the capital of Peru.
The event, organized by local Peruvian fans, lasted four days, with an estimated 100,000 visitors.

State-wide flag-raising ceremony at the border crossing point of the China-China border to celebrate National Day
“It is not surprising that there is such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony on the border, which is more shocking than watching it in the interior. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In the morning, Mr. Zhang, who had travelled from Sichuan to the Yunnan River crossing point at the border between China and China, joined over 500 troops, residents and tourists from China and China to observe the flag-raising ceremony at the national level to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the establishment of the People ' s Republic of China.
The estuary is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the border between China and China. It is located at the port district of the Red River State in Yunnan Province. It is located along the same river as Viet Nam's old street and is a national crossing.
As China's one of the most convenient routes to South-East Asia deepens the country's “one-way path”, the port of entry and exit traffic has steadily increased.
At 7.30 a.m. on the morning of that day, the light had just come out of the sun, and the limited areas at the river crossing had already gathered early in the morning the local population at the estuary and the tourists from the centre and beyond to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 0745 hours the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the State guard unit at the port border checkpoint were in a state of tremor and escorted the flag to the flag-raising stage at a healthy pace.
Following the commanding officer's command to raise the flag, the raised flag worked hard to draw an arc, and the bright red flag spreads like a “hawk wings up”, with the country's anthem rising with a strong melody.
“Having a flag-raising ceremony at every important time point, such as New Year’s Day, Spring Festival, and National Day, not only shows China’s image, but also inspires love among people across borders. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The men and women of the army who took part in the flag-raising ceremony said:
According to the information received, the national service, which is responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the port of the river, consists of more than 40 officers and officers from various positions at the port border checkpoint, from a three-person flag-raising team to a force of over 60 years of age, with more than 70 missions of foreign servicemen at the national level since their establishment.
The new revised Personal Income Tax Act adjusts the criteria for the determination of taxpayers of Chinese personal income tax residents from one year to 183 days.
The relevant heads of the Ministry of Finance and the National Tax Administration of China indicated on 30 December that, in order to maintain policy stability, the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons outside China, including Hong Kong and Macao, would be considered in the next steps to implement the new personal income tax law.
The Officer-in-Charge indicated that the regulations in force for the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Act provide special advantages for the taxation of persons abroad, and that persons who do not have residence in China but live for a period of more than one year and less than five years may pay personal income tax only in respect of a portion of the income paid by units in China or individuals.
Part of the payments made abroad are not subject to personal income tax in China.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Tax Administration, the State Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce of China have also issued circulars expanding the scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax payments from foreign investors for direct investment in the distribution of profits.
The profits allocated to foreign investors from resident enterprises in China for direct investment in China are suspended from the application of the policy of pre-image income tax, and the foreign investment incentive category is extended to all projects and areas not prohibited from foreign investment.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released on the Korean peninsula.
The President of the Republic of Korea, in his statement, conveyed his country's “irreversible” decision to abandon nuclear weapons and indicated that United States President Trump and North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un might meet before the end of the year.
The United States Department of State subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeyo would visit the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea in October to facilitate the implementation of the commitments made at the meeting between United States and Korean leaders in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea has broken the ice to open the path of dialogue, and the leaders of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and the United States have met. The general trend towards a de-escalation of the situation on the peninsula has continued, as has the principle of dialogue in resolving the problems on the peninsula.
First, the fact that “the issue of the peninsula is essentially a security issue” remains unchanged, and that the key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to address the legitimate security concerns of the parties in a sound and balanced manner, rather than to put pressure on each other and to focus on their claims.
Second, in the dialogue towards the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned remain divided on the steps and modalities for the denuclearization of the peninsula, and the “who first” game thinking remains strong, owing to the chronic lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States.
At the Security Council's public meeting on the Korean peninsula, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices around the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again highlighted these two points as “unchanged”.
United States Secretary of State Pompeyo insisted that sanctions against the DPRK would not be lifted until the Korean peninsula was completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, for his part, stressed the principle of “action in response” by pointing out that “the weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the steps taken by North Korea on the path to nuclear abandonment.”
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Council's resolutions in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but that pressure is not an end in itself and that the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the Council's resolutions. The two must not be sidelined.
As Wang Yi, Secretary of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, said, given the current positive developments in inter-Korean, inter-Korean and inter-American relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider launching reversible provisions in due course, thus encouraging the DPRK and all parties concerned to take further steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process require sufficient political courage from the parties.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community for a political solution to the issue of the peninsula, it is particularly important for the parties concerned to show political will, make political decisions, implement their commitments, resolve their difficulties and continue to take steps in the direction of one another, advance the process of denuclearization of the peninsula in parallel with the establishment of peace mechanisms on the peninsula and work together to establish a permanent peace on the peninsula.
The People ' s Government of the city of Pingyi, Shanxi Province, on 1 day, reported that during the National Day, the yellow river canal waterfall area, located in the district, would remain relatively high and not open.
To ensure security, the view area was temporarily closed during the National Day.
The yellow canteens are the second largest waterfall in China and the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
The Yellow River runs here, and the walls of the two banks are soared and the mouth of the river is so narrow as to form a “close of the Yellow River”.
According to the press, the Yellow River is known to be from June to October of each year, beginning on 12 July 2018, as the Yellow River is high and the mouthscape of the Yellow River in Shanxi began to close, so that the mouthscape area has been closed for almost a month.
Nyu Feng, the chief engineer of the CMS, said to the media that this was the longest time in nearly 20 years that the Yellow River's high water level had lasted, “It has not been so long before, we closed for four days in 2017, almost a month this year. It's not like it's a bad idea.
It is understood that the Yellow River Port Falls area in Shanxi, which was supposed to be in preparation for the Golden Week of the Eleven, is already in place with additional staffing arrangements and vehicle maintenance, even temporary staff.
According to the “Notice for the Defence of the Yellow River during the National Day” issued by the Office of the General Command for the Prevention of Drought and the Protection of the Yellow River, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong Provinces were asked to do the Defence of the Yellow River during the National Day.
At present, the flow of the Yellow River is relatively high, with the flow of the upper channel being maintained at 2000 - 3,000 cubic metres per second, the flow of the middle channel at 2,500 - 3,500 cubic metres per second and the flow of the lower channel at 3,000 cubic metres per second.
Health centres and health posts provide influenza vaccination services especially during the national holiday.
This year, the Health Department ordered 150,000 doses of 4-valent influenza vaccine for 2018-2019, giving priority at this stage to free vaccination for high-risk persons, and providing vaccinations at health centres and health posts under the authority of the Health Department, especially from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on the National Day holiday (1 and 2 October).
In addition to the above-mentioned outreach measures, health centres and health posts under the Health Service have, since the launch of the programme, been extended to 8 p.m. on Mondays to Fridays. As of 30 September at 4 p.m., 4,158 people have been vaccinated, up from 3,714 in the same period last year.
Free vaccinations are provided to the following Macao residents: 6 months to 18 years of age, persons aged 50 years and over, pregnant women, all chronically ill persons, including those who are obese (i.e. BMI with a body quality index of 30 or more), as well as institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, all health workers, and Macao residents working in lottery playgrounds.
At the same time, other persons, including the public sector, deemed necessary for vaccinations by the Health Service, will contact the relevant agencies on their own initiative to obtain a list of such vaccinations, which will be arranged by the health centre.
In order to facilitate the vaccination of the inoculations and the reduction of the waiting time of the province, the Health Department will send medical personnel to Hong Kong ' s secondary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries between October and December this year to provide mass influenza vaccinations for young children, young and middle-school students, teachers and employees; in addition, the Health Department will arrange group vaccinations for the elderly and disabled, public sector or other institutions.
If students and young children fail to participate in group vaccinations, they can be vaccinated from 3 December 2018 on the basis of a Macao resident ' s identity card, a health office user ' s card, a influenza vaccination card, if any, a student ' s certificate, an employee ' s card or a vocational certificate at the general hospital or a health centre.
The Department of Health reminded the population that, between September 2017 and August 2018, people who had been vaccinated against influenza 2017 to 2018 would still need to be vaccinated against the new influenza season in September 2018. The antigens of influenza contained in the influenza vaccine of the northern hemisphere of 2018-2019 were updated in response to seasonal influenza in the northern hemisphere in winter 2018-2019 and summer 2019.
The peak of influenza in Macao is usually in January-March of each year, later than in temperate areas (such as northern China and Japan), and the Health Authority has called for early vaccination of those at high risk who are more vulnerable to complications from influenza, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, obesity and chronically ill, as well as those who are in constant contact with them.

Reuters Tokyo 1 October – The Japan Central Bank’s weekly short-sighted survey, published on Monday, shows that the confidence of Japan’s large manufacturing community reached its lowest level in over a year in September, owing to rising costs of raw materials and a series of natural disasters affecting production, which put pressure on businesses.
The current survey shows little evidence that escalating global trade friction has undermined the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, the risk of a full-scale trade war undermines business prospects and may threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital spending is a highlight of the Japanese economy.
The survey calls into question the JCB’s view that a robust economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to the 2% target, although there are indications that firms are gradually shifting costs to clients.
“In a climate of concern caused by the global trade war, the confidence of the manufacturing community is stagnating as a result of a slowdown in exports and weak plant production.” According to South Wuji, the chief researcher of the General Research Institute of Agroforestry, Kim Daeg.
“confidence remains high. And I don’t think that confidence will continue to decline because business profits are improving and prices are rising. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Short-term surveys show that in September, the large manufacturing industry landscape rating index declined from positive 21 three months ago to positive 19, a third consecutive season.
The median market estimate is positive 22.
In September, the large non-manufacturing climate judgement index declined from positive 24 to positive 22 in the June survey, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey is positive 22.
The survey showed that the large manufacturing and non-manufacturing weather rating indices remained stable in December.
Investors do not care about the decline in the short-term enterprise scenario index, and the Japanese stock stock index.N225 rose to 27 years of highs on Monday and helped improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese enterprises due to the continued depreciation of the yen.
Capital expenditure is robust.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest short-term outlook highlights the robustness of corporate capital expenditure plans, the benefits of upgrading production capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with labour shortages resulting from population ageing.
According to the Central Bank's short-term survey, capital expenditure by large enterprises for the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2019, increased by 13.4 per cent.
The previous short survey was 13.6%.
According to Nandu, capital spending plans for all enterprises for the fiscal year grew by 8.5 per cent, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy.
“In view of the rising profit projections for small businesses from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital spending, but this depends largely on the impact of trade wars on business confidence. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Short-term surveys of the increased ability of enterprises to transfer costs, with a positive 7 per cent output price index for large enterprises, are encouraging signs of progress in Japan ' s efforts to counter deflation.
The index measuring the employment status of large enterprises reached negative 23, the most striking level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Thanks to strong corporate spending, the second season of the Japanese economy has rebounded since the contraction of January-March this year.
However, the rise in trade friction during the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have overshadowed the prospects of the export-dependent Japanese economy.
In United States dollars, the rate of increase in the import and export of services is 16.4 per cent.

In the area of services exports, between January and August, services exports continued the rapid growth momentum since the beginning of the year, with exports growing faster than imports by 5.7 percentage points.
Of these, the three highest growth areas are telecom computers and information services, personal culture and recreation services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1 per cent, 38.8 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.
The Officer-in-Charge of the Division also noted that the share of emerging service imports had been increasing in January-August.

Westerna: Massi helped the by-elections to lay the ground.
After the 7th round of Barcelona, which was held last night, the first half of DeMarcos' goal was to help the guest team lead, and the second half of Massey was to help the Munir score, the one-to-one tie ended, after which there were three rounds of Bassa.
This is a war between Massey and Brocketts.
With the score falling behind, Macy will be in the second half.
After three rounds of the battle, and with no victory on the horse, Bassa is still at the top of the list with a net win, but the gap with Seville is only one point behind him.

The word “China” is gaining weight in the international arena.
All of this is felt more deeply by the Chinese overseas.
The success of the reform and opening-up of our homeland, and the great joy of our Chinese diaspora, is a source of pride, and I hope that our country will grow stronger.
Every time we go home, there is a huge change in the country, and more and more artists are coming out to spread Chinese culture, and I think this is a very big change.
The reform and opening of our country is absolutely a miracle for the world.

Happy Chinese National Day!
The price of oil, or the “triple rise”, could be filled with oil for the national holiday.
On September 30, Beijing (journalist Quuu), the new round of price-fixing for finished products will be opened at 2400 hours.
Many agencies forecast a substantial increase in oil prices, with a “triple rise”.
The owners of the cars planned to travel could fill them with gas before the price rises.
According to information from the public, the corresponding increase in domestic finished oils is expected to be around $190 per ton, while the increase in information from the originals is estimated at $220 per ton.
In September, oil prices had risen twice: on 3 September, gasoline had been increased by $180 per ton and diesel by $170 per ton; on 17 September, petrol had been increased by $145 per ton and diesel by $145 per ton.
Domestic oil prices have been linked to international oil prices, and since the current round of valuation cycles, international oil prices have increased and Brent's crude oil has continued to be pursued after crossing the $80 threshold.
As at 28 September, the United States WTI crude oil futures had increased by $1.13 to $73.25 per barrel.
Brent's crude oil futures increased by USD 1.0 to USD 82.72 per barrel.
“In the light of the international situation, the United States sanctions against Iran have been overstretched and oil prices have generally been on the rise, followed by the OPEC Derogation Conference, which explicitly refused to increase production, gave market confidence and steadily shifted oil prices. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Drebret Information and Oil Analysts just said:
With regard to retail sales, the current prices for petrol in Beijing for oil, Chinese petrochemical gas stations 92 and 95 are 7.66 and 8.15 yuan, respectively.
According to Yang Li, a public information analyst, there has been no significant change in the preferential promotion strategy in the retail trade of gas stations, with the current preference margin of 0.5-0.7 yuan/litre for main stations such as petrochemicals and 0.5-1.2 yuan/litre for private stations.
“The current round of retail prices is about to increase ‘triple-time,’ with an increase of about $0.14-0.16, and private car owners are advised to re-locate before the Fourth of July.” Lee said.
Primary school students are physically abused by teachers.
In response to the incident that a small student in Suining had been physically punished by a teacher, the official Weibo of the Suining city ' s new district management committee had issued a circular yesterday stating that it had been found that Roh XX, a teacher in Suzhou ' s foreign language schools, had physically disciplined students and that they had been transferred from their posts and that the schools involved had been disqualified from annual `optimal' qualifications.
According to parents, girls in the sixth grade of primary school had been beaten by class math teachers at school for making mistakes, which had caused widespread concern.
Subsequently, an investigation team was set up at a school to investigate and interview the persons concerned, gather evidence on the ground and remove the teachers involved.
Yesterday, the official Weibo of the Suining city ' s New District Control Council reported that it had been found that Roh XX, a teacher at the Suzhou Foreign Language Primary School, had physically punished students.
After a study, the "one-vote veto" of the end-of-year examinations for foreign-language schools in Suzhou was abolished.
The report also states that the administrative staff of the Suzhou Foreign Language Primary School have been subjected to collective cautionary talks, and that the management and direction of the school are governed by the relevant regulations; that the teachers involved have been transferred from their posts and taken seriously, as provided for in the relevant regulations; and that a thorough examination of the Suzhou Foreign Language Primary School has been ordered and a teacher-building campaign has been conducted to take practical measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.
At the same time, schools are required to communicate with parents on their own initiative and follow up is handled properly.
69th International Astronautical Congress Opening in Germany - New China Network
The 69th International Astronautical Congress opened on 1 October at the Bremen Exhibition Centre of Xinhua News Agency, Bremen, Germany, on October 1, with the participation of more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and businesses, expert scholars and young students from all over the world.
In his opening statement, the President of IAF, Jean-Yves Legar, said that the global space industry was no longer a small number of countries and institutions and that the number of participants had increased significantly this year over the previous session, indicating that an increasing number of institutions and individuals were joining it.
He called for greater cooperation and innovation among States to advance the space industry.
In attending the exchange, the Deputy Minister of Industry and Information Technology of China and Director-General of the National Space Agency, Zhang Kwai, introduced China ' s space programme and stated that China would expand international cooperation in space and contribute to the cause of space for mankind.
The participation of representatives of relevant institutions, such as China Aerospace Science and Technology Group, China Aerospace Technology Group and a number of private enterprises, showcased the latest achievements in Chinese space, including various launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest gathering of the world ' s aviation community.
The Congress was held over a period of five days and was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Centre for Applied Science and Technology and Microgravity Studies of the University of Bremen and the International Institute of Space Law.
Reuters Beijing, 5 November - According to a press release issued on Sunday by the China Foreign Trade Centre, the meeting revealed that China ' s foreign trade situation remained complex and critical, with 80.6 per cent of enterprises predicting better exports than in the previous year or evenly throughout 2018.
However, given the increasing costs of domestic raw materials, labour, etc., and the external environment in which trade frictions between China and the United States have increased, the performance of the participating enterprises is not considered to be promising next year.
At the closing press conference of the 124th session, the Under-Secretary-General, the press spokesman and the Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Centre, Xu Jun, stated that the number of overseas buyers and exports at the current session had fallen slightly.
The number of buyers attending the meeting was 189,812, representing 215 countries and territories, a decrease of 1.11 per cent.
Exports were contracted in the amount of RMB 206,494 million (equivalent to US$ 29,866 million), a decrease of 1 per cent over the same period.
From the market point of view, trades with Japan, the 10 ASEAN countries, the BRIC countries, and the Republic of Korea grew by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, 2.5%, and the traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada, and the European Union fell by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3%, and 0.8% respectively.
In industry, transport, mechanical equipment, construction and decoration materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, and bathing equipment increased by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent and 7.6 per cent, respectively, while textile clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively.
As a barometer and windbeam for China ' s foreign trade, Xu said that the data on the pattern of participation and export transactions of the current meeting of the traders indicate that China ' s foreign trade development will continue to face many uncertainties next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reforms and the recent introduction of national and local policy measures, such as the “Six Stable” policy, China's new dynamic of foreign trade development is accelerating its build-up and new advances in the diversification of enterprise markets are important foundations and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
“In combination, China's foreign trade imports and exports are expected to grow steadily throughout the year, with further improvements in quality and efficiency. "Seon.
China’s Customs Administration has announced that exports increased by 14.5 per cent in United States dollars in September, imports by 14.3 per cent in September, and a trade surplus of $31.69 billion in September, with the highest export growth and trade surplus since February.
Although China’s export performance in September was significantly higher than expected, despite the escalation of trade friction between China and the United States, and foreign demand booms, pre-tariff increases in the United States, and the exchange rate depreciation of the renminbi by firms, or major supporting factors, have to a certain extent demonstrated the resilience of China’s foreign trade. But the US-China trade war’s impact on confidence and the industrial chain cannot be underestimated, and analysts believe that the challenges of China’s foreign trade may become apparent in the fourth quarter or next year.
The Reuters survey showed that the United States fund manager, who had recommended an increase in cash holdings in September, continued to maintain a cautious stance, as the United States and China began the latest round of reciprocal import tariffs, with no signs of abating the dispute.
However, according to the 12 fund managers participating in the survey, North America ' s asset allocation has increased to its highest level since June 2017, while the United Kingdom, the euro zone and, in particular, emerging markets have fallen in hold.
The global equity ratio averaged 56.6 per cent, and the bond ratio 35.5 per cent, largely consistent with last month’s survey.
The most notable change was the increase in the cash ratio to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager from a large fund company said, “Some economic data bring confidence to the market, but the war on trade remains the biggest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when markets fall. It's not like it's a bad idea.
However, in September, the fund manager still preferred equities, particularly in the United States, even though United States equities were considered to be overpriced.
Today, the opening of the China International Import Fair, the world's first large-scale national-level exhibition on the subject of imports, is officially opening in China.
An exhibition is like a window that allows the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through this “window” of the Expo, people see a move towards a higher level of “open China”; and with this “window” of the Expo, the world is welcome to win with China, “reform and open again.”
“For a country, openness is like a cocoon, which will experience pain for a while, but will be a new life. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The Secretary-General, Xi Jinping, summed up the open road by saying an important reason why “China can”.
Looking back at 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which dared to enter the world market, has faced vortex and wind waves, has always faced all the risk challenges in an open-minded manner, unleashing internal dynamics and increasing competitiveness.
It can be said that China has strongly interpreted the value and significance of openness through its own achievements.
On the threshold of a new history, an import-oriented fair was a major decision taken at the center of the party, with Comrade Xi at its core, to promote a new high level of openness to the outside world. It was a major initiative by China to open its markets to the world. It was China’s practical action in support of economic globalization and trade liberalization.
The large number of candidates and the “one-size-fits-all” position are the most positive and positive responses to China’s development of an open economy on a wider, broader and deeper scale.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
The construction of a wall of trade protectionism by some countries and the return to the old path of unilateralism have increased the international community ' s concerns about the prospects for free trade and added much uncertainty to the warming world economy.
Against this backdrop, this grand gathering on the side of Huangpo reflects China ' s defence of free trade and gives the world a sense of China ' s self-confidence in opening its markets and sharing its future.
All alone and far away.
China’s open heart and embrace of the world not only strongly boosts its own development, but also creates a “China’s opportunity” for countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the establishment of a “one-way street” and launched the Asian Investment Bank and the creation of a silk road fund China has provided a series of international public goods that provide real export markets, development opportunities, and jobs, allowing enterprises to take China’s “fast-truck” to develop.
APC is also such a public good, a great platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their distinctive and high-quality products and services.
Apart from national enterprises, domestic consumers are the real beneficiaries.
This platform of “opportunity” provides a multi-channel supply of good quality and meets the demand for individualized, diversified and differentiated consumption by the population.
With the opening of China ' s doors, the flow of goods and their use, the steps towards a better life will be stronger.
From a more macro-level point of view, the significance of the Expo goes beyond economics and trade to a vision of the future that conveys the concepts of openness, inclusion, inclusiveness, balance and win-winness and forges a common understanding of the challenges of today.
The world is better for China; China is better for China.
We look forward to the success and beauty of the world at the Expo; we look forward to a brighter future in which the “open China” at a higher level joins the world in building a community of human destiny.
Foreign media: A framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The [summary] agreement includes the opening by Canada of its dairy market to the United States, as well as the temporary withholding by the United States of duties on cars produced in Canada.
According to external media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of 30 September local time that the United States and Canada had concluded a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement included the opening of Canada ' s dairy market to the United States, as well as the temporary withholding of tariffs from the United States on cars produced in Canada.
On 27 last month, the United States and Mexico announced an initial agreement in principle to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the 31 August deadline set by the United States to extend the negotiations until 30 September.
Previously, the spokesperson for Canada's Foreign Minister, Friland, said that Canada would only sign a favourable agreement, “focusing on substance rather than timetable. We will continue our consultations in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in Canada ' s national interest. It's not like it's a bad idea.
More than 90% of Brazilian female voters said that the presidential candidate did not take into account the needs of women.
According to the South American diaspora network, data released recently by the National Geographical Institute of Brazil (IBGE) indicate that more than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not believe that presidential candidates take women ' s needs into account.
It was reported that Brazil now had 107 million women and that if all of Brazil ' s women were brought together to form a country, the country ' s population would be 13th in the world, twice as many as that of Spain.
In Brazil, women accounted for 52 per cent of the electorate, while men accounted for 48 per cent. Although the percentage of women in the electorate was very high, it was only 10 per cent in the Brazilian Congress.
Brazilian women ' s participation in politics is only 154th out of 193 countries globally, higher than in Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have not succeeded in acquiring their rights.
According to the Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, this phenomenon exists as a result of the confluence of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
“Political should be citizens claiming citizenship, identity, access to public goods and the formation of a single society by multiple social groups. But Brazilian politics is a monopoly of a certain group, and the majority of the population is not represented. It's not like it's a bad idea.
An earlier study carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Motorcycles (Loucomotiva) also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that the elected politicians were able to represent their rights, 90 per cent did not agree with the decisions taken by politicians, and 93 per cent did not agree with the current Government ' s policy of governance.
“We need to reverse the under-representation of women in parliament, and Brazil's political system continues to be affected by inequality. To date, there are still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazilian politics. Natalia Mori said.
Despite the inadequate rights of women, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 per cent of women believed that they could make a difference in democratic elections and 72 per cent were politically interested.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democracy is the best way to make women less biased.
On October 1st, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the birth of 69-year-old New China.
More than 80 representatives of all the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, the Chinese diaspora, the Confucius Academy and students in study attended.
On 1 October, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the birth of 69-year-old New China.
Following the flag-raising ceremony, Ambassador Zhang Xian of China stated that, on the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we held a flag-raising ceremony in other countries, which was a deeply patriotic educational event.
Although we have lived abroad for a long time, we are at the heart of our great homeland.
Zhang Xuan said that the Chinese nation today is closer than ever to the great goal of national renewal and to the centre of the world stage.
“Our mission, responsibilities and work are more honourable, demanding and onerous than ever before. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Zhang Xian stressed that, while keeping in mind its mission, it was important to move forward with the construction of the “Language” by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in a steady and far-reaching way, to produce a much more beautiful “Language” “work pen” and to devote all its energy to the development of the country and to the friendly cooperation of China.
The T2 terminal at Guilin International Airport in Guangxi was inaugurated on 30 days.
According to the Secretary-General of the CCP Guilin City, Zhao Lu Qin, the launch of the new terminal was able to meet the demand for 12 million passengers per year, building a new advantage in air traffic in Guilin, which is of great importance for the further improvement of modern stereo traffic patterns in the Guangxi River Interconnection, Sea and Steel Convergence, Land and Water and Air Terminals.
This year, it is estimated that there will be more than 90 million visitors to Guilin.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and the site support facilities at Guilin International Airport is a major public good for the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Magentang Autonomous Region and a landmark project for the construction of the Guilin International Tour resort.
The project began in December 2015, with 100,000 square metres of construction and a total investment of RMB 3,258 million, to meet the demand of 12 million passengers per year, 10.12 million trips per year and 95,000 tons per post.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal at Guilin International Airport.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by the fact that Mount Guillin is under the surface of the mountain, as if it were a mountain crown, and as if it were the landscape of the Dragon Ridge Terrace and the nesting of the population of the north of Guillin.
It was described that the new terminal at Guilin Airport was capable of meeting the peak traffic of nearly 4,000 people per hour, using smart baggage sorting systems, security integration platforms, smart airports for face recognition, etc., and planning commercial areas covering a wide range of business practices, including catering, department goods, tax exemptions and recreation.
Since growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is largely not encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming a major engine of global growth.
On 23 September 2018, a container cargo ship was docked in a port in New Jersey, United States.
However, as the current growth in the United States has benefited from the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the economy has also received close external attention.
“As the United States returns to full employment, the economic downturn is inevitable. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The only question, he said, was when it would happen, and in his view it might only be premature.
While Barclay is optimistic about the economic outlook for the United States by the end of this year, the Bank recognizes that it is more difficult to predict more distant times.
“In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, current fiscal-led growth will not be sustainable.” Barclays’s economist said in a study.
“In the absence of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing of the economy will rise by 2020”, they say.
A series of business surveys will provide an overview of the economic cycle in major economies at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and US manufacturing surveys, scheduled to be published next Monday, will receive attention, and services surveys will be published on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week’s data section will inevitably be on non-farm employment in the United States, to be published next Friday, which will provide a clue as to whether the tight employment market is driving large wage growth.
Its importance not only because of its importance to the profitability of enterprises and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because of salary jumps or overall inflation increases, may be a source of concern for officials of the United States Federal Reserve (the Federal Reserve/FED).
“Payments will be of great concern, as it is likely to increase significantly again over the previous month.
September may not be 3% higher than the same period in the previous year, but we can well expect a breakthrough next month. “In a study, the Dutch International Group (ING) economists wrote.
The political situation in Europe is likely to become a source of market volatility at a time when China and the rest of Asia are taking vacations, leading to the region ' s data being diluted next week.
The Italian Government ignores previous financial commitments to the EU, and other EU member States will have to decide quickly whether to strongly oppose Italy ' s decision. Tria did not support the decision, and he wished to adhere to the EU rules.
The annual meeting of the British Conservative Party, to be held in Birmingham, may also be splattered as the British exit talks enter a critical phase.
At the same time, fears surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to diminish with Brazil’s much-awaited presidential election next weekend.
[Summary] When completed, the ship will be delivered to the East Sea Subdirectorate of China ' s State Oceanic Administration, and Chen Zhui, Head of the Observation Service of the Ocean Early Warning Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, indicated that it would be of great importance for the development of China ' s offshore ocean observing system and the advancement of global ocean observations.
On 29 September, China's first 3,000-ton-class large buoy ship, Yinghong 22, was brought into the China Waqf Group.
When completed, the ship will break the current Chinese equipment bottlenecks in large-scale buoys, sub-platforms, recycling and recovery.
The Sun-Red 22 wheel is used mainly for the maintenance of regular buoys/submarine patrols, periodic emplacement, recycling, buoys/submarine emergency placement, recycling, recovery and repair, as well as for the capacity to carry out integrated marine survey missions such as fault surveys.
The total size of the new ship is 89 metres wide and 7.2 metres deep, with a continuation of 10,000 nautical miles.
The Deputy General Manager of the WVG, Wang Wei-ju, stated: “The fact that the first ship in the country is Yinghong and the only one in the country with the capacity to lift 10 metres of large buoys will further enhance our capacity to secure large buoys. It's not like it's a bad idea.
It is understood that the ship will be put at the disposal of the East China Sea Subdirectorate of the State Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Zhui, Director of the Observation Division of the Ocean Early Warning Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, indicated that the launch of the ship would be of great importance for the development of China ' s offshore ocean observing system and the advancement of global ocean observations.
“This ship, which also has a large buoy-laying maintenance operation and an integrated marine investigation capability, is the first comprehensive vessel in our country dedicated to mid-middle sea buoy operations and integrated marine investigations.
With such buoy ships, our future ocean observations and investigations will have a powerful instrument. It's not like it's a bad idea.
On October 1st, China's new net island electricity was affected by Typhoon Sun-mi, when the first day of the race was postponed until October 1 at the “Maser Yuncin Cup” of the 2018 series of international extreme sailboats scheduled for the 30th of September, and a pre-selection meeting at the Qingdao Centre, in which the captains of the 12 water-wing dhow fleet from six countries and territories were brought to light.
As a result of Typhoon Tamings, strong winds continued in Hong Kong, with the maximum wind speed being as high as 24 knots, the launch signal was delayed for nearly 90 minutes from 1 p.m. on 30 p.m., the wind speed remained constant, and the general referee, Anne Mdrant, announced the cancellation of the first day's competition, delaying it until the afternoon of 1 October.
“The strong wind from the shore continues, and the sea is so intense. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Mdrand explained: “In this case, no one knows when the wind will strike the boat.
Close to the city, cancellation is the wisest option in the current climate. It's not like it's a bad idea.
There are still some disappointments for all ready crews.
"The boat is ready to stop and we're in good shape. It's not like we're going anywhere.
Aoshima's rudder, Max Richardson, said, "But I know that a reschedule is the right choice, and I hope today's wind is smaller and we can do it." It's not like it's a bad idea.
As Omica Wilkinson, known as the New Zealand Star of Hope at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, says: "The loss of a day makes the game more interesting.
Because today's game is going to increase and there's only two days left.
You're going to be so hard. It's not like we're going anywhere.
Despite the wind, the French ABM rudder Pierre Ives Durand appealed before the race about his warmth with Qingdao: five years ago, the international limit-boat series suffered accidental injuries and fractured muscles, and it was thanks to the handling of the local medical team that he was able to stand up today five years later.
It has been learned that the international limit sailboat series was launched in 2007 as a world sail contest with the name Volvo, the Cup of the Americas, the World Contest Tour, etc.
The Flying Phantom is to be used for the Aoshima Station competition.
In 2018, the event was the eighth year since the event had landed on Qingdao, the capital of the sailboat, and the Qingdao station was also the winner of the series.
Despite the worldwide financial market shocks, the Hong Kong Financial Authority reported on Monday that the foreign exchange fund's investment revenue in the third quarter of this year was reduced by 97 per cent annually, but was better than it was in the previous quarter, and that foreign exchange losses had been significantly reduced as a result of the increase in overseas stocks during the US-China trade war.
According to the latest data of the Authority, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$ 1.6 billion in July-September 2018, significantly lower than the HK$ 61.8 billion recorded during the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$ 100 million for the second quarter of this year.
Managing Director Chen Deok-hoon stated in the Legislative Assembly that, at the beginning of the trade war between China and the United States, the Hong Kong and emerging market equity indices ran counter to the United States equity indices, and that market sentiment had begun to reverse until late September and early October, when the United States stock market index peaked, as investors became aware that the trade war would be detrimental to the United States itself.
“A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if trade wars have only unilateral effects, they do not help much to solve the problem. It's not like it's a bad idea.
At the same time, he pointed out that “if the US-China trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise. It's not like it's a bad idea.
During the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund ' s equity investment deficit in Hong Kong was between HK$ 8 per cent and HK$ 4.7 billion lower than in the previous quarter, while the foreign exchange deficit was between HK$ 172 and HK$ 12.8 billion, while the bond gain was between HK$ 16.2 billion and HK$ 9.7 billion, representing a 24 per cent and 31 per cent decline, respectively, by the quarter, mainly reflecting the general increase in the dollar ' s interest rate against major currencies within the season and the 3% drop in the United States rate in mid-September.
Foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Since 1983, Hong Kong has had a system of exchange rates linked to the dollar.
With regard to Hong Kong ' s current financial situation, Chen Deok-hyun claims that while economic and asset market uncertainty has increased and downside risks have increased, Hong Kong ' s financial system is robust and defensive and has adequate resilience to earthquakes.
“Hong Kong has a strong international investment position, with a net external asset of $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, 2.5 times more than Singapore and 0.6 times more than Japan, and is more than able to cope with the down-cycle or reversal of the economy. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The recent recovery of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate and the expansion of the United States dollar spread noted that Hong Kong dollar exchange rates had risen by more than 400 basis points on 21 September, that the market was generally considered to be mainly associated with the increase in the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, and that the subsequent swing of the Hong Kong dollar against the United States dollar in the vicinity of 7.80-7.84, and that the recent recovery of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate and the widening of the spread with the United States dollar could attract more market sales and dollar-buying arbitrage activities, leaving the Hong Kong dollar with a greater chance to trigger weaker exchange guarantees than in the previous period.
However, in his view, as the Hong Kong Bank ' s interest rate normalizes as it begins its interest cycle, future Hong Kong dollar interest rates below the dollar will change.
“Hong Kong dollar interest rates will be more consistent with the United States dollar, and you must manage risks more carefully and be prepared to cope with market fluctuations. It's not like it's a bad idea.
As the Hong Kong dollar is well-funded, the Hong Kong dollar has fallen further, falling from 0.9% to 2.08179% per week in three months, and the difference with the United States dollar has increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month rate has been reduced by five months, from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was close to 7.85 to $1 for most of the time.
During this period, a weak exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August, following the initial trigger in April, as a result of, inter alia, arbitrage activities and the partial outflow of funds from large units after the closure of their activities.
The Authority buys and sells the dollar at the 7.85 level in order to maintain the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate stability.
The Authority purchased approximately HK$52.1 billion in May and August under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Does the new tax code have any advantages for foreigners?
In response to a query from journalists, the concerned head of the Ministry of Finance and the Directorate of Tax Administration indicated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao, would be considered in the next steps to implement the new Personal Income Tax Act.
It was questioned by journalists that the new revised Personal Income Tax Act had adjusted the criteria for the determination of taxpayers of our individual income tax residents from one year to 183 days.
Are there any preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao, in the next implementation of the Act?
In response, the Officer-in-Charge stated that the regulations in force for the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Act provide for special advantages for the taxation of persons outside China, and that persons who do not have residence in China but live for a period of more than one year and less than five years, who derive their income from outside China, may pay personal income tax only in respect of the portion paid by units or individuals in China.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons outside Hong Kong, including Hong Kong/Australians, would be considered in the next steps to implement the new Personal Income Tax Act.
No “thresholds” for the Moon Centre: Quality certification leads to higher quality.
With the growth of the “two-child economy” and the boom in the market for mothers and children, from the northwards to the cities on the 3rd and 4th Lines, a variety of places have been set up.
At the time, the fire-ridden Tsukiko Society met the consumption needs of the population, at a cost ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, but at the same time was in an awkward position where there was no threshold and there was a gap in supervision.
The National Directorate of Market Supervision recently launched a series of national “quality months” in 2018, in which journalists visited a five-star Moon and Son Centre in Tianjin City to visit the certification of mother and child care services.
The general Moon and Son Centre provides services such as neonatal care, nutritional feeding and post-partum plastic repair.
At the Tsukiko Centre, journalists observed that nurses check daily for newborns to breastfeed and that skilled care for newborns is provided by a professional nurse.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, the services range from primary and post-mutual care to physical care, and care programmes such as Chinese medical treatment and beauty care to help mothers recover their position.
One of the new mothers in the house told the journalist that she had not scheduled her visit until eight months earlier.
The services provided by the Society directly affect the comfort and physical recovery of the mother during the period of her life, and some of the smaller establishments provide only a few simple sibling services, with risks such as poor hygiene, high risk of cross-infection and a single unscientific diet.
The head of the Tsukiko Centre stated that they were the only five-star Moon and Son centres in Tianjin city to have received B-status service certification.
“Although some clients initially did not understand the meaning of B-level certification, it was important for the long-term development of the enterprise to benefit from rigorous and standardized process management of the enterprise through certification.”
Pan Lifan, Deputy Director of the Accreditation Regulatory Department of the General Directorate of State Markets, said that certification of services was a new certification system based on customer perception, concern for organizational quality management and service satisfaction. It was an important component of the national quality infrastructure and had a positive impact on increasing the share of quality service provision and enhancing the international competitiveness of Chinese services.
From 2004 onwards, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone an all-embracing and gradual process, with the emergence of a number of influential services such as certification of financial services, certification of mother and child care services, certification of after-sale services, certification of e-commerce services, certification of health services, etc.
According to the National Directorate of Market Supervision, there are currently over 130 service certification bodies, over 2,000 service certification officers and nearly 8,000 valid certifications.
Pan Livin indicated that further guidance and promotion of service certification is needed to gradually expand service certification coverage in areas such as health, education, sports, finance, electricity, etc., and contribute to service supply-side reform and quality improvement.
On Monday, Hong Kong's Financial Authority President Chen Deok-hyun stated that it would take time to observe whether the building had entered its next cycle and, if confirmed, to consider the appropriate time to ease the tightening of countercyclical measures.
Chen Deok-hwan also pointed out that if the prices were to be reversed, the first impact would be on those who would be working at the peak of the market, but that the prospect of a sharp fall in the prices of the building, such as the Asian financial storm in 1997, and the opportunity for citizens to cut prices for the sale of property would be much lower.
During a briefing to the Legislative Council, Chen Deok-chun led a number of senior members of the Authority, saying that if the market were to enter a falling cycle, it would be possible to relax measures in due course.
“But only a few weeks of data are available, and it is still too soon to relax, and more time is still needed to see if the market is moving into the next cycle. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Since October 2009, the Authority has so far introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages in a variety of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages and having to pass rigorous stress tests to improve bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest-rate cycle, the price index for private residential buildings in Hong Kong peaked for two months in August-September, with a monthly fall of 1.44 per cent in September.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of the year was 10.2%.
According to the Authority, the financial position of households that measure Hong Kong ' s resilience to financial risks remains healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households living in their own homes without mortgages reached 66 per cent, which is higher than the average of 60 per cent in 2009-11; the average number of mortgages released and the ratio of contributions to interest earned on new mortgages was 47 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively, a marked improvement from 64 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, in 2009-11.
However, Chen Deok-hyun stated that the high capacity to withstand earthquakes did not mean that already employed citizens would not be harmed by economic downturns, as property valuation would fall and those who bought buildings at peaks would bear the brunt.
Although the Superintendency tightens bank lending to mortgage lenders, the builders may also obtain high mortgage lending through mortgage insurance or mortgage lending by developers.
Chen Deok-chun stated that borrowers could have a mortgage of 85 to 90 per cent, together with mortgage lending to developers, and that negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property fell below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loan) would occur if the building price fell by 10 per cent.
However, the Vice-President of the Authority, Nguyen Guo-chun, pointed out that the authorities estimated that the high number of mortgages provided by developers represented only 2-2.5 per cent of the total bank mortgages and remained low.
At the peak of negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, or 22 per cent of those providing the building.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets in seven consecutive seasons.
On October 1st, Xinhua's electronic commerce retail export company Liu Hongxia, Mahi received another wave of tax returns on October 1 and related to value added tax and excise tax exemptions.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Tax Administration, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Customs Administration have recently issued a joint communication clarifying the export of goods to the Equivalent Power Company of the Zone of Integrated Cross-border Electronic Commerce for which valid import certificates have not been obtained, as well as the piloting of the VAT, excise tax exemption policy, if the following conditions are met.
First, e-commerce exporting enterprises are registered in the test zone and the export date, name of goods, unit of measure, quantity, unit price, amount are registered on the platform of integrated services on the cross-border electronic commerce line at the place of registration.
Second, the export of goods is subject to the electronic commerce export declaration procedure through the customs office where the test area is located.
Thirdly, exported goods are not those of the Ministry of Finance and the General Tax Administration which, by decision of the State Council, expressly eliminates export refunds (exempted).
The circular clearly states that the General Customs Administration regularly transmits electronic information on e-commerce export declaration lists to the National Tax Administration.
The tax authorities of the pilot regions have strengthened the tax-free management of export goods on the basis of electronic information on the export goods declaration list, which is drawn up by the National Tax Administration Directorate.
The circular states that specific tax-exempt management schemes are developed by the provincial tax authorities in the financial and commercial sectors.
The offices of the leadership groups and business authorities of the CMA should work together to promote inter-sectoral communication and related policy implementation, accelerate the establishment of a statistical monitoring system for e-commerce exports, and promote the healthy development of cross-border e-commerce.
On November 5th, China New Net Ordos (Zhang Linhu) split the distribution of money, and a man in Liaoning province killed his lover and dumped him, then fled to the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia.
On 5 May, journalists were informed by the Public Security Bureau of the East Shogun district of the city of Ordos, Inner Mongolia, that the man had been successfully captured following a joint police investigation in both locations.
On 26 June 2018, a woman disappeared in the city of Sadsan, Liaoning province, and her family called the local police.
As a result of a police investigation, this is not a simple case of disappearance of a person, who is at great risk of being killed by one of the lovers, the police set up a special unit to conduct further investigations.
On 30 October, the task force found that the suspect Wang was likely to be hiding in the eastern Shogun district of Ordos city and that the Dong Shing police immediately organized a competent police force to cooperate fully with Liaoning police in the investigation of the case.
After five days of investigation, the civilian police finally identified Wang Yi ' s location and conducted a detailed mapping of his associates.
On 4 November, the two police forces jointly arrested the suspect Wang at an excavator fittings shop in Dong Shing District.
According to Wang, he was in a relationship with the victim, who had decided to take possession of the money because his sister had a large sum of money that she had left behind.
On 22 June 2018, Wang and Baek Hoi, who had been divided over the disposition of the money, subsequently killed him in a rental house, dissected the body and dumped it.
Currently, the suspect Wang has been transferred to the Liaoning Mount Police.
Green development on the action train line
The second column of the theme train, "The Five Developments, the Goodest Emblems", - the theme train "Green Development in Action" came online on the fifth day.
In order to give a full picture of the remarkable results of the construction of the Five Developments, Good Peace Marks, Hoi Fat Market Track and Kim Chang Media Technology developed a series of theme trains.
Among them, the first train - the “Innovative Development in Action” theme train - was officially launched on October 1st, on line 1 of the Hofer Market Orbital Traffic Line.
The theme train on the line picked the blue and green tone of mountain water, reflecting the birth machine, vitality and purity.
The message highlighted the core philosophy of the Five Developments, the Greatest Emblems, and the 18 representative examples of green development results in the province, including those from key green development projects such as the River Canal Project, the Forest Master System, the Yangtze Economic Zone Conservation Development and the Forest Growth Project.
In addition, the “Coordination of Development in Action”, “Open Development in Action” and “Sharing Development in Action” thematic trains will also be on line in the near future.
On October 1st, the first day of the Chinese National Day “Golden Week” and the last day of public holidays in the Mainland, many Mainlanders used their holidays to travel and shop abroad, and many deep-seated Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong on that day. In Shenzhen border crossings, there have been “blasts” in the flow of passengers. Twenty-two new self-help routes have been opened at Rok and Shenzhen Bay ports to improve customs efficiency and facilitate efficient and rapid clearance for passengers.
According to data provided by the Shenzhen Border Post, as of 16 p.m., the Shenzhen port had more than 429,000 exits and exits, and the number of transport vehicles had reached more than 168,000 (boats, racks, columns). The ports had been busy and had maintained a good order of entry and exit.
It is understood that, as a result of a number of positive factors, including the increase in the number of countries providing exit waivers for Chinese citizens, the number of tourists travelling on national holiday to countries such as Europe and South-East Asia continues to increase.
In the early morning hours of the day, passenger flows peaked in the direction of departures from the ports of Lok, Shenzhen Bay, Shenzhen and Fukuda, where they continued from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and Shenzhen Bay from 6.30 a.m. to 13 noon.
It was explained that, in response to the peak in the flow of passengers (cars) to and from the country, Shenzhen Border Control Station, in accordance with the unified deployment of the National Immigration Administration, launched a bus-flow peak-hour service model, arranged for overtime police to support the line of duty, and provided an advance check-in route to guide passengers and vehicles to and from the country in order to ensure that Chinese citizens were in line for entry/exit clearance for no more than 30 minutes, taking into account the efficiency of customs clearance for foreigners; and strengthened the maintenance of order in densely populated areas to ensure the safe and orderly passage of customs.
At the same time, the Shenzhen Border Post reminds passengers entering and leaving the country of the validity of their documents and visas, the validity of their bets, the rational organization of their journeys, avoiding as much as possible the peak hours of their traffic, and the choice of the appropriate time and port.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong by the Guang Dynasty are required to have valid entry/exit documents and visas. If they are unable to travel to Hong Kong for reasons such as non-conformity of the documents, they must wait at a designated location for the staff of the Hong Kong Railway Company to take them back to the Mainland.
Systemic red hemorrhoids are a chronic problem with exhausting and full-body organs, which in the past had been considered as an incurable disease.
Because of the lack of a clear mechanism for the onset of the disease, it is difficult to treat it and the lack of an effective treatment is not an option.
In recent days, a joint team of researchers from the University of Qinghua School of Life Sciences, Liu Wanli, and the Director of the Rhodwe Immunization Centre of the Beijing People ' s Hospital, Chestnut, have discovered the presence of molecular variations in human immunoglobin proteins that increase the systemic vulnerability to erythrocyte, and the involvement of this variant in the management of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams have confirmed that an abnormal immunokin in the human body is an important cause of systemic haemophiles.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaoxiang, Grand Norte People ' s Hospital, the team of Chestnuts collected and studied nearly 2,000 large samples of systematic erythalamus and found that patients with immunoglobin mutation had a wide range of pathogenesis and a large number of their own antibodies, and that there had been a significant increase in the incidence and severity of diseases such as renal, arthritis, meningitis and vascular disease.
Through various research methods, including immunocellular trace, animal testing, sequencing and so forth, the Liu Wanri team found that this immuno-molecule mutation activates the immuno-signal route and promotes a mechanism for the spread of multiple self-antibodies.
Journalists have learned that the two teams are strongly united, taking full advantage of each other, and that they are closely linked to basic research and clinical applications.
The Liu Wanli team is committed to the Blymphocyte Immunology and Immunoactivity study, while the Chestnut Country team has long been engaged in systematic clinical research on red weeds.
“The study is one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams and is the first time that the academic community has been institutionally aware that immunoglobin genetic abnormalities will induce systemic red and hyenas, providing a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeting. It's not like it's a bad idea.
It is not short-lived, it is legal.
A lawyer with an axe in court?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it blew up in the legal sphere.
The Central Law of Fujian Quan County subsequently fined the lawyers involved $500 and recommended in writing that the Bar Association of Quan Quan District investigate the matter.
According to Ninkyo, the former Quan City Bar issued an official circular stating that the lawyers ' actions did not involve violations of the law and were not punishable by law.
According to multiple reports, the Quantuan City Bar Association did not deal with short-term or confrontations, but was endorsed by the Quantuan Central College.
An incident that could have triggered tensions within the legal community was eventually properly resolved.
This reversal stems from a more complete return to the truth: the axe that the lawyer in question carried was of the same type and type as the murder weapon of the accused, but it was not opened, it was supported by evidence only at the level of proof, and there was no intimidation or the subjective intention of “dangering the security of the court”.
There are four very important details to determine whether the lawyer in question acted in violation of the law: first, the local court held two previous sessions, where only an ax photo was shown, and where it was necessary from the point of view of the defence; second, the axe was purchased only one hour before the hearing, not because counsel was unwilling to seek the consent of the judge, but because it was objectively not reached the judge; third, the whole ax was not used excessively or improperly; and fourth, the lawyer in question made a public error at the first time and apologized to the court.
Taken together, it can be seen that the lawyer in question “had an ax in court” is not guilty, but merely a defence.
After clarifying the whole story, Quanzhou City Bar did not push the water, but instead took a decision not to punish them.
This decision is subject to the test of fact and law.
As for bringing to court an axe as a control knife without the permission of the court, there is a real risk of confusion and misunderstanding.
For security and due diligence, the previous fine penalties and judicial recommendations of the Central Court of Quan County are also inexorable.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and to prevent individual courts from harassing lawyers, the Supreme Law issued in 2014 the Rules on Security of the Judicial Police of the People ' s Court, which establish the principle that a lawyer ' s appearance before a court does not require a physical examination.
Since the issuance of the Rules, lawyers at large have led by example, and there have been few incidents where the security of the Tribunal has been compromised by security loopholes.
In rare cases such as Spring County, misunderstandings can easily be dispelled if they are communicated in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulatory organization of the profession, has the dual mission of penalizing misconduct and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual CSTOs have suffered from ill-health due to their bias towards discipline.
The decisions of the Quantuan Bar Association, in terms of both process and outcome, are commendable and set an example for more of the Association ' s proper functioning.
On October 1st, which taxes will affect our money bags?
The new Personal Income Tax Act of 1 October (Reporter Sang-hoon) of the Xinhua Society in Shanghai will be in effect as of 1 January 2019. In order to enable the population at large to benefit from the tax relief bonus as soon as possible, as of 1 October, the actual salary earned by taxpayers will be deducted at the starting point of $5,000 per month and the new scale will apply.
With the New Deal coming to the ground, what are the advantages that will affect the people's money bags?
Good one: the tax deductions for salaries are clear
Taxpayers who receive wages after 1 October can deduct the basic deduction of $5,000 per month and apply the new scale, with most taxpayers having different degrees of tax relief, especially for low- and middle-income earners.
According to the tax deduction tables for the different income groups, the monthly income after the deduction of the “three-risk one” amounts to $8,000, $10,000, $20,000 and $50,000, respectively, and the tax liability amounts to $90, $290, $1590 and $9090 respectively. The corresponding tax deductions were 73.9 per cent, 61.1 per cent, 49.0 per cent and 18.8 per cent, respectively, compared with the starting point of $3,500.
It is worth noting that, for holiday reasons, the new basic cost deduction and tax scale could be applied to the salaries that were legally due in October at the end of September.
To this end, the customer withholding software used by the tax authorities has been uniformly promoted to provide the corresponding tax calculation functionality, but the corresponding tax has to be declared within the statutory filing period.
Proximity two: Low tax brackets are significantly larger
In addition to raising the threshold, the new scale will apply as of 1 October.
The seven-segment rate for salaries and salaries has remained unchanged, but there has been a marked change in the tax scale, with a marked increase in the range of 3 per cent, 10 per cent, 20 per cent, and 25 per cent of the lower-segregation rate, while the margins of the higher rates of 30 per cent, 35 per cent, and 45 per cent remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusts the tax rates of the earnings from production operations, with the lower limit of 35 per cent of the maximum range rising from $100,000 to $500,000.
This means that individual business owners and individual partnerships will benefit from tax changes.
“As seen in the measurement of individual tax cuts by Shanghai taxpayers in the previous period, the dividends of the tax reform will be fully felt by the vast majority of taxpayers, particularly by the middle- and low-income groups. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The head of the personal income tax division of the Shanghai City Tax Office of the State Tax Administration stated that she was not a member of the Board.
Three: tax services are easier to optimize
Since the publication of the new Personal Income Tax Act, the Shanghai City Tax Administration has carried out a series of extensive tax advocacy initiatives.
On the one hand, “one-on-one, one-on-one” policy counselling is provided to priority tax sources and to priority enterprises.
The Tax Administration of the District of Pudong visited large enterprises such as Apple Trading (Shanghai) Ltd., Paying Bao (China) Network Technology Ltd., Red Star and Kaylon Homes Group Inc., which have a large number of employees, high withholding workloads, high tax rates, active counselling by the tax authorities, and questions and questions. The Tax Administration Department of Xuxiang District visited the region ' s large labour enterprises, such as Chile Finance Consulting Ltd. and China Chishang Economic and Technical Cooperation, to gather business concerns in a timely manner, respond to business claims and address business difficulties.
On the other hand, the tax policy is “full, multi-dimensional and stereotypic” for a wide range of taxpayers.
Use the official tax website of Shanghai, Twitter, Twitter and other channels to deliver policy hot spots in time to ensure that policy advocacy is in place.
At the same time, since 28 September, the Shanghai Tax Micro-Investigation Public has been making use of the 12366 Smart Consultation Platform, which conducts an integrated “target-oriented” individual tax reform information service through the “Advanced + Smart” Tax Service.
On the evening of Beijing time, 4 November, the Network officially announced that the former Captain of England, Rooney, would return to England's national team and fight for the United States on November 15.
Last August, Rooney announced his withdrawal from the England National Team.
Rooney had previously made 119 field trips on behalf of the England team, scored 53 goals, the team's first-time shooter and the second-ever.
According to a report published by the British Dare Network, this game with the United States was to raise funds for Rooney's children's charity foundation, and Rooney himself was very excited: “It is a pleasure to be in Wembley again to represent England and thank Sosgate and the British General for inviting me to help my foundation.
This is the greatest honor of my career, the 120th time, and the last time I'll be here for England, and it will be a special memory for me. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The annual Festival of Crab Culture and Tourism in the Yangtze Lake began on the 30th day, and according to the Secretary-General of the Ba'a Township Party, Guo Wenhua, the town's Krabby Economy is currently worth nearly $3.8 billion annually, with net gains exceeding $600 million.
The Krabs are also known as the Golden Claw Crabs, who are known as the Crabs without mud, the Crabs of Clean Water, the husks, and the anointed meat.
It is common practice to eat crabs in the golden autumn season.
The Krabs are the most famous icon in the city.
Crabshells, crab feet, crab meat, crab scabs. Eaters feel the beauty of being in Gangnam.
The Krabs Farmer Kim Wei explained that this year more eaters will spend more time in the city of Pasha, by the plume of the smoke, by the sun, by the gills, by the sun and by the sun, by the crab grab and by the slow-paced waterfield.
As a result of the widespread introduction of large-scale seedlings in the town of Pakistan, this year the crabs are much larger than before.
Crab farmers, who have been dealing with crabs for almost 20 years, are planning to export crab seedlings and farming techniques from the maggots to Thailand, so as to allow water-fed communities to eat across national borders and promote cultural exchanges with overseas foods.
The town of Quincy is a cultural brand in the city.
At present, the city has built up up to 1,300 hotels and restaurants with crabs, fisherlights, Spring and Fall City, Lake Crab City, the Krabby Market of Zhengyuba, and food and food, and has become a unique scenery for the various colours of crabs in the series.
Guo Wenhua explained that “a crab” attracts nearly 3 million visitors per year, both within and outside the sea, and forms the old city street, which is two-sided and fragrance.
Many tourism products, such as the Quincai Post Office, the collection of concept books, the Pinkbread Theme Gallery, the Quincai Theme People's Home, the Embroidery Palace, the Flag Cloak House, and so on, are visible. A group of famous people's studios, such as the Quincai scholar Yang Zhong, the flute master Chen Dongbao, the famous Quincai Xiaobing Forest, the maestro Qian Qiang Qiang Qiang Qiang Qiang Ziang Ziang, and the Qiang Zian Ziang Zheng Ziang Ziang Ziang Ziang Zheng City, have been established.
It has been learned that during the Krabs Cultural Tour Festival, the fourth Quincy town of Bay City Chongyang will be inaugurated again, and the world's competitors will be gathered to relive the mountain.
A number of cultural venues will also be unveiled, such as the historical and cultural exhibition centre of the city, the Quincai corridor, the Abyssam Palace, the Zhong Zhong Zhong Zhong Dynasty Theatre, and will present the cultural charisma of the Quincai village, the Chinese calligraphy village, and the Gangnam fish and rice village.
A tripartite trade agreement between the United States and the United States of America would open up new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Friland and United States trade representative Laedhezer, published on the Canadian Government website, states that the United States, Canada and Mexico have reached a tripartite trade agreement, which will be known as the “USMCA” (the USMCA) agreement.
Previously, CTV News, Canada, citing senior United States sources, stated that Canada and the United States had overcome their differences and reached agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quoted two well-informed sources who reported that the 30 September agreement between the United States and Canada would retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a tripartite trade agreement and that the heads of the three countries would sign a new agreement within two months.
The statement stated: “Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement – the US-Mega Trinational Accord – that will provide high standards for our workers, farmers, and companies, which will lead to freer markets, fairer transactions, and more sustainable economic growth. The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs and open up new opportunities for some 500 million people. It's not like it's a bad idea.
It is known that the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
Following the inauguration of the President of Trump, plans were announced to reconsider the agreement and sign a new one.
The three countries began this negotiation process in 2017.
The results of the early Okinawa office election, which resulted from the death of Yoon Yuji, a former director, were published in the early morning hours of local time, and Danny Jade, who opposed the planned relocation of the United States military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The results of the elections, which were conducted on 30 September, show that Jade City won a total of 396.632 million votes, with the largest number of votes in Okinawa County’s election history, with more than 80,000 votes more than Saki Sun, its main opponent.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 per cent, a decrease of 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 election of governors in Okinawa County.
On 1 January, Jade City stated to the media that the results of the elections showed that the people of the county did not want to let the authorities inform him of the waste of his efforts, that he would inherit his legacy and that he would continue to work with the Governments of Japan and the United States to oppose the plan for the relocation of the United States military base and the closure of the Universal Base.
The U.S. military base in Yino Bay, Okinawa County, which has been suffering from a long history of ill health, was previously agreed by the Japanese and American Governments to relocate it to an ancient area of the city, but there was strong opposition from the population of Okinawa in the hope of moving the base out of Okinawa.
On the other hand, with regard to the relocation plan, which was strongly opposed by the people of the county, and the withdrawal of the request for permission to land in the open coast, Yu City stated that he had not initially taken a stand against and divided with the central Government, and hoped that a full exchange of views would be held between the two sides, showing the intention to resolve the dispute through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also stated to the media in the morning that he took this outcome seriously and would make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and ease the burden on the base.
At a press conference held on 1 January, Japanese civil servant Yiwei said that there had been no change in the Government ' s approach to the relocation of United States military bases as soon as possible.
At the same time, he expressed his desire to meet with Jade City.
Yu City will officially assume office as Governor of Okinawa County on 4 this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China ' s demand for oil seeds grew, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota farmer in the United States, grew growing soybeans in his land.
This transition peaked this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, on a scale never seen before.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to replant, by 2019, the staple crops of the former American agricultural zone: maize and wheat.
For the first time in 35 years, United States farmers have grown more soybeans than maize this year.
The planned conversion of other food crops was due to the difficulties faced by United States farmers in selling soybeans in the context of the trade war launched by United States President Trump against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of United States exports of soybeans, but in recent months, trade wars have led to almost zero purchases of soybeans, resulting in soybeans prices falling to 10 years of low prices.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas says that soybean prices “have hit us hard”.
He stated that the spot price of soybeans in the vicinity of his farm was $7.10 per bot, while the necessary price for the cost of coverage was $8.50.
Farmers in the United States have reached record levels of soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to be record high.
At such a time when they were vulnerable to shocks, they were hit by trade wars.
In July, China imposed import duties on imports of United States soybeans in response to Trump ' s tariff on imports of Chinese goods.
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue a first estimate of the area to be planted next year, which will presumably include considerations of tariff implications.
The estimate is expected to confirm the anticipated reduction in soybean seeding by private institutions.
According to a report seen by Reuters, on 19 October, Informa Economics projected an increase of 4 to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in maize cultivation in 2019 and a reduction of 7 to 83 million acres in soybeans cultivation.
Informa also projects a 4 per cent increase in wheat cultivation in the United States.
The area of soybeans planted before retaliatory tariffs had been imposed had risen to 89.6 million acres this year, some 15 million more than 10 years ago.
The area under maize cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 89.1 million acres, and this year the area under wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres, the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, President of the Illinois Corn Growing Association, owns a total of 3,600 acres, and this year almost half of him is working on soybeans, but plans to reduce it in the future.
He claims that he may have increased maize cultivation by up to 20 per cent on his farm in northern Illinois, the largest soybean growing state in the United States.
Soybean production per acre is lower than maize, but less fertilizer is required, which makes soybean cultivation generally less expensive.
The transfer of farmers to the end value of maize may increase costs, but will benefit a number of enterprises, including Andersons Inc. fertilizer vendors.
Executive Director Andersons Pat Bowe indicated to Reuters that he expected that the conversion of maize would facilitate fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of maize to farmers.
A press conference was held on 29 September at Sutilawa, Director General of the Airport Authority of Bangkok, Thailand, to apologize for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and to say that Thailand welcomed Chinese tourists and that the authorities concerned would strengthen management, raise awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
It was reported that, on 27 January, the security guard at the airport at Chanman had a physical conflict with a Chinese man who had been denied entry.
Sutilava stated that the security services had been seriously insubordination and had been suspended by the Airport Authority and that a commission of inquiry had been established in accordance with procedures to investigate the matter, and that the security guard would be dismissed if it was true.
The Thai Immigration Service has now arranged for the man to return to China.
Sutilawa apologized for this incident, which was detrimental to the image of Thailand, and stated that Thailand attached great importance to the matter and was willing to do its utmost to minimize the impact of the incident on hit tourists, and would send a letter of apology to the concerned individuals through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that Shimaman Airport was willing to facilitate Chinese visitors to Thailand and to establish special entry routes for Chinese tourists at the five major international airports of Thailand, namely Suwanap, Shimaman, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Hoai, in Bangkok.
He said that, as a next step, the Airport Authority would overhaul the landing area, indicate the cost of landing and improve staff quality of service and communication.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand learned of the matter, it contacted the person concerned at the first time to understand the circumstances.
At the same time, the heads of the Thai Immigration Service, the Airports Administration and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports have made representations to the Thai authorities to investigate the incident thoroughly and to punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side to deal with the matter properly and to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the persons concerned.
Xinhua International Times Review: Defence of Multilateralism, China One.
The international rules and the multilateral order are under attack at a time when unilateralism is inverse.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible Power, China has joined the international community in preserving multilateralism and promoting its continued progress, with the concept of grandeur, juxtaposition and firm and vigorous action.
In the face of new challenges in the new situation, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As Wang Yi, Secretary of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should be based on a cooperative and win-win approach, a rule-based order based on equity and justice as its main purpose and guided by effective action.
At the same time, China called for the establishment of a global development cooperation landscape, with the United Nations at its core, with North-South cooperation as the main channel, complemented by South-South cooperation, and for all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China ' s reflections and voices reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As President Espinosa of the 73rd session of the General Assembly said, “the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism and preserve a rules-based international system”.
The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Lagarde, stated that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules and resolve differences through consultations.
In recent years, the rise of groups of emerging markets and developing countries, accompanied by adjustments in the political forces of the global economy, has played a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms and provided a new impetus for development in the face of a negative climate of multilateralism.
From this perspective, the idea of multilateralism, such as building a large family instead of a small circle, insisting on co-conforming rather than a winner-take-all, as advocated by China, is a necessary choice to address global challenges and world problems, representing the common aspirations of most of the countries of the world.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
The “one way forward” initiative of China has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives, such as the “One Way Forward”, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the “16+1 Cooperation”, to promote international regional cooperation, to perfect and complement existing international regimes and order, to bring about an innovative dynamic of multilateralism and cooperation and to contribute to the advancement of the international order towards a more just and rational development.
As the guardian of the international order and the practice of multilateralism, China ' s actions have become stronger in this multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices for international hot spots, climate change response, participation in peacekeeping operations, efforts to reduce poverty and help other countries implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the “trust deficit” facing the world increases and when populism and polarization rise, the world's need for multilateral cooperation is most urgent.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to work together to translate consensus into action, firmly defend multilateralism and jointly promote the formation of a community of human destiny.
The first national standard 4K model district in Guangdong City was unveiled on September 30 in Haiju District, Guangzhou City, on September 30, when the Guangdong wide power network officially launched 4K operations across the province and the central radio and television station 4K ultra-high-single high-resolution channel, Guangdong Province, was launched in parallel.
The event was co-sponsored by Guangdong Cable and Television Network Ltd. and the Leadership Group for Shared Social Governance in the Haijo Region.
According to the deployment of the Guangdong Provincial Council, Guangdong ' s Guangdong Guangdong Radio Network was active in the implementation of the new Digital Household 4K Action Plan, and in December 2017, the first national digital family gateway terminal product to support IPv6 and the national free-wire cash line to support 4K was released - "U point home server" (4K boxes with AVS2 standards, telephone remote control) to accelerate the construction of a new digital family model area marked by 4K ultra-high-resolution video, next-generation Internet, wireless integration network applications, and active participation in the 4K television network application model area in Guangdong Province.
In 2018, the Guangdong Wide Television Network launched a series of wide-broad power outreach initiatives and launched the “4K Service Month” to promote the “U point home server” across the province.
On the day of the event, the Guangdong Wide Television Network officially launched 4K operations across the province, and the first 4K Smart Television Home Sharing Platform based on 4K applications was officially launched and launched. The platform was developed jointly by the Office of the Leadership Group for Shared Social Governance in the Guangdong Cable and Haiju Districts, and is based on the Guangdong Wide Television Network 4K Super Clearing U-point Family Server, which provides a new generation of intelligent family services based on cable television networks and integrates government-related pro-people service functions with the aim of providing citizens with an integrated television sharing platform for services such as outreach, education, welfare, welfare and entertainment.
According to Chen Xiaochu, the chief engineer of the Guangdong Department of Press and Broadcasting, the event was a useful collaboration between the Government, which actively uses the Internet+ to build a “digital government” for the benefit of the population. It is hoped that, through cooperation and outreach, the Guangdong Network will help to build a model of shared governance in the Haiju district, Guangzhou and even throughout the province.
A new digital home application with 4K TV at its core was displayed and popularized.
The first issue of the “4K Smart Television Safe Homes Platform” will have four modules on the “Gangzhou neighbourhood”, the “New Guangzhou House”, the “Intelligence Community” and the “Intellectual Family” on the line, which will focus on exploring smart areas.
According to information received, the Guangdong free radio network is now operating five live 4K channels, which will also be broadcast exclusively by the Central Radio and Television General 4K super-highlight channels throughout the province on National Day.
The report reads as follows: 30 September is the fifth national martyr's anniversary.
On the same day, at 10 a.m., the Xi Equidad Party and national leaders joined representatives from all walks of life in the capital to attend a flower basket ceremony to honour the memory of the heroes and martyrs.
A quick review was made of this: this was the first martyr's anniversary after the implementation of our law on the protection of heroic martyrs.
Five years ago, on the eve of the national holiday, the Day of Martyrs was set up to show the Chinese nation the great journey from suffering to glory, and we must always wake up: “Where we come from, where we go.”
General Secretary Xi has pointed out in depth that “the abandonment of tradition and the loss of it is tantamount to cutting off its own lifeline”.
"History is the only way to open the future. It's not like we're going anywhere.
We honour the memory of our heroes and martyrs in order to remember history forever, with a strong spirit and a strong positive energy for national renewal.
Quick reviews point out that Young is the backbone of the nation.
To honor the martyrs and to sacrifice the martyrs is to make the mighty, holy and powerful eternal memory of our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, some 20 million martyrs have died heroically for national independence, the liberation of their people and the prosperity of their country.
Every one of those who die for his country will be remembered, and every spirit of loyalty will be looked upon.
It is in the name of the nation that national observances are organized to honour them, to pay a deep tribute to their great achievements and to learn to pass on their precious spirit of love, loyalty, selfless dedication and sacrifice.
The party committees at all levels have improved the system of preferential treatment and are constantly improving the level of such treatment, and the party and the State have acted effectively to honour the hero.
Every year, countless people look at the Martyrs' Mansion and let us experience the deep feelings of remembrance and the momentum of renewal that has risen in the blood of the nation.
It's all the way to a society where heroes are honoured, heroes are defended, heroes are taught, heroes are cared for.
The quick review concludes that today, when China’s special socialism enters a new era, we can tell the restless that a strong China is rising in the east and that the Chinese dream of the great revival of the Chinese nation is becoming a reality in our hands.
Let us march forward with a great spirit and towards a great goal!

The fifth "Disabled Voices Month" is coming in.
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but challenges remain for young people with disabilities.
Recently, a workshop on comprehensive sexuality education challenges and practical strategies for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
Sex education for disabled children and youth was an important topic of the seminar.
The Report on Sexually Related Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviours of Disabled Children and Young People in China, released at the conference, shows that children with disabilities are more exposed to sexual harassment and abuse than healthy children.
For disabled children and adolescents, social attention is also “sexual protection”.
The aim of the seminar was to promote comprehensive sexuality education for disabled children and adolescents in China in the areas of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support to disabled children and adolescents at their source so that they can enjoy the same rights to love as others.
According to the experts, public awareness of disabled groups in Chinese society has remained at a level that is not sufficiently deep.
China ' s comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents, is not sufficiently advanced, influenced by such factors as traditional attitudes.
In recent years, however, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the public interest, China has seen a welcome development in the practice and path to sexual and reproductive health education that has been fully developed throughout the life cycle of persons with disabilities.
The Report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical impairments, while having greater difficulty in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships than the general population, have generally developed towards easy and enriched development.
The Workshop on Challenges and Practical Strategies for Comprehensive Sex Education for Persons with Disabilities, organized by the Shanghai Foundation for People with Disabilities and co-sponsored by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International League for the Handicapped (France) in Beijing and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in China, aims at exploring the full cycle of comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and pathways for persons with disabilities in the context of China's health strategy, and at promoting awareness among policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations and parents' representatives of the international policy on comprehensive sexuality education and the right to health of children and young people with disabilities; at a broad exchange of sex education practices, strategies, challenges and resources for children and young people with disabilities in the country, discussing and developing a blueprint for future comprehensive sexuality education for children and young people with disabilities.
Reuters, Beijing, September 30 - On Sunday, the Central Bank of China announced data on the scheduled short-term outflows of foreign currency assets, showing that at the end of August this year, the central bank’s foreign currency was empty for 12 months in relation to forward and futures contracts, and that it still had few positions.
The Central Bank’s previous data show that, as of the end of August last year, the Bank had an empty foreign currency position of $6,044 million in forward and futures contracts, the fourth consecutive month; and an empty position of $4,276 million in SDRs.
Since then, the central bank ' s foreign exchange position has remained zero in the long run.
The central bank released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data show that at the end of February 2016, the central bank ' s foreign currency had more than $2.438 billion in multiple positions on forward and futures contracts and $28.9 billion in empty positions.
For the first time, September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $16,401 million to $45,301 million.
The Central Bank has previously stated that the forward and futures position of foreign currency vis-à-vis domestic currency mainly reflects the forward foreign exchange operations that the Central Bank conducts with commercial banks to meet the foreign currency debt hedging needs of enterprises, and will continue to provide long-term risk avoidance products on the basis of demand, which will have less impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of 20 September this year, K158 trains were taken to the crane wall by Joe, who was studying in Zhengzhou.
A master on the train bought no ticket, but took her seat: "Clap it."
Two hours' drive, the trainmaster advised him that one hour was still not valid.
Eventually, a male passenger in the same car couldn't watch and pulled him up.
From the point of view of truth, although most of the end result is that the hegemonics are condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security services, and even included in a blacklist of honesty, the public still feels that they are not “defended”: why should he not be punished on the spot?
Why can it not be stopped on the spot, or even outlawed, to punish him afterwards?
And how can a male passenger be dragged up by a man who “slids in the road” for his irrational behaviour?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police officers, who generally do not; even when they do, the police are concerned about the possible rogue reaction of the hegemonics and do not take forcible removal measures.
Repeated incidents of hegemonic incidents have made people aware of the need for hegemonics to be forcibly removed and even punished on the spot in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our train be bold enough to take robust measures in a timely manner, and that unattended trains be equipped as soon as possible to ensure the timely cessation and suppression of violations.
On 1 October, on the first day of the national holiday, there was a surge in vehicles in the direction of the Sichuan Kitagawa Autonomous District to Songpan, Mo County.
At around 1300 hours the Northgawa Traffic Police received a telephone call stating that there had been a traffic accident between members of their family in Songpan and that, owing to the limited medical conditions in the area, they were in urgent need of medical attention in Sumiyang.
In the event that one-way traffic controls are in place on the Tang Jiaxai Loch Road in Kitagawa, the traffic police would like to release the 120 ambulance.
Upon receipt of a call for help, the civilian police on duty promptly reported the information to the brigade, and once the Chief of Staff had been briefed, the police officer on duty at the control point was assigned to contact the helper and asked for a full escort.
“There were more than 1,000 vehicles that entered the controlled section at the time, and after contacting the 120 first aid vehicle, it was expected that we would arrive in Kitagawa at around 1500 hours and that we would immediately arrange to deploy. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Lieutenant Commander Zhou Wei of the Kitagawa Police Department introduced the need for a first aid vehicle to cross the Tang Jia Shanxi Lake Loch Road and the narrowness of the road. In order to prevent parallel rows of vehicles that have already entered this route, traffic police enforce a sub-control of vehicles at the beginning, centre and end of the road one hour in advance, and remind all passing drivers to turn aside the side of the road and miscarry the ambulance.
Subsequently, the civilian police of the drum squadron temporarily stopped the vehicle from entering the control section, queuing the incoming 120 first aid vehicles.
At around 1500 hours an ambulance with a Kawakawa licence plate drove into Kitagawa territory, and a police vehicle was sent to escort the ambulance across the control section.
It is understood that only one vehicle will be able to pass through some of the areas on the lake road, and that the civilian police pre-empted these areas and ensured the smooth passage of 120 first aid vehicles.
Upon arrival at the village of Ten Mile, a road could not be mistaken, so the traffic police contacted the village council in advance, borrowed the village road to bypass it and prohibited the entry of social vehicles.
“It took only 40 minutes to get a 120 ambulance from Kitagawa Traffic Police to the normal road into 302 province. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Wei said that, under normal circumstances, the entire passage time would take four hours.
“This arrangement has succeeded in securing valuable treatment time for patients. It's not like we're going anywhere.
At 1720 hours, it was reported that patients in serious danger were sent to Myeongyang in time for treatment.
The number of confirmed deaths resulting from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen rapidly to 832, and the authorities are concerned that this number will rise as relief workers find it difficult to provide assistance to remote areas that have lost contact.
Particularly worrying is the fact that the area north of Baru, with a population of 300,000, is close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Two other areas have lost contact with the outside world since Friday.
“We have not received reports from the other three regions.”
Communications and electricity continued to be disrupted.
Nugroho stated that the missing persons included five foreigners, three of whom were French, one Korean and one Malaysian.
The earthquake and tsunami killed 832 people.
Vice-President Kara of Indonesia stated that the death toll could rise to thousands.
Earlier, Indonesian President Zoko-Vidodo had visited the affected areas and called on the population to endure.
Reuters November 4th - The British Daily Telegraph Sunday reported that British Deutsche Secretary of State Dominic Raab had privately requested Britain to “guarantee” the right to leave the Irish border after three months.
It has been reported that Rabb made this request to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland at a private meeting in London last Tuesday.
It was reported that this requirement was “manifestly in contradiction” with the statement of British Cabinet Minister David Lidington when he visited Dublin three days later.
The Department of De-European Affairs of the United Kingdom indicated that it would not comment on private meetings.
Yesterday morning, at 8.05 a.m., two suspects of theft were arrested while they were stealing at the Yongding gate of the 20th bus to the Junction.
Two poaching men cut the passengers ' jackets, stole $800 of cash from them, and the civilian police, who had been standing by, caught.
This was the first time that Beijing police had solved a robbery.
At around 5 a.m. yesterday morning, the PSAM counter-investigators arrived at their intended position.
According to past experience, areas of concentration, public transport hubs, public transport subway lines, including those viewing the flag raising at Tiananmen Square, are the focus of their work.
In the flow of people, civilian police officers in civilian clothes were calmly observing the past.
At more than 7 a.m., investigators who were on guard at the bus stop found two suspicious men with a male passenger on the 20th bus from the Yongjing Gate.
In the car, two suspicious men, one to the left, caught the male passengers in the middle, one of whom tried to shield the other.
They do not know, however, that every move they make has already fallen into the eyes of civilian police officers in civilian clothes who are watching.
While waiting for a man to steal, the civilian police, in plain clothes, were caught by investigators after they had taken their hands.
Beijing Morning Reporters saw that the civilian police seized $800 in cash from suspected thieves.
“They took the money from the passenger's pocket. It's not like we're going anywhere.
The police pointed to a broken jacket pocket and said, "They cut it open and stole $800 from a tourist who came to Kyoto. When we caught them, the money was just put in their own pocket. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Journalists learned that civilian police officers in civilian clothes had followed them for an hour and had finally been caught while they were committing the crime.
Two suspects are currently under police review.
The civilian plainclothes police told journalists who was suspicious in the crowd, which was a simple question for the civilian police.
“When thieves are caught more, they see that, unlike ordinary passengers, who stare at people's pockets and backpacks, they like to drill in crowds instead of hiding. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Civilian police also told journalists that suspects often wait for cars without purpose, preferring to wander around the station and find someone to steal them.
"It's all about experience. It's been drying up for a long time. It's not like it's a bad idea.
In addition, the civilian police suggested that “the outer garments are the most convenient and the most vulnerable to theft. It's not like it's a bad idea.
When travelling, care is taken of their belongings in case of theft.

British Prime Minister Teresa May called on his party on Sunday to unite in support of her exit plan, directly calling for the support of critics, saying that the free trade agreement they wanted was at the heart of her exit plan.
On 30 September 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May travelled to attend the Conservative Conference in Birmingham, England.
At the start of this exciting annual Conservative Conference, Teresa May’s plan was again criticized by two former cabinet ministers, including former Foreign Minister Johnson, who called her plan “disturbed.”
But she has also received strong support from other pro-European ministers, who “congratulate Teresa May as one of the most polite people” and Foreign Minister Fox and Hunt, who also point their anger at the EU.
Theresa May’s already weak leadership this month was further constrained by the EU’s rejection of part of the so-called “Chicks” plan.
However, Teresa May views these consultations positively, stating that she is prepared to consider the EU's doubts.
"The message I sent to my own party is that let us work together to find the best agreement for Britain," Teresa May said.
Former British Foreign Secretary Johnson called Teresa May’s plan “disordered” and criticized her for her lack of confidence in the retreat.
He and former British Deutsche Secretary Davis are pushing for a Canadian-style FTA with the EU.
For her part, Teresa May stated that the proposal would result in different tariff provisions for Northern Ireland, which would be divided from the United Kingdom.
It's six years from now.
On 30 March, the announcement announced the official launch of a new round of corporate strategic upgrades, with a new round of optimization of the organizational structure six years later, which was reorganized to six, based on the original seven major clusters (BGs) and which did not involve downsizing.
It's a new six.
In six years, two new clusters emerged.
It is understood that the new enterprise groups maintain both the advantages and characteristics of deep tilling vertically, maintaining the original enterprise development business groups (CDGs), interactive entertainment (IEGs), technical engineering (TEGs), and micro-trust (WXGs); and highlighting the convergence effects of the new cloud and intelligent industry (CSIGs), platform and content (PCGs).
Journalists have noticed that the former mobile Internet business (MIG) and the former Internet media business (OMG) have all disappeared, especially OMG, with high external visibility.
The announcement indicates that the newly created platform and content business group (PCG, Platform & Content Group) will organically divide and reorganize the former social networking business group (SNG), the former mobile Internet business group (MIG), and the former web media community (OMG) with highly related and integrated segments such as social platforms, traffic platforms, digital content, and core technologies.
The new cloud and intelligence industry (CSIG, or Cloud and Smart Industries Group) will bring together industry solutions, such as telecommunication cloud, Internet+, smart retail, education, health, safety, and LBS, to boost the digital upgrading of the industry.
The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Board of Information said that the second half of the Internet was industrial Internet, that the first half of the session provided quality services to users by connecting, and that the second half of the session would build on the new and more open connectivity ecology of the enabling industries and consumers.
In response to the rumour of “retrenchment”, there is no explicit reduction.
Following the announcement of the restructuring, it was reported that the restructuring would involve downsizing.
“It is clear that this restructuring will not involve downsizing. We will move the business modules as a whole, grouping them and optimizing them. It's not like it's a bad idea.
Marlon has promoted France's legacy of Long Stick Bread to protect the French technology-net.
On October 1st, China Newsnet reported that European countries had each left behind their own unique diets, and that France had recently planned to apply for long stick bread for inclusion in the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage, following Belgian beer and Naples pancakes in Italy.
The plan is known to have been promoted by French President Marlon, with the support of the French bakery union.
They pointed out that many of the breads now sold were made of large-scale frozen noodles, with flour, water, yeasts and materials other than salt, and that traditional handmade bakeries were gradually being diluted in the hope that their listing would protect the world ' s well-known French skills.
UNESCO will hold its annual meeting in Mauritius in late November to review the list of intangible cultural heritage.
The sinking of an illegal immigrant ship in the Aegean Sea in Turkey resulted in the death of five people.
On 30 September, Xinhua News Agency, Istanbul, reported by the Turkish media on 30 September that an inflatable ship carrying illegal immigrants had fallen over the waters of the Turkish Aegean Sea on that day, killing at least five people.
It was reported that the inflatable ship that was scheduled to travel to an island in Greece sank that day near the Enez area of the Edirne province in north-western Turkey for unknown reasons.
At present, it is not clear how many illegal immigrants were on board the inflatable ship.
The search-and-rescue operations are continuing, as it is estimated that people in water are still trapped at sea.
The Aegean Sea had been the preferred route for illegal immigrants smuggled through Turkey to the European continent.
The number of people smuggled through this route has been significantly reduced since Turkey regulated it under an agreement signed with the EU in March 2016.
Since this year, however, there has been a rebound in the number of smuggled people on this route.
According to the Nobel Prize Commissioner Network, at 11.30 a.m. local time in Stockholm, Sweden, the American immunologist James Alison and the Japanese immunologist were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine 2018 for discovering cancer therapy that inhibited anti-immunological regulation.
According to Japanese media reports, Ben Yui was the 26th Nobel Prize-winning Japanese, as well as the 5th prize-winning Japanese in physiology or medicine. At 76 years of age, Ben Yu made a significant contribution to the treatment of cancer, and he learned about his award in his laboratory.
According to the information received, Ben Yu, born on 27 January 1942, is a Japanese doctor, a medical practitioner, a foreign student of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States, a member of the Japanese Bachelor ' s School and currently a visiting professor at Kyoto University.
In the light of the discovery of T-cell inhibitor receptor PD-1 in 1992, cancer immunisation therapy was launched in 2013 and was the top 10 scientific breakthroughs in Science.
On September 21, 2016, Ben was named as one of the closest Japanese to the Nobel Prize.
Chinese tourists were beaten at Thai airport: the hit man was fired and the airport president was dismissed.
On September 30, Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino-Sino has reported that video footage of Chinese citizens being beaten at the airport in Bangkok in Shimangman Airport recently has attracted widespread attention.
At 2 p.m. local time, the Managing Director of the Thai airport company Shimman Airport, Surinwa, made a statement about the security of the airport, and expressed his deep apologies.
On the other hand, according to the information received, the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand attached great importance to the matter, had ordered the dismissal of the airport staff responsible for the incident, and had ordered the general abolition of the work at the airport.
The head of the Airport Administration stated that at that time, the Chinese tourist had been in conflict with the security forces because he was dissatisfied with the refusal to enter the country and was unwilling to comply with the management and stay in the restricted areas of repatriation.
Currently, the Airport Authority has suspended the security guard.
The incident has already had an impact on the image of Thai tourism, and the Tanghamán airport, for its part, is deeply sorry about it and, in order to make up for the damage, will next convey its deep apologies to the Chinese visitor who was attacked through the Chinese Embassy.
Finally, the Managing Director of the airport, Sulinwa, stated that he continued to welcome Chinese tourists to Thailand and that more assistance and facilities had been provided for Chinese visitors to Thailand, including opening special courtesy routes for Chinese passports at the time of entry, including 18 at Suwanaip Airport, 21 at Chanman Airport and 18 at Phuket Airport; 8 at Chiang Mai Airport; and 10 at Hoai Airport.
Thailand's headline news network was informed by Major General Suratcher, the new head of Thailand's National Immigration Service and former deputy head of Thailand's Tourism Police, that Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister had given high priority to the matter, had ordered the dismissal of the airport staff responsible for the incident, and had abolished the general inspection of Mann Airport.
In recent years, there have been many instances of school plastic runway irregularities.
To that end, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular requiring the implementation of the new national logo for surface sports sites for synthetic materials for primary and secondary schools to be delivered after 1 November this year.
The mandatory national standard, " Grounds for the fielding of synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools " , which was led by the Ministry of Education and was drafted with the participation of 26 research institutes and testing agencies, was revised over two years by organizing more than 100 expert meetings during which it was validated, as well as country-wide field visits, sample tests and the collection of numerous validation experiments involving hundreds of enterprises in the market.
Journalists have found that the new national marker has not only changed from a “national recommended standard” to a “national mandatory standard” but has also added a number of elements, including thickness requirements, physical performance, age-resilient performance, inorganic filling requirements, high-polymer content requirements for slide-resistant particles, limits on hazardous material for surface-forming products, and limits on hazardous substances for non-solid and solid materials.
In particular, it is worth mentioning that the new national sign limits the amount of hazardous substances that may be produced in the construction of the school plastic runway from the original 7 to 18 items, and regulates the amount of volatile organic matter in the built runway in accordance with the domestic standards.
If the release of hazardous substances is specified in the “Limitation and odour requirements for hazardous substances in ready-made and pre-fabricated surface products”, total volatile organic compounds should not exceed 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde should not exceed 0.4 mg/m3, carbon dioxide should not exceed 7 mg/m3, benzene should not exceed 0.1 mg/m3, and odour levels should not exceed 3 levels.
The new national logo also provides details on sampling requirements for plastic runways at primary and secondary schools, testing rules, sentencing rules, etc.
In addition, for the first time, campus artificial lawns were included in mandatory testing of national standards.
In the near future, special work will be carried out on the implementation of the new national logo, which will be submitted to the Department of Physical Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education during the year.
On the afternoon of September 30th, the Chinese Internet client Chengdu played "National Ping Civil War" at the Women’s World Cup finals in 2018.
In the end, Zhu Yunling, a teammate who fought the main battle at 4.0 a.m. of Tinning, took the throne of the Women ' s Ping World Cup in four years ' time, the twenty-first time that the Chinese girl had taken the crown.
Dining and Zhu Rainling are teammates and friends, both of whom are quite familiar with each other's tactics.
Whether they are prepared or warmed up, both sides follow each other.
Entered the finals, and the two said, by mutual agreement, that they had completed their tasks.
But the match between Tining and Chu Rain Ling in the game is a sword-sword.
In the first round, the winner of the three-to-one round, with experience in the field, will then be three-square-square with Tinning.
Then Zhu Rain Ling's mistakes in the attack began to increase, and Dinning seized the opportunity and took the lead at 3:5 and took the lead at 10:6.
Despite the fact that Joo Rain Ling is chasing 3 points in a row, Dinning still takes the first round at 11:9.
In the second round, Zhu Raining's mistakes remain high, with Dining leading by 6:1 with his comparative advantage.
Zhu Rainling scored two points in a row with rhythm changes when it was 2:7 behind, and then used the attack to track it to 8:9.
At a critical moment, Tinning won two minutes at 11:8.
In the third round, the two started with a sharp strike of 3.3.
Dinning subsequently lost three points in a series of errors during the attack, although she then took advantage of the sharp attack to score three points to six.
Zhu Rain Ling scored two points to re-establish the advantage and took the lead in getting the point at 10:8.
But Dinning's attack was brutal, with a four-point run and a third round at 12.10.
In the fourth round, Zhu Rain Ling leads by 4:2.
But since then, Dinning has shown an extremely aggressive state of play and has scored four points before stopping Zhu Rain Ling.
After the pause, Zhu Rain Ling recovered some of his state and gradually pursued the score to 8:8.
At this critical juncture, Dinning did not have a soft hand and scored two points to the point.
As Joo Rainling returned to the ball, Dining won at 4:0.
Last month, Dinning won his 14-month-old championship in the Bulgarian public competition, which ended in Chengdu, despite the fact that she had stated before the race that she had not set a target for the fight, and in the semi-finals that ended in the morning, Dinning said that she had completed her mission.
In the end, Dinning won the third personal World Cup champion, Jo Raining, who was satisfied with her performance: "One champion is important to every athlete.
I didn't think of that before the game, but I said one game to go, and the finals to play very well. It's not like it's a bad idea.
When Joo-Lin, the main battler, harvested a silver medal, failed to achieve the goal of defending the crown, and when she spoke about whether the enthusiastic viewers in the home were putting invisible pressure on themselves, she said, “I think I can handle the whole game in terms of pressure, and today’s Dinning is doing a great job, so I never found the rhythm. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The activation of rural consumption depends on a normalization mechanism to clean up the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption and increase the farmers ' sense of access to consumption.
The data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, with retail sales of rural consumer goods growing 10.5 per cent in the first half of the year, at a rate of 1.3 percentage points higher than in towns.
In a poor village in a western district, there was only one convenience store in the village, and some of the goods seemed to have known each other. The “gold dragonfish” had been marked as “gold dragon oil”, the “bong” had become a “high milk” and the “bunk” commodities were abundant.
Over the years, similar phenomena have become frequent, and it is insufferable that some of the country ' s poor goods are branded with similar names, similar packaging, and false.
A consumption survey published in one municipality in the west revealed that the problem of super-false goods in rural businesses was serious, with 66 per cent of users buying counterfeit goods at supermarkets under the township line, of which more than half were food products.
Why does the Li Gyu continue to fight so often?
Unlike the urban market, farmers are less aware of their rights and, together with the remoteness of many rural areas, are left in a blind zone with insufficient regulatory power, giving fertile ground to counterfeit goods.
A commodity with multiple headwinds, some sectors manage prices, some manage production, some manage markets, some manage cross-cutting functions, annual vacations, a concentration of the wind, fake goods escape the wind and come out slowly, just after old ones and new ones appear.
The lack of long-term regulatory mechanisms, the impurity of rural markets, the low cost of violating laws and the high level of benefits have led to the emergence of “downhills” and “downhills” by some illegal traders.
From food to health, farmers in general are moving towards developmental consumption.
Recently, the Party's Central and State Council issued a number of Opinions on Improving the Institutional Mechanism for Consumer Promotion to further boost the consumption potential of the population, in which they proposed to promote the upgrading of the consumption ladder for rural residents, with the aim of enabling large numbers of farmers to “consumption” “consumption willing” and “consumption willing” to “consumption” and making rural consumption truly flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen the reforms to eliminate the many political and regulatory shortcomings of the market, to improve the food safety and quality monitoring network and to reduce the amount of space available to rural people to make and sell them.
On the other hand, greater enforcement of the law and the regulation of “breath vessels” must not be allowed to spread in rural areas.
Strict punishment of pit farmers, however hidden they may be, should not be used as a justification for the growth of bad commodities, and the authorities concerned should clarify their responsibilities and the downside of the regulatory power at the grass-roots level.
Market access is strictly closed, strict qualifications are applied to producers, market circulation is closed, products are routed and cleared, and sources and roots are used to reassure legitimate distributors and farmers.
:: Activate rural consumption in order to direct demand for healthy consumption.
As consumption escalates, many farmers not only seek to eat well and well, but also to live high-quality lives such as culture, health and so forth, and cannot put rural markets in the same way as “low-quality” “cheap” paintings.
This requires the promotion of e-commerce to extend rural coverage to a wide range of rural areas, the opening of urban and rural two-way distribution channels, the promotion of a combination of off-line industrial development platforms and online power-trading platforms, and support for the expansion of new patterns of consumption to rural markets; the promotion of the organic integration of commercial logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc. in the conditionalities of the municipalities; and the development of modern rural networks of circulation, optimizing the integration of storage facilities resources and effectively reducing rural mobility costs.
Create a clear and reassuring market environment for rural areas, so that farmers can consume less and so that rural consumption can flourish and increase their sense of access and well-being.
With effect from 1 November, we reduced some of our most-favoured-nation (MFN) tariff rates to 7.5 per cent.
In accordance with the decision of the State Council at its 26th General Meeting, the State Council Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs issued a bulletin on 30 November 2018 to reduce the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate for some commodities.
According to the Declaration of the State Council ' s Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs on the Reduction of Tariffs on Imports of Selected Goods, the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate for certain goods, such as industrial goods, has been reduced as of 1 November this year, in order to meet the demands of industrial upgrading, lower business costs and multi-level public consumption.
There are 1585 tariff lines, which account for about 19% of our total, and the average tax rate has dropped from 10.5% to 7.8%, an average of 26%.
This reduction relates mainly to textiles; stone, ceramic, glass products; parts of iron and steel and base metals; electromechanical equipment and parts such as metalworking machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transmission equipment, electrical appliances, instrumentation instruments, etc.; and resource-based goods and primary processed products such as non-metallic mines, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, and precious stones.
At the same time, the tariff rates for imports of imported goods have been adjusted downwards with the overall level of tariffs, particularly on medicines and consumer daily goods.
In order to follow up on the deployment of the Party's central and State Council decisions, we imposed zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines on 1 May of this year, reduced tariffs on imports of cars and parts, some daily consumer goods, and implemented a third-step reduction in the information technology agreement for the extension of products.
Journalists have learned from the State Council’s Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs that, since this year, following successive autonomous adjustments, our overall tariff level has fallen from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%, an average reduction of 23%.
Appropriate tariff reductions can contribute to balanced external trade and higher levels of external openness, as well as to the integrated use of both domestic and international resources to advance domestic supply-side structural reforms.
This year, according to the relevant head of the Commission, marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening-up process, and the positive reduction of the overall level of tariffs is a practical step towards implementing the spirit of the important statement made by the Secretary-General Xi at the Boguang Asian Forum, as well as an important step towards the further expansion of openness and the proactive expansion of imports in the light of our own high-quality development needs. This initiative and initiative demonstrate China ' s firm commitment to a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, which, while enhancing its own development drive, will also better benefit China ' s development.
On 29 September, the regional public branding of the agricultural products of the “neighborhoods” of Gansu County was held in the southern Kasai district of Tianjin city.
Red Army milled rice, black beans, mountain children singing Montenegrin goats, well-dressed tea, paper-cut film books, bare-hand slippers... A piece of well-packaged agricultural produce is placed on the stand, and they have a common brand name called “Travellers.”
“The creation of a regional brand of `neighborhoods' has effectively addressed the development bottlenecks of `many, small and weak' agricultural products in surrounding counties, and has become a powerful vehicle for poverty alleviation. “29, the regional public branding of the produce of the `Gansu Ring', organized by Gansu Riong County, was held in the southern Kasa region of Tianjin City.
The city is at the border of the three provinces of Hanqing, as the “national food production advanced county” and the “punishment of China's small grains” and the “punishment of China”, with its long history and resources.
The taste of lamb, yellow wine, pasta, soft paste, etc., is even more common when it comes to travelling in other parts of the country.
With the increasing level of urbanization in China and the rapid increase in the urban population, large numbers of young people in rural areas have left their homes to start urban life.
China’s agricultural brand research expert, Yang Xiao Jia, said: “Now that urban life is fast and under stress, more and more people are beginning to miss rural life as a child, but, ‘When you don’t go back home, the most beautiful memory is the village’ – the design of the brand of ‘natives’ is named after the country and the country of the people who are wandering around.’ It's not like it's a bad idea.
The weather conditions in the surrounding counties are exceptional, with long daylight periods, high temperatures and poor weather conditions, and uniquely favourable conditions for the cultivation of small and special groceries.
The country is home to more than 20 small groceries, which are home to the country ' s small groceries and produce the highest output in the country.
As a volunteer, Wang Xiao Li was attending the round table at Tianjin School, where she said, “The natives are the closest, the natives are the best, and the ‘Roadsmen’ brand brings home too many memories of us, and even more of the food that we remember, and hopes that the ‘Roadsmen’ brand is getting farther and bigger.” It's not like it's a bad idea.
Dr. Tam Bin, a researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve Agency, said that the detection data for agricultural products such as barley, bitterness, and black beans in the county had a strong advantage through the testing of more than 900 sets of indicators, that many of the groceries had higher levels of biologically active substances than standard data, and that the “neighbors” had an inherent advantage in the country's high-end groceries market.
Tsai Chun, Secretary-General of Tsai Chun, said that through the branding of `clans', it would further enhance the quality, standardization, scale-up and innovation levels of quality agricultural products in Csong County. It would help to shape a good overall image of agricultural products in Csong County and quickly increase their visibility, competitiveness and value added.
In July, Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 0.2% over the previous month, an increase that exceeded expectations, raising the market’s expected interest rate rise next month.
If it does, it will be the Bank’s fifth raise in a little more than a year.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters had previously estimated an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Statistics Canada reported growth on Friday in 12 of the 20 industries.
This figure is noteworthy because this year’s central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors could delay the third quarter of GDP.
The Governor of the Central Bank of Canada, Polotz, promised on Thursday that the Central Bank would continue to raise interest rates gradually and would pay close attention to economic data.
The next time the Central Bank of Canada announces interest rates will be on October 24th.
The Central Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian economy and the near-lowest unemployment rate recorded.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at the Kaiser macro level, said that the country ' s economy was expected to grow by about 2 per cent per annum in the third quarter of the year.
“This is going to be 1.5% higher than the Central Bank of Canada expected, and will therefore be another reason to expect the Central Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month,” he says in a report.
The overnight index swap shows that the market’s estimate of the Central Bank of Canada’s October interest rate rises from 76.46% to 78.27%.
Korea's first joint inspection of Han River into the sea in '65
On the same day, the Korean Ministry of Defence confirmed that the two Koreas had launched a joint expedition into the waters of the open sea of the Han and Jin Rivers.
The initiative is an advance preparation to guarantee the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
The press briefing provided by the Korean Ministry of Defence on the same day indicated that this was the first joint inspection of the Han River entrance since the signing of the Korean War Armistice Agreement in 1953.
In September this year, the two Koreas signed a military agreement to conduct a joint inspection of the waters of the Han River, such as the mouth of the sea, in order to guarantee environmental protection, tourism and so on.
In October, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea planned a joint expedition to the waters at a general-level meeting.
On 5 November, a joint Korean-Korean water expedition was officially launched.
The joint mission consisted of 20 members, including the Korean and Korean military, experts and others.
According to the Korean Ministry of Defence, neither party was armed during the mission and it was prohibited to use the words and actions of the other.
“Because there was no military demarcation line near the entrance to the sea, the area had been an unexpectedly high area, but through joint missions, it would become a new peace zone in the future. It's not like it's a bad idea.
The total length of the waters of this joint Korean-Korean expedition is approximately 70 kilometres, with a total area of approximately 280 square kilometres.
The Ministry of Defence of Korea stated that the Korean side would send six cruise ships to explore, inter alia, the depth of the seawater to provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters and that, after the completion of the survey, navigational maps would be provided for the movement of civilian vessels.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea had held summit talks in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on the joint use of the Han River and the Jinji River at sea, but the follow-up negotiations were stalled by tensions on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the two Koreas in September, future ships from both sides would need to inform each other in advance before sailing in common waters.
On November 5th, the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia reported that Chinese citizens Guo Yuxiang and Mao Yunxin had recently lost contact during their tour.
It is understood that two members of the Blue Sky rescue team were in contact with their relatives and friends in the country on 19 October and said that they were on their way to explore the mountains near Lake Kusugur and shared their positions through Twitter, after which they lost contact and were suspected to have gone to no-man ' s area.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and to consular protection and assistance.
Upon learning of the loss of contact between the two tourists, the Embassy immediately launched an emergency response plan to secure bail, seeking to seize the gold rescue time and to do its utmost.
The Embassy maintains close communication with the families of the individuals concerned, assists them to report the incident immediately to the police and provides them with a list of translators for their choice.
The Embassy met with the heads of the Ministry of External Relations of Mongolia, the General Police Department and the General Directorate for Emergency Situations to inform them of the situation, and requested that the search and rescue be conducted as soon as possible and that close communication be maintained with the Mongolian side throughout the search and rescue process to ensure that the latest developments are kept up to date.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the families in issuing information on tracing in Monhua and the Chinese enterprise in a widespread campaign to actively engage in tracing, provide effective leads and provide assistance to several Blue Sky rescue workers who went to Mon for relief.
With the strong impetus of the Embassy, the party first dispatched a rescue team and promised to waive search and rescue costs.
The police and emergency departments of the department of Qusugur were instructed to do their utmost to search and rescue.
Owing to the remoteness of Lake Kusugur at the border with Russia in the north of Mongolia, its vastness, and extremely difficult access to transport and communications, as well as the fact that Mongolia has now entered a harsh winter with a low temperature of about 20 degrees below zero, the local police and emergency services have overcome enormous difficulties by mobilizing almost all of their police forces and mobilizing local pastoralists to carry out a wide range of carpet search and rescue operations around lost positions, including by riding, walking and visiting pastoralists.
At the same time, in view of the particular situation in the pastoral areas, Monfang has been broadcasting bulletins for many days.
The staff of the country's Blue Sky rescue team have also come to participate actively with Mong.
The safety and security of the two missing persons has always touched our hearts.
It has been more than 10 days since the two men lost contact, and the Embassy has received some leads, but they have still not been found, and search and rescue operations are still under way.
The Embassy will continue to follow up the matter on the basis of the principle of “people-centred” and will promote the continuation of full search and rescue efforts and the provision of maximum assistance to the families of the persons concerned.
The Embassy calls for contacts to be made with the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia at the first time, if any, in Monk and in the business.
