At the academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, students sang the leading role, and the research results made people brain-open
Wash your hands with air, judge diseases with a sigh, and accurately search for the source of smog Last evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research covers the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities and education, etc., and the students have created many high-end inventions with application value from a curious idea, some of which have won domestic and international awards.
Biosensors: Your home medical examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on the smartphone side, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to exhale lightly, and the device can detect your physical health from the composition of the air you exhale. ”
Zhang Diming said that the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling the air, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material, whose target is chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Light: The Doctor's High-Energy Eye
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver medal at this year's 44th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
"The early detection and resection of many diseases are not in place, which is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room. ”
For example, during the early detection of cancer, if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, the cancer cells will spread later, Shen Junfei said.
This smart surgical lamp has four light discs that adjust the spectrum to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and no-shadow rate of the light spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has been tried in the Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, the Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: Cool and water-efficient
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, and Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air handwashing device".
As soon as we stand on the device's handwashing station, our body weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and binds to the water.
That way, we'll be able to wash our hands!"
Chromogenic reaction and bacterial residue experiments have shown that the effect of handwashing by this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, the invention was awarded the only gold medal among the world's top universities.

I think it is a very meaningful certificate - first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think is important in addition to my driver's license!
Popularize: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance comes.
As we all know, there is actually some time before the ambulance comes after the accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I do have a heart attack, a cerebral hemorrhage, respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
That's why it's important for people around you to understand first aid!
When someone around us falls, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, instead of standing there stupidly and doing nothing, this feeling of helplessness is too terrifying.
"In China, according to our official data, three million people die unexpectedly every year, and the most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average is 15% of people who can be saved.
In Las Vegas, 780 percent of them can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, less than 1 percent. ”
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Response, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, the breath is gone, the heartbeat is gone, and you can't pinch the person for any purpose.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save the person.
I found that few of us have the awareness to learn first aid, but when it happens, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it could save a life!
The first aid certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross training center, I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there is a discount for students.
PS: The last picture is to record the goal to be completed before the age of 25, and it was a few months ago to add the first aid certificate to the goal list, but it was indeed completed!
Then I'm going to take other certificates I want to take, and I'm going to take a diving certificate, I saw a diving first-aid certificate in Xiaohongshu before, and it seems that you have to have a first-aid certificate to take this certificate, so in fact, the first-aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#

Because obviously when I typed the code before, it was valid
Let's talk about the conclusion first, I personally think that "Four Seas" is an all-round bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But if you want to say that this movie is not a highlight, it is not that at least the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that allows you to fall asleep soundly in the cinema, and one that makes you indignant after watching it, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a gram novel, indescribable, and with many loopholes, it is like a trench coat on Brother Pony's body.
Even after watching it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you will find that it is actually a piece of.
Let's start with a few episodes that are hard for me to understand.
The male protagonist's place of residence should be on a small island in the south.,And his grandmother depends on him.。
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a small van.
The elderly man sat in a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow??
He and his dad were very relieved about this.
Then the old man was gone.
opened a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the heroine and his brother get a business license?
Why can the biker gangsters on the island easily close a section of mountain road? ?
Then the truck delivering the steel bars in the middle of the road was parked on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
The sense of this prop is too obvious.
Why would a gangster who is not trustworthy and suspected of violating the law become an auxiliary policeman?
Why didn't you call the police in the face of loan sharks, and the police in the movie specifically asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to sit outside the door of the hotel and sleep overnight?
This kind of inexplicable plot pervades the whole film, and the plot is so outrageous that it pains me when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is even worse is the theme of the movie, or the movie has no theme at all, it is an abominable stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy, after more than 20 minutes, you guess that it may be an inspirational film, and when you watch it halfway, you think it may be a drama film that wants to reflect the difficulty of survival of young people in small towns.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies, for example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie is to succeed step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, then you can honestly talk about the grievances between the young man in the small town who likes to ride a motorcycle and the waiter girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't have anything that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's role in the new motorcycle that was just burned down and can still sing), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand watching.
As for the heroine, she is obviously not mentally retarded, but she behaves like a 5-year-old child in some aspects, I really don't know if this is the reason for her acting skills or the director's requirements.
Another thing I don't understand, why is Han Han, as a race car driver, so keen to add crash scenes to his own movies?
Is such a movie arranged in the Spring Festival file to add to the audience's blockage?

Chongqing Secondary Vocational School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Enrollment is an enterprise prospective employee-Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and admission procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprises be standardized, and the dual identities of apprentices and prospective employees of secondary vocational schools are clarified, and in accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement, for apprentices who have reached the age of 16 and have not reached the age of 18, they must be signed by the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and rights and interests of the apprentices on the job.
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for employees of cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training program, and the internship is generally 6 months.
According to the characteristics of different majors, 1 master can take 2~5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city identified 60 municipal-level secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, with each pilot number of about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) were trained.
In accordance with the principle of pilot first and then implementation, and gradually advancing from point to area, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education, effectively improve students' job skills, and improve the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctor: Although Omicron is highly transmissible, most of them are mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus causes milder illnesses than the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
As the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physician group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa, reported that the COVID patients they are treating are experiencing mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughs similar to flu, according to the Associated Press.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none have yet required hospitalization.
"They were able to control their illness at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said. ”
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems who would otherwise be more vulnerable to severe illness from coronavirus infection.
In comparison, he said, in the last wave of the Delta pandemic, the Covid patients he treated "had trouble breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people are hospitalized within a few days."
In the two weeks following the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take a few more weeks to gather enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to South Africa's National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30 per cent of COVID patients hospitalised in recent weeks are severely ill, half of the severe illness in the previous wave, the average length of stay has shortened from eight days to 2.8 days, and only 3 per cent of recent COVID patients have died, compared to 20 per cent of cases in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute for Health, said: "At the moment, almost all indications point to a milder disease . ”
He added: "It's still early days, and we need to get the later data.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only been in this wave for two weeks. ”
At the same time, scientists around the world are looking at the number of cases and hospitalizations while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant strain of the coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, Gauteng saw a 400 per cent increase in new cases in the first week of December, with tests showing the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 per cent of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been given away!

Education Times: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we draw an analogy to the famous public service advertising slogan "No Sale, No Killing", then in a good environment where there is no demand for "abduction", mass prevention and mass management, and the whole people fight against trafficking, making trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, and this kind of crime will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Anti-Abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency release platform for information on missing children.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the dissemination of information on missing children and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
When I heard that this App was called "Reunion", I felt full of warmth.
The new technology means are not only "literary and artistic" and full of feelings, but also the proper use of information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many "big words".
However, until a trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the victim's personal safety.
In terms of priorities, under the urgent purpose of "seeking rescue," topics such as "whether the abduction and trafficking of children should be uniformly subject to the death penalty" and other controversial topics can be put aside for discussion and discussed cautiously, but the matter of rescuing abducted children must not be treated.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to moving away from the place of crime as soon as possible after they have succeeded.
If the abduction operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parent, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the "reunion" platform that directly helps to solve the case and recover the child.
After all, "cracking down on abduction" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do a good job.
Cracking down on crime and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulousness of law enforcement, all need to implement the care of "protecting children and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better, from the family to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three was resting at the train station, and the parents were asleep, only to wake up to find that the child was gone.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, there should be at least a considerable sense of protection.
Alternating between parents or placing the child under secure protection is the minimum means of preventing child abduction.
On the other hand, the police are cracking down on trafficking crimes, and the buyer of abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of abduction and trafficking of children is five years;
With a high starting point and a heaviest maximum sentence, the crime of child abduction and trafficking is clearly a crime with heavier penalties under the general trend of "lighter punishment".
However, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and have a weak sense of law.
Legal education for these people should be followed up at the same time.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, it is not possible to rely solely on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" for abduction is widespread, traffickers are motivated by profit, constantly innovate trafficking methods, and form a situation of "fighting" with law enforcers, and the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into a quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, getting rid of backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help eradicate the crime of abducting, selling and buying children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, virgin olive oil and refined olive oil (Lampante olive oil or refined olive oil), with five grades.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is an oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruits, which is mechanically cold-pressed and filtered to remove foreign substances.
Depending on the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, which is an all-natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a pleasant botanical fragrance and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin: slightly higher acidity, but no more than 2%, pure and aromatic taste.
Ordinary Virgin: Acceptable in taste and flavor, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining a virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3 percent, or becoming a "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be classified into two grades:
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is blended with a percentage of virgin olive oil to harmonize flavor and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5 percent and a transparent pale golden yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil is an olive oil that is extracted from pomace by dissolution and refined.
If you've read the grades, you've probably noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olives are like grapes that make wine, olives from different production regions and different varieties of olive fruit will produce different standards of olive oil.
Best places to grow olive:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions such as temperature, sunshine, humidity and precipitation for olive growth.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, only sporadic cultivation can be found in suitable areas.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., as well as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., have similar climates in southern latitudes.
Harvest months for olive:
From March to June, the olive trees bloom and set fruit, and from July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple and finally black.
The harvest season is from November to February (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
Nutrients of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil for the human body among the oils discovered so far.
At the end of the Summit for Democracy, Biden said that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
The virtual Summit for Democracy, convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by government leaders from 110 countries around the world, as well as civil society and the private sector, concluded Friday (10 December).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that the second global "Summit for Democracy" is planned to be held next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwan government and political councilor, and Nathan Law, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit the following day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work lies ahead of us.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I've said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the faint flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. ”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the cushions and shocks of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good," he said. ”
The themes of the second day of the Summit for Democracy were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said in his opening remarks that democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
"Now is the time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, tackling inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a resolute condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. ”
Speaking to the summit via pre-recorded video, Nathan Law, a Hong Kong-based democracy and human rights activist, reminded attendees of continued attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs and Tibetans.
"For too long, the world has accepted China's rise without putting in place a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. ”
Nathan Law also called on the free world to unite against the threat posed by the CCP.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of annoying General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat [of the CCP] to our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. ”
Tang Feng, a political councilor of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, issued a "National Statement" via video during a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming the Value of Democracy", emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the pandemic through transparency and trust-building.
"At a time when Taiwan's democracy is on the rise, we have always been at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and we have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere have justified human rights abuses in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy has shown signs of regression.
In Taiwan, however, we don't have to lock down to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take it off the shelves to defeat disinformation. ”
At the same time as the second day of the Summit for Democracy, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, that have been found to have committed serious human rights violations, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to facilitate human rights abuses.

Hello, the saliva chicken delivered from the restaurant is raw
I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to stick to it, so I wanted to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can't tell, then the normal situation of the expensive will be more friendly than the cheap beat, this kind of "entry shot" is actually industrial waste.
Their intensity is very low, the ball hits the top of the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot withstand it, and it is difficult for the master to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult ———, I know that you can't learn it, and I also know that you are reluctant to buy expensive ones, so you can fool you with a bargain, you play twice, and you won't play again, so that this racket is cheap, and you don't feel distressed."
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have improved, and then come to me to buy expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price to buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince, or Dunlop's, these two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can not be sold at a price, the new auction is 500, 600 is very good, the second-hand 200 yuan, with a thousand yuan racket enjoyment is not fragrant?
It's friendly to novices, but once it passes the novice stage, it's chicken, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the novice stage.
The order has been delayed several times
Can you help me follow up?

Thank you
That is, I already have a credit?

In fact, there is a lot of attention to the dressing and matching of girls who are slightly fat.
Girls with fat bodies should wear skirts that are not too short or too long, and the length is about the knee, just enough to cover the fat thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the legs will be revealed.
If it's too long, it will give people a short and chubby feeling.
If you wear the upper, middle and lower sections, it will seem that you will naturally increase your height, that is, the upper body, skirt and stockings with different colors, it will look like a slender feeling.
In fact, many dark colors are the standard for chubby girls (this is well experienced by the author), dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat, and noble and elegant black short skirts are also the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a short black skirt, will make people think that you are a little thinner.
If your calves are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too much attention.
The more popular, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
So that people don't get the feeling of obesity when people pay attention to your legs and feet.
For slightly chubby girls, we must talk about the trick of dressing and matching.
Chubby girls should never wear tight short skirts, and the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which will make people look very uncomfortable, if the legs are thick, wear black stockings or mesh socks (the kind of fine checkered), choose a soft printed flared skirt, with a swing collar top, which can well cover up the lack of fat girls.
Of course, chubby girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
Fat girls wear short skirts, you should choose a top that matches the color of the short skirt, which will make your chubby figure have the effect of increasing height.
A short skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN match in summer!
If you are a MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous dress.
Not only can it cover the big belly, but it can also show your strengths.
A-line skirts will be very thin, more suitable for fat girls, and tops should be tighter, forming a sense of layering will be thinner.
A simple white T-shirt with a short skirt can also be tried by fat MM.
Chubby girls are also able to wear a sense of fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching, then the chubby girls will also be the focus of attention.
After making changes in dressing and matching, you should also exercise more in your life, and strive to get rid of the label 😄 of a chubby girl one day earlier

The girl was an arrow target to raise money for her sister: "It's okay to think that it's a flesh wound" - Xinhuanet
A girl in Wulin Square in Hangzhou stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human meat target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'target' to raise donations for her sister" swept the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person in Hangzhou's Wulin Square, on which is written the words "human meat target, ten yuan an arrow", indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows to shoot after payment.
The behavior sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of propaganda of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an excesses by raising donations for her sister, but this kind of behavior was not worth advocating.
The girl was admonished for collecting donations on the street
In the online picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board in the shape of "individual", on which the words "human meat target, ten yuan and one arrow" are written in black ink, and another wooden board in front of her is written with her bank account number, WeChat, Alipay account, etc.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this move is "eye-catching begging", and many netizens sympathize with it.
"We found out when we patrolled to the square at around 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already a lot of onlookers. ”
In an interview with local media, the police of the Tianshui Police Station near the incident said that there were two girls in the stall, both about 20 years old, dressed young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who made the "human target" kept crying and begging passers-by to play the game, and another girl helped to shout on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery money, so please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting money for her sister's leukemia treatment. ”
Last night, the person in charge of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told a reporter from the Beijing News that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was raising money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, due to the fact that the treatment still requires more than 30 yuan of expenses, I can't think of a good way to raise donations for a while, so I made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was a target, and the other was responsible for laying down, but they did not participate in it, and no one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but someone watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police were identified by the security department that the bows and arrows used were not under control.
The person in charge said that "this kind of eye-catching fundraising method is not advocated".
After being warned by the police officers, she has left the police station.

What's the hottest in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympians can win medals?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The Olympic Project Manager Can Impact the Gold Medal" article is very popular, which mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match: Moving bricks, traveling, and staying up late are the daily life of project managers, and firefighting, taking the blame, and apologizing are not a problem.
It seems to be a joke and ridicule of an article, but it also expresses the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the inability of the current project management work.
And those who are engaged in project management work are gradually choosing to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament at work.
Judging from the number of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professional Qualification) applicants who are increasing every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "Twenty Years Development Report on Project Management in China (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP applicants in the country is nearly 600,000, the number of PMP certification is about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP®®® holders in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" of the past, and the rapidly changing working environment allows us to know that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can taking the PMP exam ensure that the project management work is unimpeded?
Many beginners in project management say that they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and the five major process groups and other related knowledge points by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: The project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, there is no project management theory, and I don't know how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process and system support, the work cannot be implemented, the project estimation is inaccurate, the control sensitivity is poor, and the project is delayed again and again; The division of labor among members is not clear, and the "old fritters" in the team do not know how to deal with it Cross-departmental assistance and communication are not smooth, and the project is difficult to move forward ......
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and won the honorary title of "R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base for Chinese Enterprises", came with the online course of "R&D Project Manager Training Camp".
"R&D Project Manager Training Camp" Online Course This is an online fragmented learning method, combining the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operational results to enterprises.
If there is no evidence, you can first see what other students have to say about this course: This course is not only explained by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei's R&D management team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises, to explain the course content in simple terms.

Home Credit advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double 12" - Economic Observer.com - Professional financial news website
This year's "Double 11" carnival reached 1.77 trillion yuan in online payment business transactions across the country, a new high compared with previous years.
On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people sigh that the national consumption power is getting stronger and stronger, and on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double 12", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, the performance of Chinese residents at the level of financial consumption is better, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The "Report on the Debt Status of Chinese Youth" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, although the young generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the "excessive profligacy" label labeled by the outside world, but some young people do have excessive consumption, follow the trend of consumption behavior, and thus produce excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even lead to the gradual increase of social problems, financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibility, positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to regulatory calls to enhance consumers' rational consumption awareness with practical actions, especially young people.
Over the past few years, Home Credit has continued to carry out all-round and diversified financial literacy popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions, help them establish rational consumption concepts, reasonably plan consumption needs, and then help them accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of Double 12, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid misunderstandings of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When spending, you must plan ahead and repay the loan on time according to your means.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the economic life of buying a car or house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to bring consumers more suitable and diversified services, continue to help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become a lifelong reliable consumer financial partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Daily - The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) tackles common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the midst of the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar by both countries.
The Gulf Arab states resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar out of the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, with the aim of addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometre-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate mobility for citizens of both countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from both countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with Iran's negotiations with the world's major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab states for not finding a solution to the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to address the Iranian missile issue and to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the failure of the major powers to meet the wishes of the Gulf states in the nuclear negotiations with Iran, Saudi Arabia has entered into direct negotiations with Iran.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first of its kind in GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, and to propose measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

Good
It is known as the loudest supercar exhaust in Xinshan District!
This time our team brings you this car, which is the dream of many men!
It's the Aventador LP700-4, the successor to Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the Murcielago!
The asking price is nearly RM2 million, and the road tax for a year is more than 10,000 ringgit, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
I don't know, the data says that the 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, and it's probably the editor's myvi until 30km/h when people reach 100km/h, well.
The low profile, the aggressive scissor doors, the huge air intakes scattered all around the body and the unobstructed 6.5 V12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret the Lamborghini style.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car, just Google it yourself, and the editor has sorted out some explanations that Google does not necessarily give!
It's too much attention, everyone is watching everywhere, it's very uncomfortable!(Actually, it's a bit cool)
The fuel cost for 1km is about RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
Practice the posture of getting on and off the bus, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because you will climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway)
The engine is so loud that you will be deaf when you get out of the car. (But it's still cool)
The body is too big, and it will be very narrow when parked in an ordinary parking space, and I am afraid of being knocked by the car next door when I open the door!
It's a little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (the editor said it himself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!

A car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I believe that all riders know that the Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the million-dollar range!
A few days ago, a foreign country crashed a million sports cars 911 and tens of millions of supercars Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times-Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of development for a long time, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university is crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has shouldered a unique mission that is different from other social organizations, for China's universities, it has risen in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "Mingde helps the world, cultivates Qi and governs peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "rejuvenating the country through learning".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the global competition in education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to move from a big country in higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to become one of the world's top universities in a relatively short period of time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve "overtaking in corners"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the late-mover advantage, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; The third is to give full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen the goal-driven, gather consensus and work together, optimize the allocation of resources, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate its catch-up with and surpass the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is important to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in one place, and each school must demonstrate its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its strengths.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, school-running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running the school: first, highlight the characteristics of cultivating innovative and entrepreneurial talents, and build the integration of science and education. The second is to highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; the third is to highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "diligence, moral cultivation, discernment, and truthfulness", and the common values of "Haina River, Enlightenment and Virtue, Enlightenment and Virtue, Enlightenment and Virtue, and Establishment of Our Country" constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural height, and gather spiritual strength, with rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "the world's talents are used by me", and is manifested in the high-quality concept of learning from the world's famous schools to run schools and educate people; "Enlightenment and Virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that universities should not only pursue truth, but also receive the cultivation of virtue and the tempering of personality; "The people before opening things" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the innovation of knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, but also manifests itself in reform and development, reform and innovation; "Tree Our Country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and says that universities should always share the glory and disgrace with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of operation.
"The wise hear in the silent, and the clear see in the invisible."
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we should adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university can stir up with the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation, so as to provide inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

At a time when NFT is rapidly out of the circle, a new concept has emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to earn a steady income in the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet raising game based on blockchain technology, integrating a variety of gameplay including NFT, and is currently the most traded NFT project, with more than $3 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity has a daily revenue of more than $8.2 million, which is close to "Honor of Kings".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that it had more than 1 million daily active users.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has brought a new "palytoearn" model to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest impression is the choice of enterprises in the track, that is, the choice of investment target industries, first of all, we must choose industries with large growth space, at least 100 billion or more market size; secondly, we should choose industries with good future growth, and consider industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, we must choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the market size, how long the track is refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing to do is to sum up 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right", that is, to do things right.
Strategy is about "doing the right thing".
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lies in landing, and on top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on the basis of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking), for example, on the basis of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking), and on top of increasing activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right campaign KPIs to achieve the right campaign goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, In addition to improving DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
After 12 years of existence, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, made Bitcoin legal tender, the first time that Bitcoin has become a legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares to launch a bitcoin ETF and list it on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time in eight years, marking the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital market and expand cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduced the data burden on transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in admissions at Yale and other 3 Ivy League schools-Xinhuanet
Washington, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23 to protest against the discrimination of Asian-American applicants in the admissions process of three Ivy League schools, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington that day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of elite American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three elite American universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Saunders and other scholars showed that among the three universities, Asians had the lowest acceptance rate of any ethnic group relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest percentage of Asian-American students of any Ivy League school, and Yale University and Brown University have imposed de facto racial quotas on Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency that they hope that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to stop these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also hope that the complained colleges and universities will take the initiative to take the issue and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that have been complained about have not responded.
The Asian American Education Coalition was founded in 2015 when it complained about admissions discrimination at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the appeal also includes Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational groups.

Is there a phone number to contact them directly?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province from a real estate agent, and after several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after consulting with Lin, a family member of the owner of the house, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Receipt of Deposit for the Sale and Purchase of the Factory", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit belongs to the seller, if the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled to the seller, and the two parties agree to sign the contract for the sale and purchase of the factory within one week." ”
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the sale of the factory and the payment method, resulting in the delay in the signing of the house sale contract.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
The house that he finally fancied, the deposit was paid, and the payment was ready, so he almost signed the contract "at the door", but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the failure of the parties to sign a formal contract could not be attributed to the defendant alone, and it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed, so the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant did not need to bear the liability for breach of contract for double return of the deposit.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
【Lawyer's Reminder】 The necessary duty of care should be fulfilled in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as a buyer, you should perform the necessary duty of care, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
After Chinese the "Summit for Democracy" ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Summit for Democracy" to "draw ideological lines, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, and act anti-democratic in the name of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and diverting domestic contradictions".
According to the Chinese government, "For a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions indiscriminately, and instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting, which was held virtually, was attended by the leaders of 111 countries around the world, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There were also voices of skepticism both internationally and in the United States, such as criticism of the leaders of authoritarian and authoritarian parties, such as those of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, and suspicions that the Biden administration's real intention was not to organize the summit for democratic purposes but for geopolitical purposes.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has just taken office, also participated in the video democracy summit
A statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is full of pathology, with money politics, identity politics, political party antagonism, political polarization, social division, racial contradictions, and the gap between the rich and the poor becoming more and more intense," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
In his remarks, U.S. President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, and achieve transparent and accountable governance that is more resilient to the cushions and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good." "
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted, "we must constantly renew it in each generation, and in my opinion it is the defining challenge of our time." "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges."
The United States has pledged a year-long campaign to include a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news outlets.
The United States expects countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies ahead of the physical Summit for Democracy, scheduled for the end of 2022.
"Let's all of us implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year," Biden said.

So how do you drink red label whiskey?
The editor will give you a brief introduction.
How to drink red card whisky:
Johnnie Walker Red Label Whisky is a blend of around 35 Scotch whiskies that are rich in aromatic and traditional Scotch whisky, with a rich aroma with sweet and smoky aromas.
Rich and fresh on the palate, with hints of vanilla and strong smoky malt.
The wine can be drunk directly on the rocks or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red Card Whisky entered the country, and in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Card Whisky + Coke or Sparkling Drinks such as Sprite or Sunkist have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the sourness, can bring visual pleasure to people, and when added to the drink, it has the effect of diluting the taste of the wine and changing the taste.
Red label whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar cube (granulated sugar is also acceptable), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic red cube has a slightly sour taste, which can be neutralized by the addition of sugar, while lemon will bring a fresh aroma to the wine, and of course, the sweet acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink red label whisky, you can try it as a reference, I hope the introduction of the editor can help you.
Educational thinking: how to make "scholars" and "scumbags" get their own place in university exams-Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university exam, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exam, change the type of exam questions, and make the exam truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic".
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, and different levels of learning, and learning situations vary widely.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings in the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test question type is single, the repetition rate is high, and the question is too simple, it will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Students who don't need to work may be able to pass the exam by focusing on the assault before the exam, and if they think of other ways, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there will be "scumbags" who can pass the test without investing in them, and even get high scores; "Xueba" usually never misses class, homework and notes are good, and the exam is not much higher than the "strange status quo".
From this point of view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reported that the problems in the university examination are not without reason, and I believe that this situation is not limited to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to give a thumbs up to these 3 students who wrote letters and stated them directly.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that it is not uncommon for people to prepare for exams in surprise exams, find various ways to "take" exam questions from teachers, strive to delineate the scope of the exam, and seek to get "key tutoring" before the exam.
In the author's opinion, as a kind of teaching quality evaluation orientation, the measure of passing the university examination lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific proposition on this basis.
At the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
Needless to say, whether or not you have a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline, and in terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "I learned the basics of college mathematics 20 years ago, and I am still learning it now, and it is still the focus." ”
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test question type is single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination is generally composed of question groups, and then the senior teachers of the subject coordinate the formation of the test papers, and the examination papers are also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the repetition of test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning, and the questions are normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test propositions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and question type, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability test, and at the same time carry out innovative design of the question type.
Exams are the baton of university education, and what kind of exams there are, students will have corresponding preparation plans, and in the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the student's suggestion letter and has deployed a rectification plan for the whole school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of course end examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and review links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Of course, it is necessary to introduce a corresponding system, but the effort is expensive in daily life, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the learning situation of students.
If I can't change the location of my branch, can I change it to delivery?
Then I don't have to pay more, right?

What about GPS?
Mrs. Jin Wedding Photography (South Street Store) There are no branches yet
Before taking pictures, because we didn't arrange the time, we changed the time twice, and the consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to shoot.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether it's the consultants, makeup artists or photographers are superb.
It was the first time in my life that I officially wore makeup, wow~ I can't believe that I will look so good one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry I can't remember the name) are super patient with makeup and the makeup is also natural.
The exterior scene was filmed in Jiangwan City, fortunately the weather was very good that day, I didn't feel very cold, and when I took pictures, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time, and immediately helped us sort out if it was a little bad.
The photographer is also very humorous and has a lot of fun taking pictures at the end of the day.
When choosing photos, because I saw a lot of cases on the Internet, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose the photos, really, there was no meaning for us to add photos, and none of the 24 photos in the direct package were added (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos at about the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the package of more than 7,000, and I was stunned at the time, and I was afraid that I would choose too much)
Today's photos were repaired, Lan Lan sent them to me, I looked at two of them and thought they were not very good, and they immediately helped me retouch them.
Turning over the photos my sister took before and comparing them, I think I am really satisfied with our photos, simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I really recommend everyone to go to Mrs. Xuan Hanjin to take wedding photos!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful for you, and I sincerely wish you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah were out of stock due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
KOTA KINABALU, May 11 -- The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the beginning of October, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies due to the depletion of stocks of special security papers, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairu Aminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system and will be reissued when the security paper arrives next week.
At a press conference, he explained a 10-month-long report by an online media outlet that the problem with the printing of raw paper in Sabah had been occurring.
He said the problem arose two months ago and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers who produce special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China. ”
He explained that the security paper used in Sabah newspaper paper is different from that of other regions, so it is not possible to borrow from other states.
Kairou Aminus revealed that the latest batch of security paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, and when they return to Sabah, they will immediately carry out the final stage of printing, and it is estimated that it will take two more working days (December 20) to be delivered to the applicants. ”
"Applicants will be instructed to go to the local branch office to collect the birth certificate. ”
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 copies of newspaper papers so far this year.

Education information: Beijing compresses the proportion of special students enrolled in junior high schools in 2016-Xinhuanet
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination of special students enrolled in junior high schools in Beijing was organized and implemented by the education commissions of all districts.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the enrollment ratio of special students, and the competition for special students has become more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, this year, the proportion of students with special talents from primary school to junior high school in the district does not exceed 5% of the district's enrollment plan, and the planned enrollment number is 380 students, and the proportion of students attending school does not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
All students who have sports, arts, science and technology specialties and register online are eligible to participate in the enrollment examination for special students.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone" The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic in port cities-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporter Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring those who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao ports) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those who go to land border port cities must take at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame of the above requirements is from the date when the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of port cities and announce them to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions can study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and border people on both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of the differentiated management policy by region, from one line of defense to two lines of defense for the prevention and control of spillover, is expected to move the threshold forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local clusters of epidemics in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this has exposed problems such as the lack of timely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, the non-implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, the formality of regular nucleic acid testing, the lack of sanitization of all links of cold chain items, the non-standard management of centralized isolation sites, and the lack of scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the completion of the shortcomings and weaknesses of prevention and control in port cities, and to do a good job in prevention and control without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a solid line of defense against foreign imports.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should simultaneously study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security, announce and unblock people's livelihood security hotlines, regularly check the signs and hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic daily necessities, and promptly solve and actively respond to outstanding problems reported by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the Central Government where the open land, waterway, and air ports are located, and the specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

YouTube video doxxing the truth about the 20 years of bloodthirsty killing by the U.S. military-Xinhuanet
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the Afghan war launched by the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exported American-style democracy through the war, and committed various crimes against humanity in 20 years of reckless militarism, bloodthirstiness, indiscriminate killing of innocents.
Misuse drones to strike hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort human nature, and set up killing squads.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black jails" to torture and humiliate the "suspects."
Crimes against humanity have fueled more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style war on "terror" is "more anti-terrorism, the more terrifying."
The war has brought no hope for peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's debunk the truth of the bloodthirsty killing of the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism", and expose the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article, from the perspective of business and the storage period, why the customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help canning, although the canning belongs to deep processing, does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company, here the following text may be able to explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the bagged milk powder are exactly the same as the canned milk powder, and there is no difference.
Then everyone must ask: why is the shelf life of the bag one year, while the shelf life of the canned is two years or more?
Or ask: why is there such a big difference between the price of canned and bagged bags?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
Some consumers also reacted after eating it out of this mentality, and said that the texture or taste of the canned bottle is different!
Now let me tell you the reason why it is expensive, where is the price?
Why is there such a big difference in the price of their raw materials?
Because most manufacturers take into account that if the price of bags is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or there is no profit, so what do manufacturers rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a big increase in the pricing of canned equipment to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote canned packaging, rather than bagging it.
And you think so many manufacturers have to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising every year, where does this cost come from?
You can imagine it.
With the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as: the promotion personnel of the shopping mall, the display cost of the shopping mall, the gift cost of the product, the advertising cost, etc., are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and it is canned, and its price is also rising, in fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their own products, unscrupulous means, linked with the doctors in the hospital, and they assist in the promotion of the products, from the first hearing of the profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, in fact, this practice is to harm consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder and put them in cans on the premise that you have cans at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and there is no impact on children.
And don't think that the shelf life of canned packaging is longer than that of bagged packaging, if the shelf life of canned packaging and bagging is the same after opening the package, it is just that it is not easy to preserve after opening the bag, and it is easy to deteriorate due to moisture.

Don't intimidate people at the starting line-Xinhuanet
When you visit the book market, you can often feel the popularity of success books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle" – that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" and then telling you what you need to do "what".
It is equivalent to saying that the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it" has been crossed all at once.
Because of this, these books all have one thing in common—either do it all at once, or you don't do anything at all, it's 100, it's 0, you just climb Tarzan, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" makes anyone who looks at it admit that it is "extremely correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated by the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree change", which is precisely the Achilles' heel of many people.
For people who stick to the rules, stick to the old ways, and refuse to change, you want to shout in his ear "You want to change", which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano to the cow.
The vast majority of people will show timidity in the face of the word "change", hesitate to move forward, and find it difficult to make up their minds, or they will make up their minds to "change" on the impulse of the moment and take the first step bravely, but often the good times will not last long, and they will not be able to persist for a while before they are defeated, and it is difficult to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross talk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that most vividly expresses this "universal humanity".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that makes it possible for more ordinary people to embark on the path of relative success.
At the heart of the "next best principle" is to "lower the bar" – it encourages the theory of "small wins into big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, it's okay to do just 1: because 1 is always greater than 0, and if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because it's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than nothing.
Because the threshold has been greatly reduced, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the road to success by following the "second-best principle" is a little longer.
All in all, the "best principle" can motivate a small number of people in the end, although it is ostensibly under the banner of making everyone successful, while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year-Xinhuanet
Xining, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection period in 2002.
Naked carp in Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the sixties and seventies of the 20th century, affected by factors such as a large number of human slaughter and the increasingly degraded environment of the breeding waters of naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake in 2002 were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp of Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Species of China.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and their products.
At the same time, the resources of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year through measures such as artificial enhancement and release, cleaning up the main rivers entering Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages".
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially increased and released, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The headwaters of the three rivers in Qinghai are important ecological barriers and water conservation areas in China and even in Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the western region to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued notices on the ban on fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year, and has established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

I just saw an article about menstruation, it's too long.
Give science to men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and they will have amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, on the premise of being healthy, I will come once a month more regularly.
But it's not regular enough to predict accurately, the tolerance of about a week or so needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck will overturn (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people have three days, some people have a week, some people have less bleeding, some people have a large blood collapse, some people have no reaction, some people have pain so much that the ambulance takes them away, and the dysmenorrhea will change over time.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end, and all that can be done is to use a sanitary napkin or tampon to suck blood to prevent it from flowing to clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins, and taking ibuprofen as soon as possible at the beginning of the menstrual period can effectively relieve the pain of the month, and it is useless to eat it after the onset of dysmenorrhea.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's about the end of the cycle, you will have diarrhea for some reason, and you will basically have your period within two days.
It is best to change the sanitary napkin every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, except for sleep time, the worst case is to change it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add the portion prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
(Modify it here, the tampon does not have to be changed often, about five or six hours can be changed, up to eight hours)
During menstruation, hormones may be more irritable, and during ovulation, due to hormonal changes in the body, emotions will be unstable, which is very unlucky, and the body will stumble on itself.
However, official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they do not make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood that is shed, it's the shedding of the endometrium.
The endometrium after menstruation is the thinnest, and then it slowly thickens, which can be understood as the uterus is a house, and the house is built every month (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for the guests, and the guests do not come, and all of them are demolished (menstrual discharge) and a new house is built next month, and the cycle repeats.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a few days a month, and abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants to?
But a person is born because his mother has menstruation, and menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world, and everyone should thank your mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women and said that it was dirty and shameful, and everyone thought that it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the preparation of a woman's body for giving birth to life is disgusting, and that it should not be said in public, girls stand up, don't think like that, men who have never experienced it, will not experience it in this life, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful, how can this attitude be embarrassed to face their mothers, how can they be embarrassed to want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, they really work.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, and it is more disappointing to send it wrong
You have to order a separate meal for your child
I hope that the store will check the products in their busy schedules
Is the numbness of the foot bath soaking the foot leakage?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot therapy and health care, and today the editor of Gome will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot baths are more and more loved by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan of foot baths, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health appliances such as foot baths are booming, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numb on the soles of his feet when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that when the vibration function was turned off, his father still felt numbness on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried it with an electric pen, and the electric pen actually lit up, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, and although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this long-popular foot bath does not have a clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the setting of the maximum temperature, what kind of people are suitable for, and what kind of materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, the foot bath will not have the problem of electrification, but it is not excluded that a few products are not strictly controlled when leaving the factory.
Therefore, at the time of purchase, I choose a split type foot bath.
Separation of water and electricity, without any safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take a pen and test it casually.
The opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Fair - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (all-media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of sprinting to the 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: the source of lake red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into "colorful Hunan tea".
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "three Hunan and four waters and colorful tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, green tea, dark tea, black tea and other main tea categories have taken turns to exert force, and the main tea producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism to increase the income of the majority of tea farmers.
Feng Shui takes turns, and black tea exerts its strength again.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea and picking black tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens has risen sharply.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark of "Hunan Black Tea", and Xinhua praised the "Source of Huhong".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Pavilion, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to a high mountain tea called "Binglichun" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhun, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic situation and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea fair, there are many bright spots.

Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy that aims to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "the metaphysical is the way, and the metaphysical is the instrument" in the I Ching, which is translated by the Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era) from metaphysic.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and the question of its extensions, among others.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real beings and which nouns represent merely a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
It is based on the idea that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural causes, and has been proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Whereas, methodological naturalism refers to the method of studying God without saying a word.
Spiritual philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship to the physical body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between the mind and the body.
Theory of knowledge is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic reflection and study of the moral life of human beings, where morality is defined as all the rules of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theories or criticism) and normative ethics (judging different moral views and suggesting moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior).
It examines the types of moral norms that people should follow), applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theories to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing the patterns they observe).
It examines ethics not from a hypothetical theory, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, all the moral factors that contributed to this decision, and it examines the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: Humanist Ethical Thought, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
Part II: The Ethical Thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part III: The Ethics of Politics, represented by Machiavelli et al., Modern Ethics (17th-18th century, British empiricist ethics, representative figures: Hume et al., 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representative figures: Spinoza, etc., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative figures: Voltaire et al., 18th-19th century, German academic ethics, representative figures: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representative figures: Bentham and West Kivik, etc., 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, representative figures: Li Kaier, etc, late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (irrationalist ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is a discipline that studies "the principles and criteria of valid deduction and proof".
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, retrospective reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is the study of the nature of beauty and its meaning.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for your humanitarian assistance over the past 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally appealed to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Today, most of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up to work as families.
It was your acts of kindness that helped our families through the most difficult of times.
The pandemic is raging around the world, and most donors are retiring.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation to our victims, the Tiananmen Mothers, because this humanitarian relief campaign is long overdue.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me, friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye Press: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian relief by the All-American Federation of Self-Freedom (IFCSS) and the China Foundation for Democracy (MCDF) in Minnesota.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the All-American Liberal Alliance and the China Democracy Foundation in Minnesota are two parallel organizations, and the project implementers often overlap.

Relief funds often do not reach the families of the June Fourth victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Mr. Ding, the "Tiananmen Mothers" set up a special team to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "June Fourth Orphan Education Fund", and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June Fourth orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June Fourth Orphan Elderly Extremely Poor Household Relief Fund", which has been implemented until now.
These projects are funded mainly by campus and community donations during the year of June Fourth, from the generosity of individuals, and with the support of the Democracy Foundation of Sister Universities.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Laogai Research Foundation.
It wasn't until last year, after 31 years, that the families of the June Fourth victims finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that was raised in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Human Rights in Chinese also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's suspension of the June Fourth donation is for the consideration of donors, and we are indeed some retired elderly people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement, so we would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his "To Friends" letter.
We will respect the decision of the families to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those who have been generous and brave enough to deliver humanitarian relief funds at the risk for many years.

Thank you very much for choosing our products, please take 5 minutes to read the following carefully before you use our chips:
Please check whether the goods are complete after unpacking.
If there is any missing, please contact customer service in time.
The upper cover plate of the microfluidic chip is made of PC, so do not introduce solvents that have a chemical reaction with PC.
Do not use a hand syringe to inject the chip directly, as leakage is likely to occur.
Microfluidic chips on common substrates are tested in pure water at 500 mbar (100 um channel depth) or 300 mbar (50 um channel depth) injection pressure before shipment.
The glass-based chips are tested with pure water at 800mbar (100um channel) injection pressure before shipment, and you should be careful not to collide with sharp objects during the use of glass-based chips, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
During use, please consider the viscosity of the solution and do not exceed this range, otherwise it will cause leakage.
Under the condition of pure water injection in the syringe pump, we recommend that the flow rate of the microfluidic microchip on the ordinary substrate be set below 150ul/min, and the flow rate of the oil phase should be set below 50ul/min.
Please consider the viscosity of the actual liquid to be injected, and increase your flow rate parameter value from slow to fast.
After the experiment is completed, please clean the internal channel of the general chip in time, otherwise it will be easy to cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for a long time.
If the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation, it will not be returned.
If you need a microfluidic chip that can withstand higher pressure or flow rate, you can contact customer service to customize.
The normal delivery cycle of the chip is less than 1 week, and the stock can be shipped within 24 hours after the stock is in stock, please consult with customer service before placing an order.

Thank you for the rabbit's comment Originally, I also said that the rejection of the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to come out, it was so beautiful
Thank you Dandan for your recognition, your satisfaction can make us full of power to continue to move forward, we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really amazing and highly recommended to all the guys!
Whether it is from reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production, it is impeccable.
The makeup artist is very delicate, and will match the makeup that suits you according to your style, and the cosmetics are all first-line brands.
Not to mention Mr. Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing need to line up half a year in advance.
I deliberately sought this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and I think this is also a short version for most people, and the photographer Brother Liang will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-design, a well-made team.
When it came out, we and the people around us were full of praise.
I have already recommended my girlfriend to go over, and my girlfriend is also full of joy when she just watched the negative.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will discover TA and shoot their own style, instead of being the same.
Thank you very much for Zhan Ying, Jing Ling's five-star reviews, both of them are very thoughtful, creative newcomers, we are a creative studio, as long as customers like us, we will do our best to complete, thank you for meeting and meeting

A novice programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to study on your own, after all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study on your own, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training provider is a very important thing.
First of all, we must look at the faculty of this institution, if the faculty is not strong enough, this training institution will be meaningless, of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong teachers.
Secondly, before choosing, it is best to inquire about the students from this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because I don't have a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, these will all be related to the industry you are studying or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or have graduated from the computer major, then if there is enough time, I personally recommend self-study, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but one learning cost is high, two put in more time, basically need to focus on training for 3-6 months.
But if it's what I'm talking about, it's very convenient to study on your own, and now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are a lot of training resources on station b, if you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction, get free resources, or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time cost for learning, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study, so that learning does not have to be very difficult, the teacher explains in detail, there are questions and there are special answers, in addition to learning planning or supervision is also helpful.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referral places, and recommend them to the company after studying, so that the interview process of finding a job can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my views, because I don't know your situation, so only a general introduction is not detailed, if you have anything else you want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said 1 o'clock before 1 o'clock, and I saw it all in the app

When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and happiness was made when I had it; When you grow up, happiness is a goal, and happiness is achieved when you achieve it; After maturity, I found that happiness was originally a state of mind, and happiness was achieved when I comprehended it.

Since you can't dodge, it's better to face it calmly.
The more scared you are, the more you will be struck down by difficulties, and if you rise to them, the problems will be solved.
Chinese and Saudi Arabian curators jointly held the first Saudi Arabian Contemporary Art Biennale-Xinhuanet
Riyadh, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial, the Diriyah Biennale of Contemporary Art, was officially opened to the public on December 11 in the Diriyah JAX Art Zone, located in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating in the exhibition.
The Biennale is co-curated by the Saudi Diriyya Biennale Foundation and UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Philip Tian, Director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi society's social and cultural development.
Covering an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Thinking on the Edge", "Reaching the Public", "Brave New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of works in the exhibition, including paintings, installations and performance arts, and 12 Chinese artists also attracted attention for their works, some of which used recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing's "Behind the Scenes: Endless Pictures of Streams and Mountains" (2014), in which he reconstructed a classic landscape painting from waste.
Buckley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, said he hoped that the Biennale would establish an international dialogue and give a global audience the opportunity to learn about and interact with Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community.
"The goal of the Biennale is twofold, to engage Saudi contemporary art in a global dialogue and to immerse Saudi audiences in the world of contemporary art. ”
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts-Xinhuanet
Kunming, December 12 (Xinhua) -- In order to continue to do a good job in providing employment assistance to people lifted out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently introduced relevant policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare post management to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare posts for the employment of rural groups in difficulty such as poverty alleviation laborers, which plays an important role in helping the people out of poverty to achieve employment and increase income, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of various rural public services.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly to standardize the scope of objects, fund management, post development, and post management of rural public welfare personnel recruited at the grassroots level.
In terms of post development and setting, the new regulations make it clear that the setting shall be carried out in accordance with the principles of "setting up posts according to needs, assigning people by posts, dynamic management, and total control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and job arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, stipulate that all rural public welfare post development departments shall purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the resettlement personnel of rural public welfare posts, and require relevant departments to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare posts.

2. Although the rightists had an era of ambition in history, it was not long, so it was short because if they were given a little sunshine, they would shine, and if they drank some boiling water, they would sweat.
But realistically speaking, the rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's remarks, I am very concerned about his remarks and respect Li Weidong as a person, because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I believe that the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, and the mixing of political groups, and the entry of foreign countries.
Fourth, to change or improve China's attitude of patience and responsibility for the country and the people, those who attempt to win the fire of political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk about the left.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right has a positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's remarks and analyze their ideas when it needs to, then the Left will not have this kind of creation, because what the Left wants is the dross that the Communist Party throws away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends refute the left madness while scolding the thief, and they are quite angry, I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to be reasonable with traitors and leftists, they are all tendons and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we're right, and don't try to get the thief and the left to admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: When the thief scolds you for five cents, and when the left madman scolds you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue ideals, but they become paranoid.
and ideals gradually drifted away, and even the dragon slayer boy eventually became an evil dragon.
Left and right, I think it generally refers to restraint and freedom, and China's innate genes from history and culture have led to the fact that China as a whole should be on the left.
In China, the right wing is free and focuses on efficiency and development, while the left side strengthens regulation and pays more attention to fairness and security.
At present, the general desire of society to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, the competition between China and the United States, the leftist is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, it's all over if you like it
Don't say anything, Huahua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by US imperialism have not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused "American" companies to suffer huge losses.
The US imperialists suppressed China's chip industry and required their own companies and relevant enterprises of ally countries to blockade China's chip industry at the same time, which directly led to the impact of orders and profits of global chip suppliers, resulting in a decrease in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a global shortage of chip supply chains.
Nowadays, the "lack of cores" has affected major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies and the increase in the price of mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered from it.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips", more and more technology giants in countries have begun to move towards the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently made frequent moves, and is to host the "chip summit"; it is also to invite the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and to support the local technology giants in the United States, for example, the old technology giant Intel of the United States has spent $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and opened the chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, it is very likely to steal TSMC's "job".
The reason why it is so certain is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant of the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, and will definitely be able to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement, and Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly without scruples about Intel's move to invest in building a wafer factory: Intel's construction of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou is still haunted by a grievance between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the sixties and seventies of the last century, Intel has always been the pearl of the US imperialist manufacturing industry, the top position in the world, and the hegemon in the field of semiconductors in the world.
By the 80s of the last century, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip design, manufacturing and packaging and testing were all completed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged in the face of huge production line construction costs.
In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims at the single link of "wafer processing" in its main business, does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a small minion in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously regarded itself very highly, looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then will now start to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that it was ironic for Intel to enter the wafer foundry.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm 7 years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Don't wait

Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February Erlong raised its head, Haoliyou price increase, cargo pulling incident, public opinion diffusion formed a peak, and then [exponential decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated, if there is secondary public opinion, there will be a small hump again.
They look the same as the [online public opinion evolution model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [lone peak-shaped], [jagged], and [cliff-like].
[Lone peak] means artificial heating, quickly rushing to the hot search, attracting the attention of the public; [Zigzag] means periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; [cliff-like] is the collective withdrawal, the hot search has played its "function", received a new task, and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same, and it must be the unified batch of naval forces that have received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead the war to build momentum, which ones divert attention, which affect cognition, which misleading judgments, which incites emotions, and which coercive decisions, and the black industry accounts are divided into batches and nodes, taking into account almost all the elements in the dissemination and diffusion of public opinion.
Communication is a science, putting aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will have nowhere to hide.
Wherever you walk by, you will leave traces, and we will dig them out together.

Mauritius and other countries have detected cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the new crown virus.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron strain infection in the country for the first time on the 10th.
According to the Minister of Health of Mauritius, Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person is a tourist who departed from South Africa and arrived in Mauritius on November 27, while the other infected person is a local Mauritian resident who tested positive on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who has recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After isolation and treatment in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed three cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time.
All three were students who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalized because they all had mild symptoms.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Cypriot government has continuously stepped up prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by air will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus also announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Kunbize Chipunda, said on the 9th that the country had detected three cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time.
The country's health authorities sequenced the genomes of 12 COVID-positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases of infection.

Damei 360 integrated home decoration
Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No. 156 South Huancheng Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend, because of trust, so I chose to take a look, at first my budget was 70,000 yuan for a basic decoration.
When I came to the store, I started a series of deceptions.
The first time I came to the store, I just showed them my floor plan, they didn't go to the field to measure the house, they were able to give me a quote that my 135 house 70,000 yuan can be done, and I probably showed me their materials and didn't know what brand of materials they were.
Their second trick is that you will drag you to pay the deposit as soon as you arrive at the store (and once you pay the money, you will never be able to return it, unless you have enough experience to fight with them).
When I was hesitant to pay a deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much we could give you as long as you paid the deposit today.
This is a big pit, I am a living example of being deceived, when my mind is impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan.
He gave me a quote with a lot of questions, 70,000 does not include plumbing renovations, does not include any doors and cabinets Bathroom, and these three are the bulk of the cost of the base fit.
In addition to these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in the company and asked me to sign the contract without making anything clear at first.
When I went to ask them to get my money back, they showed a lot of experience and had a small team to deal with you.
In any case, it will be the customer's problem, and they are completely out of charge.
All kinds of shirking responsibilities, there are many details, I don't want to say them one by one are tears, in short, don't choose them, because my friend is looking for them to decorate the house is also not of good quality, and you will be charged various expenses later.
Pit daddy, they are the original deceptive dragon head decoration, and now they have been changed to Da Mei, it seems that they have gone out of business and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a cheating decoration company.
In the future, when you choose, take a look at these and check these consultations, because decoration is not a small money.

Isn't there any other way? For example, to change the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation, if you don't refund me in 5 to 10 days, you will definitely pursue it.

The starry sky has an appointment丨Geminid meteor shower ushered in a great deal on the 14th-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will usher in a maximum on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the night.
An Jiu, an astronomy enthusiast in Beijing, photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers have periodic comets as their parent bodies, but the Geminid meteor shower's parent body is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that was not "conceived" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science popularization, said that just like the Chinese New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A distinctive feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that meteoroids are slower, more colorful, and more frequent, making them suitable for both visual and beginner astrophotography.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast in Tianjin, photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin, December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts indicate that this year's Geminid meteor shower will reach a maximum of 150 at around 3 p.m. on December 14, with a maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant is directly above the head under ideal viewing conditions).
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'Colourful' Geminid meteor shower made a big impression, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, which will make it a little less exciting.
The 14th is the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is full gibbous, and the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, but fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiant of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the second half of the night in the few hours after the moon, but pay attention to the cold and keep warm. ”
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide field of vision facing northeast in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon sets, and then observe visually.
It is important to note that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't have to keep staring at the radiant of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
If you want to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower blockbuster', it is best to choose a wide-angle, wide-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and continuity, a tripod, battery backup and shutter release cable are also essential. ”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
In my understanding,The traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV,The difference between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning,There are mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs in an all-round way,Laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market,Or laser TV itself is a product born for large screen。
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years,The proportion of laser TVs in global shipments and sales has been increasing,80Proportion of overall TV sales of inches and above。
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140%, and it will continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball, compared with the backlight light of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
Ophthalmology experts from the Saixi Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a rigorous comparative test of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirms:Laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics,It even has a certain improvement effect in specific aspects。
At a time when vision health is getting more and more attention,Laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages,It also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market。
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TV,At present, the price of laser TV on the market is mostly more than 10,000 yuan,With the upgrading of size and light source,The price is gradually rising。
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TVs and projections cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology,The projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment,It can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance,The space required is not large,And the host is small,Occupy a small space。
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is also longer.
In addition,Many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with true4KThe ultra-high-definition picture quality、Artificial intelligence system、Bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies,It can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience。
It's not about pseudo demand,It's the product of demand segmentation,On picture quality and input-output ratio,Laser TV is not a dish for audio-visual players,If you want to take into account the lack of a large screen and the viewing environment,You can try,Everything has pros and cons,After weighing it, you can judge it yourself,I'm afraid to listen to one side of the word。
To put it simply, ultra-wide-angle close-focus projectors, laser TVs, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to get close to the screen, which does not meet the optimal optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of microstructured Fresnel screens is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point,I particularly hate projection manufacturers to take diffuse reflection is good for the eyes as a selling point,Please,The light on the curtain that the eye can see is direct light for the eye,You diffuse reflection to the ceiling,The eye can't see it,If you have to compare the real LCD TV, it is also diffuse"Direct",Isn't the ceiling illuminated when you open the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflected, it will not be like it at all.
It is precisely because of the hot spot (light spot) effect of high-gain screens that is overlooked, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eye at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Wenzhi Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio Preferred Quality Store There are no branches yet
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the young lady sent me the optional time arrangement, and the reply message was more timely~
Before I went, I saw the shooting works in the store, and more of them were outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
After the day arrived, I briefly communicated my thoughts with the young lady, and very patiently helped me try on two sets of clothes that I was tangled into, and finally decided to start makeup and styling~ The photographer will put some props before shooting, will guide the action, and strive for perfection in every detail.
But maybe I didn't talk to me about the specific shooting ideas, so the shooting was not the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After the shooting, the photographer will help select the photos and exchange the post-production style, which feels very careful.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, sit back and wait for the effect~
The second time I won the photo overlord meal event~ Most of the clothes in the audience can choose one piece to shoot.
In the end, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer in charge of shooting is the younger brother of the post-95s, I feel a little green, I hope to give more advice in the future in terms of customer shooting action guidance~ Very talkative, the shooting process is more pleasant.
Wenzhi Visual Aesthetics Photography Museum Preferred Quality Store Reply
It's on the homepage, let's take a look at Queenie~
When I arrived at the store, I filled in the name and phone number and then chose the clothes, the wedding dress can be chosen, I changed three or four sets of clothes and was quite patient, I made up for a long time after the selection, and the service attitude was good, and the back shooting will teach you how to pose, that is, the feeling of shooting out of the face is so big, the refinement is said to be half a month, and it will be sent in three or four days, and it feels like there is no difference from the original film
【Environment】Overall is fine.
There are plenty of clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup positions, and inside is the studio.
【Service】Very warm and attentive.
The stylist is quite patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you movements.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also offer to reshoot.
[Experience] may be a bit too much, the original double eyelids were pasted with three eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrow is also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who don't paint their eyebrows every day.
The photo was given for ten days, but the P picture effect was not very satisfied, and I felt that the double eyelids were still very obvious.
Because I don't know what style I wanted, I tried two sets and picked and chose a black dress The young lady said that this set is more Hepburn retro style
After choosing the clothes, I started to do the makeup and hair, the hairstylist and the makeup artist were super patient, and I was very satisfied with the results
After I finished my makeup and hair, I started to take pictures, and the photographer instructed me to pose throughout the whole process, and the process was very relaxed and harmonious
After filming, I carefully selected four favorite ones when the little brother said that the film would be completed within 15 years, and the ending was very satisfying~
It's been 3 days since I heard back...... Since your system doesn't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The weirdest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I make a payment
I now have to pay for shipping every time
Can I waive it first and then charge my monthly fee after you have finished investigating?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Little Umbrella is an internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, it must meet three key words: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the past 3 years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million before it can be established, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very harsh, summed up to have strength, to be approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks in the country), shareholders must have a good style, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, the policyholder does not need to question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these three thresholds, not all insurance companies can reach.
At this point, it's not bad and it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Mario No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance, the claimant and underwriter are Hetai Life, and Little Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of payment mode: the products of the Internet platform, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesmen's wages, are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supports monthly payment, reduces the payment pressure of the policyholder, and can leverage the insurance to the greatest extent.
That's pretty good.
Can be considered.
From the point of view of salesman professionalism: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very professional industry, many Internet product customers can insure themselves, there will be a lot of misunderstandings, in the health notice and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when insured, feel that they are healthy or compliant, so it is easy to have a lot of hidden dangers in claims, and there is a risk of being denied.
I myself have done insurance telesales in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, unreliable is people, Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are many sales misleading.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance and send a mobile phone, and receive 60,000 critical illness insurance for free, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy and light, and will not tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month is required to be charged according to the normal fee, ranging from tens to 200, and many customers deduct fees for one or two years What they bought is not clear.
thought that it could cost 1 yuan, and the insurance company paid 6 million (pie in the world).
Free mobile phone is sent only by the special policy number segment such as 6666, 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, you will not redeem it, and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for the policyholder) to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance for free, which is short-term, if you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of a real critical illness, what can 60,000 do, you can't solve the problem, and your future life will start to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So on the whole, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are more cost-effective than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers myself, underwriting offline products, and saving 2,000-3,000 yuan/year in premiums per person.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
I: Minya insurance broker, has 3 years of experience in business management training, served nearly 1,000 corporate users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, before applying for insurance, I will start from the needs of customers, tailor-made insurance products for customers, insured, shop around for customers, try to strive for the best underwriting results for customers, after insurance, for customers to do policy sorting, policy trusteeship, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer will be helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance procedures after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance is not too "ceremonial", and there may not even be a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract in the slightest.
This model is a bit similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but there will also be a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, that is, the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, and when we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?

No problem, remember no need to arrange a redelivery, I have purchased it separately and do not want to waste it
Thank you for your help
I have always been and still oppose any form of slander and abuse, let alone accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing we should resist is this uncivilized style.
From your Facebook friend requests, to ridiculous posts, to your attempts to post my home location and father's name on social media, I've taken a non-responsive stance.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to unscrupulously discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as appearance, figure, good birth, what kind of strawberries are planted in the bed, whether to insert or not, I... Forget it.
Later, I received messages from a number of friends about you uploading a photo of you on your Facebook account and comments about sexual harassment.
I'm sorry, but as a girl, I can't be silent anymore.
After the news of my police was uploaded, you did not restrain at all, but became more and more arrogant.
It doesn't matter what political background you are, and no matter what status you are, in our society, you need to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue to make this ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks, you can continue to say that you just care and care about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your plan or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't, and I can't, stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need to be judged on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think of any girl who would want to be humiliated so much in order to be famous.
My friend asked me, are you okay?
I said yes, and you won't believe it.
I don't think there will be any girl who can say that she is okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who do not have even basic virtues would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is at ease in people's hearts.
I've taken a screenshot of a message for your comments
You posted it yourself, no one should be able to impersonate you
All I can say is that you are the public enemy of civilization
Smile knowingly
Vietnam People's Daily - Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two main sessions were held during the 3rd Vietnam Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, with discussions focusing on two major themes: digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, and digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the pandemic.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th, which is the second water green comprehensive service area in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River officially operated after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province was put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam 2022-01-17 Duowei pro-CCP media Duowei reports: The latest news on Sino-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China, and the U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
On January 9, satellites spotted the USS Carl Vinson near the Balabac Strait, according to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea to the Sulu Sea and is strategically important in the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, there is also the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
For the first time, the USS Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently deploys in the Asia-Pacific region the USS Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the missile destroyer "Stokedahl".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three U.S. aircraft carriers are assembling around China.
(Weibo @南海Strategic Situational Awareness) Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China and the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam On January 17, 2022, the flight path of the US carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @南海Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base Guam on Saturday (January 15).
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China and the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam This is a signal to allies and enemies in the growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, the analysis said.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 80s of the 20th century.
Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China, The Most Powerful Weapon Rarely Visits Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China on Fiery Cross Island in the Spratly Islands.
The visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, the U.S. Navy said in a statement.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thundering Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Thundering Submarine" "the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad", a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles based on the continental United States, as well as bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads, such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to a friend about Meta's recent 26% plunge and its market value evaporating by $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that he was "facing unprecedented competition".
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising network", and many apps are connected to Meta's ads and monetized through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will be obvious that users will allow apps to access their information, and most people's normal reaction will definitely not be.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies that do overseas business.
Meta has about a few hundred people in its Hong Kong office and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta has made a lot of money from Bytes in the first two years.
Various domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise to Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it lately, but it's certainly not going to be any better than before.
The stage of large-scale cash burning by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenues, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only looking at income, but more importantly, looking at what the future expects.
Clearly, Meta's expectations weren't enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke about the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current prosperity, with an annual revenue of $100 billion to $200 billion, in fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis, and compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good and safe moat.
Although several of his social software now have a relatively high daily activity, and they are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, and the subversion is a blink of an eye.
The unattainable concept of the metaverse has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company and constantly looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice is wrong and is a point of no return The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
