A report released by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 26 June noted that Iran has begun using advanced centrifuges to accelerate production of hydrogen, further violating the 2015 nuclear deal with the world powers.
An IAEA report notes that advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility are being accumulated or are ready to accumulate.
Since US President Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran has been gradually violating the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal with the superpower.
According to the agreement, Iran can only refine its nuclear weapons with the first-generation IR-1 centrifuge.
Other signatories to the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have tried to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
Japanese Foreign Minister Mao Zedong met with Russian Foreign Minister Ravrov on a visit to the United States of America, where he confirmed that he would advance peace treaty negotiations including territorial issues, including the development of relations between the two countries in broad fields such as politics and economics, and the two sides agreed to coordinate Mao's visit to Russia as soon as possible.
This is the first time Maumou has been in charge of negotiations for a peace treaty with Russia since he became foreign minister.
Mao told Russia that it would like to really open up the negotiations, including the joint economic activities of the Northern Four Islands.
According to the Japanese government, the talks were not yet open to a detailed discussion of territorial issues.
At the December 2018 summit in Jemen, Russia, the foreign ministers of both countries confirmed the approach to accelerate negotiations as the head of the two countries.
During the meeting, the two foreign ministers welcomed the progress made in negotiations on joint economic activities in the areas of tourism and waste management.
茂木 expressed his hope for the tourism tourism pilot project, which is scheduled to be implemented in October, saying:  Hopefully the successful implementation will encourage the next step

The women's squad is hoping to defend the World Cup in advance!
On 27th, in a match against the Netherlands women's team, the Chinese team was defeated by their opponent in a two-game win, eventually beating the Netherlands 3-1 to win nine games.
The World Cup is coming to an end, and although the championship is in sight, the Chinese women's team is still not to be taken lightly against Serbia.
In the two innings before the Netherlands, the Chinese women's team performed as strongly as ever, with a 25:19, 25:16 lead, and a second down until the third inning, when the team suffered a setback.
The Dutch women's side were lagging behind, boosting the offensive side of the ball, the Chinese side were hit, and the girls were attacking, mistakes began to increase, eventually being returned to the city by the opponent at 21:25.
Seigiro Pingin also pointed out in an interview that:  In the third inning, due to a mistake we sent about 8 points.
Of course, the Dutch women's powerball team did not allow for a small gap, and China women's volleyball team prepared well before the tournament, although they missed an innings, but everything was still under the control of Lurangpin, and it was normal to play against strong teams, win and lose, and play five innings, so we told the team to focus, Lurangpin said.
In the fourth innings, the teammates adjusted their position positively, Zhang Zhengzhing fired full force on the offensive end, scoring 8 points in the one innings, giving the team a victory.
The match so far, 11 rounds of the match, currently with only two rounds left, the Chinese women's team, although one hand has already touched the trophy, did indeed ring the bell to the Chinese women's team in the match against the Netherlands: the more critical the moment, the more effort should be made.
In another match on 27th, Russia and the United States women's team scored five innings, the United States team failed to score three points from their opponent, thus, the Chinese women's team could advance to the first round of the defence as long as they scored three points in a match against Serbia.
All sorts of situations are developing in a favorable direction for the Chinese women's section.
However, while the Serbian team is missing the sixth-most dominant team, this does not mean that they will easily pass three points to the Chinese team.
From the current scoring form, the Serbian team is basically undefeated, which means they can easily put on a lineup against a Chinese women's team, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win, and the situation may turn upside down instead.
In addition, the substitute Serbian team was not the lamb of the slaughter either, having previously played the Dutch team in the first leg of the two World Cups, the Serbian team ultimately 3:2 reversed the Dutch all-rounder squad, thus showing the depth of their squad.
Before the third stage, Lurangpin also said that both teams were not good against each other:  Osaka's match will be very difficult, but we must still be prepared as before, seriously.
Now that the crown has been blown, the race has really entered the heating phase.
As for the strength-based lineup, the Chinese women's team is all over the competition, just the last straw, and to see if the women's girls can play at a normal level, releasing themselves as much as possible on the field.

More than 100 people with disabilities who took part in the event were mostly on the first boat.
56-year-old Zhengzhong is a crippled man, with both legs uncomfortable, and rarely comes out.
He said:  Today, for the first time, I board a cruise ship, I can see the magnificence of the Yangtze River from a distance, I can feel the development of the Yangtze River, I am so excited, I can't forget it.zh

However, if the hero walks around, he seems as ordinary as you are.
隆平, dipping into research, cultivating good crops underground, making tens of billions of people no longer hungry, and working hard, like an old farmer who likes to grow in the fields;南仁东, struggling to make China's top scientist, a man, a woman, a man, a woman, do one thing in his life, living in the cold mountains of Guizhou, and the old man in Zhizhong; Zhou Yu, a red scientist, a blind village boy, an old man still like a red child, learning to read the West, on top of a messy white meeting, learning to read the heart, enjoying the red-haired laugh;, a half-day filmmaker, nineteen nights and six nights in a row, still playing the old lady in a circus, who is not a good-looking cat, who is
They, seeking to be kind, live a simple, simple and persistent life, so long as they are immersed in the unintelligible and unintelligible work of their own, they easily get ahead, regardless of their reputation, wealth and prestige.
As in the novel, the Tao Lin Temple is dedicated to the Saitake monk, who, though he is well versed in martial arts, is not happy or sad.
Every 扫地僧, every red heart, has a homework behind it.
The responsibility of the home country lies not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hearts of billions of people.
Once upon a time, a high school girl was a word that was taken by the netizens, and when a hero passed by, there was always someone sitting by the side of the road clapping, I didn't want to be a hero, I wanted to be the one sitting by the side of the road clapping.
In fact, when a hero and a hero applaud, there is no contradiction.
Those who cheer along the way also transmit heat and light, and themselves are also light emitters.
Ordinary people like you and me, there are always some luck in life, some moments, some sunsets, and heroes in the making.
Shanghai's excellent judge, Hua, shouldered the responsibility of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting, the media room teacher was allowed to tell his story, received countless newspaper letters a year, from no fault of his own, to make the simple things better, which are not simple, and the judges of Hua's court will give a standing ovation to this old, monastic, 扫地僧派.
It's a battle between heroes, one hero applauding another hero.
The Saung-Teng monks have little wool temple, the water field in the Zhongqing, the experimental field in the Nanjin-dong, the stage in the Zhongqing, the platform in the Zhongqing, the platform in the Zhongqing, the heroic role, not only in the effort, but also in the better environment and the mechanism of motivation.
For example, China's Chinese eyelids, for example, now seem to be a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese tech industry was still in a difficult climb, and novelist 慈zh欣 had not yet begun writing 三体.
The largest telescope of its time, the single-beam radiation telescope in the valley of the U.S. island of Puerto Rico, with a diameter of 350 meters, is considered the world's largest irradiated telescope.
The then-Chinese radiation telescope, with a diameter of less than one tenth of an inch, was used.
While in Japan, Nanjin-dong, who enjoys world-class scientific research and salary conditions, insisted on returning home, bringing back an almost crazy idea: to build a new generation of radiation telescopes in China, receiving more messages from outer space!
China is a waste of time, and investing heavily in playing Stars?
The country trusted in the southern region of the country, and the construction of the project began.
It took 12 years to complete, and 9 years to complete.
With a capacity of 500 meters, China has made an unprecedented scientific breakthrough, one of the world's greatest.
So, the tears of heaven and the southern Indians were bursting, and the Republic of the Grand Duchy was still standing.
With the confidence of the state, the goodwill of the people, the Narenzh Dongs have the chance to become the heart and soul of the people of the country.
There are young talents, white-haired heroes, people cheering along the way, a country like this is beautiful, beautiful and harmonious.
 Garbage classification education first introduced to the guild nursery  environmental protection from dolls to crawlers
On the 27th, a kindergarten in the city of Jilin, Jilin Province, held a class on garbage classification, teaching children to distinguish between recyclable garbage and other categories of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time that garbage sorting has been introduced into a local kindergarten classroom.
Recently, nine departments of the province of Jilin jointly issued a work programme to promote the classification of urban living waste in the province of Jilin.
Based on the 2019 pilot for the mandatory classification of living waste in Rajasthan, the province decided to carry out the classification of living waste in suburban cities.
The city of Zhejiang is one of them.
We hope that through this event, we will achieve a family-driven, kindergarten-driven, community-driven impact, and advocate for environmental protection.
The Executive Director of the International Kindergarten for Children, which organises the event, said 丽.
On that day, the gardener read a letter to the Environmental Protection Initiative, hoping to start sorting garbage from children.
After the kids perform a low-carbon baby dance, they group up to play a garbage sorting game.
The instructor also issued recyclable tags for other garbage, advising children to stick the tags to the garbage can and record short videos when they get home.
The preschool has been advocating for low-carbon, green environmental protection, and regularly hosts environmental lectures.
The garbage disposal in the park also has garbage cans that can be sorted, marked with a garbage category.
Teachers teach children what recyclable garbage is.
According to preliminary statistics, the city of Jilin produced about 546.52 million pieces of municipal life waste in 2018, all of which went to landfills for treatment.
Of these, 329.29 million were filled, 209.23 million were burned, and 8.01 million were handled using integrated techniques.
After years of efforts, the provincial municipalities and counties have the capacity to treat life-saving waste.
In the work programme for the prevention of urban urban living waste, which has already been launched in Zhejiang Province, it is explicitly required to conduct in-depth activities for the classification of garbage into campus, in teaching materials, in classrooms, by creating garbage classification works such as songs, songs, cartoons, micro-video, enhancing interaction between students and parents, achieving a child education, influencing a family, driving a community, cultivating the effect of a new generation of newcomers.

The political legacy of Shirak Reshchev has survived.
On 26th July, local time, former French President Hilaire Zélan passed away at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in a state of unprecedented change, the political legacy left by this French politician during his reign is still worthy of our praise.
For 12 years, Chirac served as President of France in a very personal manner.
He was both a heir to the diplomatic spirit of the independent, de-Gaolist, and a staunch supporter of European integration, and a leading figure in the pursuit of the European dream.
At the same time, he was also a strong advocate of world polarization and multilateralism, a politician with a strategic outlook.
For this reason, the French media rated him as the outstanding representative of France on the world stage.
One of the political decisions that made the Syrian regime's most disgusting was the war in Iraq, led by the United States.
Under his leadership, France joined Germany in overcoming American pressure, and took the front line against the war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted, the Iraq war would lead to increased terrorist activity, making the world more dangerous.
Later, it turned out that the warning of Sirach was correct.
In a time of unilateralism in the United States, which is increasingly prominent in the wake of European integration, and back in the day, the strategic thinking and choices of the world's political and global affairs have undoubtedly had a strong revelative effect on the world.
Hirac was also a French politician who made the Chinese feel familiar and affectionate.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the golden decade of Sino-French relations, and after being elected president of France for the first time in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with a strategic view of politicians.
In 2004, with China-France establishing a comprehensive strategic partnership, China-France bilateral relations entered a whole new phase.
During the administration of President Hiraq, China and France have made breakthrough progress in rapidly growing bilateral trade, and cooperation in a number of fields, including aviation, nuclear energy, rail transport, and more.
The Chinese-French Cultural Year, initiated by Hilak, created a whole new model of cultural exchange in the history of China-France.
Shirlak's lifelong love of Chinese culture is particularly impressive.
According to his Chinese diplomatic introduction, Hilak is able to carry some poems, even accurately determine the historical dates of Chinese bronzeware.
 Regardless of whether the pyramids actually went through Egypt, or whether they actually went through China                                                                                        
In an interview with Xinhua, Mr. Hilak said: "The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems caused by China's economic growth, and China's political position internationally.
But I personally have great confidence in China.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization, its experience is sufficient to help it establish the ideals and values of achieving harmonious development, and to take its own long-term responsibility on the world stage.
I also believe that China's revival will bring new creative energy to world culture and enrich world culture.
The Sikhs are gone, but the political legacy and revelation that Sirach left to the world will live on for a long time.

The Hong Kong Special District Legislative Assembly has joined forces to oppose the U.S. Shipping Act.
A joint statement issued by the Joint Committee on 27 June by members of the Hong Kong Special District Legislative Assembly, strongly opposed the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 by the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the U.S. House of Representatives.
The statement by the 40 member-member parliamentary association said that Hong Kong's current rights under the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including the maintenance of the status of a free trade port and separate customs zone, in different areas of the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports, and in the name of China, Hong Kong's trade, cooperation and development relations with different countries and regions around the world, the signing and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, legal and business ethics, trade with different countries and regions, participated in cooperation in many relevant fields, achieved solid results and witnessed common ground.
The statement said that the move by the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs to pass the bill was not unnecessary, but merely to respond to the call of its whaling agent, as a means of grossly interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs and gaining political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong.
The House of Representatives regretted this move and strongly opposed it.
The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surplus.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and clean society make it a good destination for American businessmen and businessmen.
If the U.S. passes this bill, it will not only hurt Hong Kong and its own interests, but also make China-U.S. relations worse, to no avail, to its detriment.
The statement said that Hong Kong will continue to implement the two-state approach as before, unwaveringly, continue to enjoy the rights granted by the Basic Law, and effectively fulfill its obligations.
Whether past, present or future, Hong Kong will continue to make its contribution to the international community and international trade.
According to the European Times, the French parliament will discuss immigration reform next week.
French President Macron recently said that France cannot accept everyone, but must also strive to accept everyone properly.
Macron is trying to find a middle ground on immigration, slowing down the impending debate shock.
Recently, Macron, interviewed during a United Nations general debate in New York, said he hoped for a real two-tiered approach to immigration policy, seeking a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Macron said:  If France wants to be able to properly accept immigrants, it cannot accept all.
Macron listed four main areas of immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more effectively promoting immigration integration; welcoming and protecting all immigrants entering French territory; more effectively resettling those who entered France illegally and do not wish to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the AME system is the most widely discussed topic.
Macron said he hoped to be able to evaluate the system, but did not abolish it, but instead restricted it.
Following Macron's remarks, the leader of the far-right National Union, Le Pen, tweeted that Macron's expression was "empty talk".
Right-wing Republican Senator Rachel also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "moderate" but "realistic" manner, indirectly criticizing Macron.
The left-wing Socialist Party MP, Vazhlo, believes that France should accept more, better, on immigration issues, and criticizes Macron's manipulation of the issue.
The new Asylum and Immigration Act has been in force for a year, and it has led to internal disagreements within the ruling party, but has not appeased the right-wing opposition.
In the next 2022 general election, the issue of immigration policy will once again be the focus of the far right's attack, a question Macron needs to address, but he will also risk anger from the left within the ruling party.
The lower house of the French National Assembly is reportedly due to debate immigration policy from September 30 and the Senate from October 2.
There are signs that Chinese Azh shares are entering a buyout trend, with many publicly traded companies issuing shares of real-world companies.
According to the statistics of financial data service provider Eastern Wealth, as of 27th of 2019, the total amount of repurchase transactions by publicly traded companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan, well beyond the same period data of the previous year, setting a new record high for the amount of repurchase funds.
In this regard, Xuyang, Chairman of Shanghai Maikyozhong Information Consulting Limited, said that this year's overall market valuation of A shares was low, repurchasing shares at relatively low prices, favoring the efficiency of the use of funds by listed companies, and also reflecting the willingness and abundant cash flow of the listed companies to actively manage market value, which helped boost investor confidence.
Moreover, the constantly improving share buyback system has also encouraged publicly traded companies to actively buy back shares.
For example, earlier this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules for the repurchase of shares of publicly traded companies, providing detailed rules and guidance for the repurchase of shares of publicly traded companies.
According to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented plans to increase their buybacks have been mainly focused on infrastructure, real estate, information technology, and electronics manufacturing.
In addition, in terms of the repurchase payment amount, this year six publicly traded companies have repurchased over a billion yuan.
Among them, the number one is Eli's shares, which have a repurchase value of over 5 billion yuan.
How will the repurchase of shares by publicly traded companies affect the market?
Zheng Sijun, vice-dean of the Chinese People's University's Financial and Financial Faculty, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the buy-back shows, on the one hand, that the listed companies have stronger economic strength and better financial standing, are able to maintain stock price stability, give investors confidence; and on the other hand, that the listed companies and their shareholders are responsible for the company, responsible for the market, and responsible for the investor.
The former is based on good business performance, while the latter requires a higher quality of the listed companies and their shareholders.
For the capital market, these are the most fundamental elements.
The repurchase of shares of publicly traded companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence, and has a supporting effect on the price of shares of publicly traded companies.
According to the Eastern Securities Research Report, based on the expected number of stock buybacks undertaken by the publicly traded companies since the beginning of this year, and the average price of shares already bought back, the growth capital of the stock market in the year is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan.
After nearly two months, the National Historic Preservation Unit announced the completion of the massive mural work on the 26th of January, which will reopen to the public during this year's National Day celebration.
The Postnatal Scenes is a large traditional mural painting that fully reflects the life of the ancient Chinese.
Approved by the relevant national authorities, it was drawn by the director of the Tianjin Citizen's Museum from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that this mural depicts more than 30 stories of the afterlife, the birth of the heavens, the passage of the sea, the rise of the heavens, and the life of Zhuzu, 358 characters who reproduce the life of Zhuzu.
Quang Kwin-shu said that in recent years, the heavy rainfall in the summer, the dry winter, and the wet and dry weather have caused the mural to crack, with the cracks accounting for 60% of the total wall area.
In order to protect, rescue and restore the wall paintings from the ancestral ruins, the Ancient Cultural Street Management Committee and the Tsunsuan Palace in Tianjin City's South Kuai District have begun restoration work on the Tsunsuan Palace and the wall paintings inside the palace.
The restoration project was carried out by the ruler of the country, who invited four famous national painters to participate.
The restoration work was done in accordance with the principles of the old as the old, while also making local adjustments to the original mural, with the addition of a complete restoration of the original mural where it was not so perfect.
In the repair, we also innovate and experiment with color, material, pencil and ink.
After restoration, the original mural style retains its appearance, spirituality, spirituality and artistic style.
The Tianfu Palace, originally named Tianfuzh Palace, commonly known as the Tsuifu Palace, which has been rebuilt several times, is the oldest building complex in Tianjin city district and one of the earliest surviving Chinese Zhou
On September 25, a ceremony to launch the cargo at Beijing Daxing International Airport was held in Beijing.
The building of the Beijing Daxing International Airport terminal is known as the "Seven Wonders of the New World".
Currently, Beijing Capital International Airport is in a state of super-load operation, carrying more than 100 million passengers last year, becoming the second-largest passenger-throughput airport in the world after Atlanta International Airport in the United States.
By 2022, the passenger throughput at Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to reach 45 million times, representing 20% of international flights; by 2025, the passenger throughput will reach 72 million times, representing 30% of international flights.
As a new state gateway, how cool is it?
Beijing Daxing International Airport, located between Beijing Daxing and Guangyang, Guangzhou, Tianjin, is the largest airport in the world currently under construction.
Its terminal building has a steel roof-covered floor projection area of 180,000 square meters, the size of 25 standard football fields.
Beijing-Dazing International Airport is the first airport in the world to have two arrivals and two departures.  F1-F4 are international arrivals, domestic arrivals, domestic departures, international departures respectively.
 High-speed connections outside the terminal and a two-level bridge at the airport, respectively, corresponding to the terminal F3、F4      international departure and upward flight, domestic departure and dual flight.
The first flight of Beijing Daxing International Airport opened the Beijingzh双 Airport era.
The new airport is positioned as a major international air hub, a new source of energy for national development, a regional integrated transport hub for the construction of the new Zhongshan Zhong, and as of now, a total of 66 airlines have planned to enter Beijing Daxing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 domestic and foreign airlines in the Hong Kong and Macao regions, each receiving regular airline flight approvals.
In the 2019 winter season, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, its China Inland 101 routes, international 15 routes; covering 112 international routes, including 97 domestic routes, and 15 international routes.
This formed a coordinated development, moderate competition, and a highly competitive international airport layout, both mitigating the operating pressure of the capital's airport capacity and better meeting the urgent need for the rapid growth of air transport in Beijing and the surrounding region, effectively enhancing international competitiveness of our national aviation industry.
To ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport takes full account of the geographical location, the airport's relationship with surrounding airspace and operating environment, the airport runway for the first time in the country uses a full-directional layout, adopts the world's largest air-tube automation system, establishes the largest terminal control zone in China, and maximizes air traffic efficiency.
Airports of this size in the country for the first time use a domestic baggage automation and information management system, adopt innovative baggage transfer models, and improve the efficiency of baggage handling systems.
The first flight of Beijing-Dazing International Airport, predicted to be very successful.
This new airport, which has created more than 40 international, domestic and first-class airports, with a domestic production rate of more than 98 percent, will inevitably have a direct, indirect economic impact on the surrounding industry, and will inject a near-zero of energy into Beijing's economic development.
Mawar suspended the November General Assembly and proposed lowering the party age to 16.
Mawar suspended the Central Congress of the Communist Party of China from November to November, and proposed to amend the party's party charter to lower the party age to 16.
As Congress passed the lowering of the voting age for general elections, Mawar announced the 66th Central Congress to be convened this year, and proposed amendments to the party's party charter, including lowering Mawar's age to join the party, from the current 18 to 16.
Chairman of the Mawar General Assembly, Nadhuk Sri Khyber Singh, said that the Mawar Central Committee was scheduled to convene the Central Congress on November 2 and 3 this year, but due to the re-election of the Danbi Ai Congress seats, the date of the Congress may change.

The committee secretary of the Shandong original-sushi light county, Wang Ber祥, is a member of the rich people of the Shandong original-sushi light county, Fuzhmian Red Heart.
Wang Ber祥, a Shinto Shūzhū-san, born February 1943, joined the work in 1967, and previously served as township party secretary, county commissioner, mayor, and other positions.
In 1986, Wang Bershing-jin, the secretary of the Suzhou County Commission in Shandong Province, then the poor county of Suzhou, was elected.
During the five years of the life of Shūshū, Wang Bishiangyeo concentrated his efforts on three things: to promote the industrialization of vegetables; to develop Shūshū North Salt; and to lay the foundations for the industry, thus making Shūshū people lift their pockets.
The Shūshū light farmers have a vegetable tradition, and have also learned the lesson of cultivating vegetables.
In the early 1980s, the abundance of the vegetables the Shushoku farmers had sown could not be sold, and the soil was rotten.
Researchers have found that grabbing vegetables is key to getting them distributed.
Shu Shu Shuo took the lead in building a wholesale market for vegetables, paving the way for a market economy to develop.
The party's cadres should lead, and all the losses in the county are borne.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Bershing, 17 party members such as Wu Juzhura Wang Li Yi set up 17 winter-heated vegetable shelves, which in that year the village raised 17 million yuan.
Subsequently, a promotion group was formed in the county, and under the guidance of Wang Beshing, Wang Li Yi toured the towns and cities; in the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable shelves were promoted, after which the trend spread to the entire county and even the country.
For thousands of years, the land of 1.600,000 people in the north of the country, except for salt, has been the land of Asha Hai.
The local population lives a very difficult life.
There is a vegetable shelf in 寿南, so what can you do?
Wang Birzhshan organized tens of thousands of people to fight the battlefield, camping in the wilderness, for a total of forty-five days.
Wang Bershing and the county's leadership staff ate all at work, driving the same wagon as the civilian workers, and camping, the people saw them all with their fingers outstretched, their eyes worshipped...... At that time, the Shushi North developed 150,000 ponds, 200,000 salt fields, 600,000 cotton fields, and developed a salt-coated treasure chest.
In July 1986, Wang Berzh祥 first attended the Industrial Conference of the City of Zhejiang as County Commissioner.
During the meeting, a table of industrial economic figures for the 12 counties of Zhejiang was published: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
But if the raw salt is removed, the pure industrial output of Sushi Light remains at only 119 million yuan, ranking third in the number of discounted units.
Wang Berzh祥, with a company of more than 70 men, ran to the field to change his mind.
Less than a year later, the entire county has invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.
From then on, every year, the organization of the Zhengzhou Group of Experts, to the deep sea, the East of China and Shanghai, etc.
Shūshū shortages of enterprises, and more of them are entrepreneurs.
Wang Bershing hosted a conference call with the theme of: "Managers of publicly selected factories throughout the county, 40 talented entrepreneurs who stand out, are promoted to the top of the industry".
In 1991, the country's 100 best county counties were ranked by the Sushi Light, and Wang was appointed deputy mayor of Zhejiang.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable shelves, 1.2 million cotton fields, salt fields, ponds, 4,854 businesses, more than 100,000 households, and a popularly recognized dry troop.
On September 26, local time, State Council member and Foreign Minister Wang Zheng-hwan chaired a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of China and the African member states of the Security Council in New York.
Foreign Ministers of Côte d'Ivoire, the current African Security Council member, Tanno, O'Yono, the Minister of External Affairs of Equatorial Guinea, South African Foreign Minister Pandor and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the candidate member states, Niger, and Tunisia's Foreign Minister, Jenavi, attended the meeting.
Wang Zheng put forward four recommendations on strengthening cooperation between the two sides in the Security Council.
First, by uniting forces.
The biggest challenge to the current international situation is unilateralism, the direct consequence of which is that the basic principles of international relations are challenged, the role of the United Nations is impacted, and the interests of large and small developing countries, including African countries, are damaged.
To meet this challenge, we need the strength of hand-to-hand, shoulder to shoulder, and unity.
At the Security Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, focusing on the share of not just three votes, but the entire African continent.
China and Africa stand together, not only with four votes, but will move other countries to follow, influence and shape the Security Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China and the African members of the Security Council have established a coordination mechanism zh3+1, to make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, resolving disputes through consultation.
China has always advocated political solutions to hotspots, Africa has a good tradition of consultation, and has had successfully organized regional and subregional organizations in Africa.
Many of the complex issues on the agenda of the conference, particularly the African hotspots, were largely the root causes of colonialism, some directly related to external factors.
We must work together to use the sixth chapter of the Charter of the United Nations, to play the role of the United Nations in mediation, mediation, and so on.
Third, self-empowerment is based on self-empowerment.
African countries and peoples know best about African problems, and Africa also has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
When addressing the issue of Africa's hotspots, the UN Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa's will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, should encourage and support solutions that come from Africa.
China is willing to work with the non-African countries to strengthen coordination and to firmly promote the development of African capacity for autonomous peaceful action.
Fourth, through development, governance is fundamental.
China and the wider African countries are both developing countries, and we must insist on putting economic and social development first, supporting each other in their respective paths of development.
China is willing to build a common road with the African Union's 2030 Agenda, the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, closely link African countries' development strategies, help African countries build their development capacity, and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
Together we must promote the United Nations' increased investment in Africa's development.
Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak has erupted again, China has and will continue to provide all possible assistance, providing all possible human and material assistance, and is willing to coordinate with African countries, mobilize the United Nations, WHO, and others to increase aid capacity, and to play the role of the UN mission to stabilize Congo (DRC).

Twenty minutes later, Ms. Chenzh and her baby finally arrived at the maternity ward of Hubei Provincial Women's and Children's Hospital.
Hospital security saw the panicked couple and their baby, and immediately notified the maternity ward, the deputy chief medical officer Zhang Chei, and four doctors and nurses, who were carrying the delivery bag and the birth plate, to the ground.
 At the time, the midwife was half-legged on the driver's seat of the car, with sheep's and blood water beneath her, and a baby boy standing next to her, still tied to a belt.
Zhang asked if the baby was a 32-week-old preterm baby, on the way the parents couldn't get the baby to cover the package, the early autumn morning was already cold, he had skin white, no crying, legs soft.
Zhang Ji rushed to the co-driver to give the baby a baby treatment belt, drilled in from the cockpit, quickly opened the baby bag, wrapped the baby with a thermal towel and a wrapper inside the baby bag, and gave the baby a clean airway, then carried the baby up to the 12th floor of the infant ward.

A penalty shot scores three points maximum?
Beijing time, June 27,NBA Development League announced a new rule for testing penalties, with each penalty only starting once, and the score will be determined by the offence.
O'Neill is among the NBA stars, with a very low penalty shoot-out rate.

Wuhan is promoting the smart transformation of industrial enterprises and is granting a maximum of 20 million yuan in grants.
The reporter learned from the press conference held on 27th of January from the Wuhan Municipal Government's press office that the city has been accelerating industrial smart transformation since this year and implementing transformation grants of up to 20 million yuan.
To date, more than 800 industrial enterprises have collected information on the needs for intelligent transformation.
Zhang Redzhong, deputy director of the Wuhan City Economic and Information Administration, said that starting this year, Wuhan has launched an industrial enterprise smart transformation action plan, providing free consulting diagnostic services and solutions to industrial enterprises of the size and size that are in demand, and fully implementing a new round of high-level enterprise technology transformation.
As planned, Wuhan will openly select a set of specialized diagnostic services agencies each year, through open-label, questionnaire, door-to-door filing, and so on, to conduct an intelligent conversion needs survey of all industrial enterprises of all sizes throughout the city.
To date, more than 800 industry-specific smart conversion needs have been collected, accounting for nearly a third of the market-sized industrial enterprises.
Five city-wide diagnostic platforms have organized teams into units in enterprises, carrying out one-on-one field evaluations and programming arguments.
Zhang Red said that the city is currently organizing 373 smart transformation projects with a total investment of 297.6 billion yuan, the first 5G smart production line in China, Motorola, the first smart mobile phone production line in China, Wuhan Siemens Transformer, the first mass-produced satellite production line in the country, the first biotechnology-leading new veterinary product line, the first smart workshops and smart factories in the industry, including the smart home IoT smart production line in Europe, the first smart home IoT smart production line in China, and the first smart factory in the country.

These include investments in industrial enterprises that have been smartly transformed, completed in practice; including equipment, hardware and software investments, which are given 8% of the grant, a maximum of 20 million yuan in transformation grants.
At the same time, financial institutions such as joint venture and venture capital firm Wuhan, which specialize in providing personalized financial services for industrial enterprise smart transformation, greatly alleviate corporate financing pressures.
If the Trudeau collapses, will he be able to succeed in re-election?
This time, he dug out a crater with a crater on his head, which he himself dug out a little bit.
Recently, Canadian media have repeatedly exposed several old photographs of current Prime Minister Trudeau, including one in which Trudeau disguises himself as a black man.
This is considered to be a clear racial discrimination, prompting a wave of racial unrest in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians are not able to afford to buy bills.
Trujillo even moved his own foot from the stone.
As political commentator Riley et al. pointed out, since the rise of the anti-black face movement in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been vocal in accusing opposition or dissenters within the party of losing ground in this regard, and have repeatedly advocated that anyone who makes this mistake should be dismissed immediately.
Simply put, this time, Trudeau dug out a crater with a cluster of holes, which he himself dug out a little bit.
Trudeau was the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a handsome young man who had just begun his ministry by raising a wave of political idols.
Originally a political amateur, he fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 Canadian federal election after taking over as leader of the federal Liberal Party, gaining a valuable individual majority in the federal House of Commons.
At the time, Trudeau proposed many deafening policies and ideas, such as racial and gender equality, environmental protection, economic revitalization, and the eradication of corruption and corruption.
However, during his five years in power, he has done almost everything mentioned above.
As for the issue of Na ethnicity and gender equality, aside from this incident, he had previously been unable to speak out on a range of issues related to indigenous people, so that indigenous groups and leaders moved the protest tent to the front door of the Capitol Hill on the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada.
In the fight against corruption, Trudeau was involved in the heated "Randoland" scandal at the end of last year and early this year.
When it was exposed, he alleged major breaches of the civil engineering company of his hometown, Zhan Lanling, and pressured the departments and officials responsible for the investigation, demanding that the latter lift up their hands.
And, in fact, Trudeau was angry with the officials who disclosed the wrongdoing after the incident had grown bigger.  Wang Zhou Di, mentioned earlier, was the then Attorney General of Canada who first disclosed the wrongdoing and directly handled the case.
Although the case itself still has some suspicions, the suspect is hard to clean.
Many observers point out that the collapse of Trudeau's five-year reign was largely due to his own personal clutches, while the biggest clutches were the three strictly human rules of self-indulgence and self-indulgence.
Canada's most authoritative Angus-Redd poll data shows that since 2015, respondents who support Trudeau have slipped from more than 60% in the first place to more than 30%, while the opposition has never risen from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their party leaders did not perform as well, even a significant portion of the voters who still voted for the federal Liberal Party were still uncomfortable with the idea of the current federal prime minister, the leader of the ruling party.
On October 21, the next federal election for the Canadian federal legislature is about to begin, will Trudeau be able to repeat the spectacle of winning the general election five years ago?
The answer may be in one word: difficult.
Whether from the level of corporate competition, consumer experience, or regional aviation integration, development integration, they have a profound impact and positive meaning.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport officially opened its doors.
The Beijing-based City Development and Reform Commission informed the Xinjing Times reporter that the capital's airport is in a state of super-operation and operation, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will improve the capital's airline service capacity.
Beijing became the second city in China after Shanghai to have two airports, with Shanghai Neon Bridge International Airport serving mainly domestic aviation; Pudong Airport is similar to international shipping, and the future capital airport and Daxing Airport will also serve a more detailed service, with differentiated positioning of domestic and international airline operations.
大兴 Airport, from the point of view of business development, has a more beneficial impact on the capital's airport.
The capital airport, which in 2018 had a passenger capacity of over 100 million, is the country's top-ranked, but in comparison to the rapidly growing business demand, there is still a significant gap in traffic, especially in international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign travel, to adapt to Beijing's increasingly open and to the urban development trends that are in line with international demand, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a major international hub, with plans to meet the annual passenger capacity of 100 million people and freight capacity of 4 million.
So, two airports with no overlapping location, each targeting different customer groups, also have enough market space.
From an economic point of view, the airline operations at Daxing International Airport will obviously have a win-win effect, ease the tensions in Beijing Air's transportation capacity, accelerate the growth of passenger and cargo throughput, and create a growth cake for the capital airline's dual-core operations.
From a user's perspective, with the transit of Daxing International Airport, the future may not be focused on the capital airport, but it may also reduce a number of problems caused by the over-centricity of the route, such as increased stop-guarantee times, slower passenger boarding speeds, indirectly increased flight and passenger lag times at the airport, increased airport operating burden, reduced flight burden through the capital airport, and actually improved passenger travel experience.
According to media measurements of the time and cost of various transport routes to major international airports, such as from the southern five-lane departure to the high-speed highway directly to the Daxing airport high-speed, driving is 50 minutes, oil and return is about 40 yuan, high-speed costs 15 yuan; while choosing the rail transport metro Daxing airport line, the route is limited to 20 kilometers, 30 kilometers, ticket prices are 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan; citizens can also take a bus to and from Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport station in just 20 minutes.
Overall, there are many transportation options available to citizens to and from the airport, and costs and time are also within a more reasonable range.
And from the trend development perspective: the location of Daxing Airport is a transport hub in Beijing, so it is a bit further away from Beijing's city centre, but the radiation to Hebei, Tianjin is enhanced, more people are transported, and the economic development of Hebei, Tianjin is significantly affected.
In the future, passengers from Hebei, Tianjin and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international airline services provided by Daxing International Airport, as is evident from the traffic planning at Daxing International Airport.
The transportation facilities at Daxing Airport are very well maintained, in addition to the new airport line at Daxing Airport in Beijing's city centre, there are also several highways connecting Daxing Airport and surrounding areas.
Just as passengers from Guangdong, Guangdong, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, and other cities can travel to Guangzhou's Weiyuan Airport via the Guangzhou, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou highways, residents of Beijing's surrounding corridors, and Xi'an New Zhi, will also benefit from the airport, which provides convenient and efficient aviation services.
As can be seen, the air transportation of Daxing International Airport, not only adding a few runways and a few planes, whether from the level of corporate competition, consumer experience, or regional aviation integration, development integration, has a profound impact and positive meaning, not only concerning the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, but also diversifying the choice of departures for the residents of Beijing, driving the quality of services to Beijing's shipping industry further to improve, further promoting the development process of the regional aviation integration, and stimulating the economic and commercial development of the surrounding areas of Daxing Airport.
Therefore, for the air transportation of Daxing Airport, we are economically not only considering the small costs of individual development, but also the overall costs of development.

The 2019 Forum on Economic and Social Issues in Vietnam was held in the province of Hangzhou.
德坚zh, deputy director of the Economic Committee of the Vietnamese Parliament, revealed that earlier this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new ups and downs and continued to maintain a growth trend.
The forum focused on discussing the socio-economic issues that were highlighted in the months leading up to 2019, and proposed measures for socio-economic development in late 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, the participants exchanged views and views on four topics: the state of economic development in 2019 and the impact of some of the FTAs; some of the key issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019, key issues in Vietnamese social culture in 2019, and forecasts and recommendations for Vietnamese economic and social development in 2020.
It is generally believed that in the first few months of 2019, global economic growth slowed, risks and challenges increased.
Trade friction between major economies has further reduced global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has determined that despite the uncertainty of the global economy, with 70% of the world's economies in stagnant growth, Vietnam's economic development still has many positive results, with macroeconomic stability, effective control of inflation, and an average increase of 2.64% in the consumer price index in the first half of 2019, the lowest growth in three years.
GDP grew 6.76 percent in the first half of 2019, although it was down 7.05 percent from the same period last year, but growth remained higher than the same period in 2011-17.
When making forecasts on Vietnam's economic development trends for 2019-2020, Vice Director of the National Economic and Social Forecast Center of Vietnam, Dr. Deng Ying, said that in the context of global economic turmoil, Vietnam's economy in 2019 showed a higher growth momentum.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macroeconomic situation will remain fundamentally stable, the implementation of various free trade agreements will boost trade development, economic structural adjustment, and work to improve the business environment will be further strengthened, and due to the effects of trade friction, Vietnam's foreign export activity will decline.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and forecasting mechanism, to actively seek trade relief for Vietnamese exports, to seek opportunities to expand new export markets, to facilitate the export of various goods, such as agricultural and water products.
At the same time, inflation should be kept at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industries, supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic and ecological agriculture, etc.
The director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Gmel, Zhizhiezh, held a reception in Gmel to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
In the 70 years since the founding of the New China, China has been actively involved in international affairs, contributing to the improvement of global economic governance, promoting global co-development, increasing Chinese wisdom and Chinese programs, making important contributions to world peace and development, and bringing tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and welfare.
As the world's second-largest economy, China contributes more than 30% to global economic growth, especially through China's Belt and Road Initiative, China's deepening cooperation between provinces and territories.
He said that this year marks the opening of the 61st anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the two countries have a brotherly friendship, and that China-Cambodia mutual cooperation will be the driving force behind the local economic and social development.
The governor of Minglong province, Dzhseha, highly commended the great achievements of the new China over the past 70 years, and congratulated the result of the friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia.
Dichaiha expects both sides to continue working together to advance China's friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continuously improve the living standards of the people of Cambodia.
The friendly relations between the provinces of Goma and the provincial municipalities of China are remarkable, he said, as they have so far established friendly relations with 28 provincial municipalities in China, a large cultural entertainment project, the Goma Smile and the Goma Wang dynasty landings, the Goma-Goma Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Goma New International Airport project, special training groups for the government officials of Goma, the Goma students who go to China for studying, rural diagnosis, the development of urban roads, the white-block reconstruction of public benefits, and other projects, have been successfully implemented, and in the context of good cooperation between the people of Goma and China, the Goma people have become direct beneficiaries.
The reception was attended by Kenven Matson, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, the Chairman of the Council of the Provinces of Guangdong, the provincial governors of the 5th territorial region, the members of the Council of the Provinces of Guangdong, volunteer teachers, the members of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Guangdong, representatives of Chinese enterprises and representatives of foreign conglomerates in Guangdong.
In the small town of Yun, we witnessed the digital decade of China.
If we take the 2009 local website forum as a starting point, the 2019 congress in Hangzhou, held from 25 to 27, has been going on for a full decade.
From the concept of a cloud in the fog to the practice of cloud computing, big data, cloud computing has become one of the core technologies that support China's economic development, social management, and public services over the next decade.
At the Nungtai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Zhejiang, China, a recent quality inspector was standing next to a new colleague of AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-
It is available 24 hours a day, detection speed is more than twice that of a human, and quality assurance accuracy is stable at over 95%.
According to the company's head, this quality inspector with a camera has studied more than 40,000 sample films, and with the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language, placing a class of cells with a single cell.
This enterprise is just a shortened version of today's transformation of the cloud computing-enabled manufacturing industry.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology published guidelines for promoting enterprise cloud implementation in 2018 and proposed that by 2020, efforts to achieve significantly increased awareness and motivation of enterprise clouds, significantly improve the proportion and depth of application of clouds be made public.
Wang Zhen, founder of Ali Yun, said that today, data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge to the digital economy where data is a key element, paving the way.
At the same time, over the past 10 years, the size of China's cloud computing industry has steadily expanded.
The Chinese Institute of Information and Communication published in July this year's Cloud Development White Paper shows that the overall Chinese cloud market in 2018 reached 962.8 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2% from 2017.
Besides being a key technology supporting the industrial transformation, the digital economy, the invisible clouds have also unknowingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year's conference, the city's brain, which has made its three-year consecutive debut, continues to attract attention.
According to Alizh Yun, the urban brain has now shifted from a transportation management tool to a city management hub, and the associated collaboration applications have expanded to 23 cities worldwide.
New city management services functions such as camera perception, AI algorithms, city brain computing power, parking fees, real-time detection of the number of people being diagnosed, travel route design, and more can be implemented.
In the field of public services, using a cloud to connect one thing to another, to advance collaboration in office management, cloud computing has facilitated the delivery of public services at both ends.
Currently, through the administrative system, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform for the entire province.
As of September 11, this platform has covered more than 57 million residents and 15 million corporate units in the province, with data collected from governance 3066 category 190.8 billion.
The average monthly calls shared between the Zhejiang provincial government departments have reached 12 million times, and the data flows on the Zhejiang network every time, possibly meaning fewer crowds of people are doing their jobs.
Use plastic tea bags and tea bubbles!
According to the Canadian news agency, a recent study found that a plastic tea bag could release billions, or even tens of billions, of plastic particles, significantly more than the estimated amount of plastic that a person consumes for the entire year, but so far there is no evidence that consuming plastic particles poses a threat to humanity.
Researchers at Marguerite University in Canada reportedly found that, by dipping a plastic tea bag into a glass of almost boiling hot water, the tea bag would release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller naami particles into the cup.
This is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics a person consumes throughout the year.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, the average person consumes at least 50,000 plastic particles per year while absorbing the same amount of plastic.
The study, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, reportedly tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in shops and cafes, opened the tea bag, dipped the tea bags in boiling water for five minutes after cleaning, and then analyzed them using electron microscopes and spectrometers.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag releases more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, which is several degrees higher than the plastic load of previous foods.
Most tea bags are made from natural fibers, but many brands of tea bags made from natural fibers still use plastic to cover them.
Some brand tea bags no longer use paper, but instead use plastic, and these plastic tea bags are currently being tested by researchers.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic, researchers define as those particles that range in size from 100 nm to 5 centimetres, and are produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers around the world have found traces of plastic particles in the air, soil, rivers and deepest seashells, and these can also be found in fresh water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, researchers first discovered plastic particles in human feces samples from several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of tea packaging releasing plastic particles, the Canadian research team placed water into contaminated water, found that the microplastics affected the behavior of these water particles, causing them to develop developmental defects.
According to the World Health Organization, there is no evidence to date that consuming plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, WHO notes that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what impact they have on humans.
Researchers have speculated that the reason these tea bags release large amounts of plastic particles may be that these plastic tea bags may be exposed to boiling water, even when food grade plastic is heated to over 40 degrees Celsius, and may break down or release toxic substances.
Guthrie said the climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of small island nations.
There, a natural disaster will erode the developmental output of a generation.
This is evidenced by the disaster in the Bahamas, including the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, which has been hit by hurricanes since this year.
About a quarter of the population of small island developing countries live at or below 5 metres above sea level.
The relocation could seriously affect their social and lifestyle, even raising questions of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island nations have jointly committed to achieving carbon and 100% renewable energy by 2030, thus leading the world once again in the right direction.
Guthrie said: "The climate crisis is piling up new injustices on old ones".
Although small island developing countries have made little contribution to global warming, they have paid the ultimate price.
Because these countries are in a middle-income position, many countries are also in a disaster and an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of debt.
The world must act, it is time to make major decisions, and invest heavily in small island developing countries.
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for help to small island developing countries manage disaster risk, invest in climate-adjusted infrastructure and ways to transition to renewable energy; urging international institutions to help small island developing countries, especially debt-ridden middle-income countries, get funding.
Small island developing countries are at the forefront of protecting and maintaining the Earth's life cycle and oceans.
The latest special report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week confirmed that the oceans have already suffered the dire consequences of the current climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, there may be a number of extreme sea level rise events that occur in many areas every year, some of which would have occurred only a century earlier.
The report warns that if not invested heavily in adaptation, some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable.
Pollution, overfishing and oxidation have caused enormous losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while in the past 40 years, plastic pollution has increased tenfold.
Demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a shortage of resources, including the fishing grounds that sustain many island communities.
Small island nations also face high costs of transportation, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, making them subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security implications of trafficking in human beings, weapons and drugs.
Guthrie said:                                                                                                                                                                                               
The efforts of small island developing countries to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons, and examples from which to draw on the world.
He stressed that small island developing countries are a typical example of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the international community as a whole.
The Indian Ministry of Finance has said that the financial system is sufficiently liquid.
Indian Finance Minister Shita Taraman said on 26th that the current liquidity of the financial system is sufficient, driven by holiday consumption demand, and that the Indian economy is expected to recover in the second half of this financial year.
Sitharaman made the above statement after meeting with representatives of Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and others.
Sitralaman did not specify the targeting of these statements.
Previously, some Indian media and overseas media have blamed the ongoing slowdown in India's current economy on the liquidity strain of non-bank financial institutions.
Sitrahman, using the fall in car sales as an example, denies that liquidity stress is the main factor behind the fall in sales.
Sitralaman pointed out that the fall in automobile sales was mainly influenced by cyclical factors.
Sitharaman predicts that, driven by holiday consumption, India's economic growth may resume in the second half of the financial year.
India's annual shopping season, which begins in September, will last until the end of the year.
Market expectations, shopping and consumption will greatly boost India's economic growth.
The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education recently issued a notice that all provincial secondary schools are strictly prohibited from violating the supplementary education during the National Day holiday, and that organizers are randomly assigned to conduct inspections.
In the following notice on the strictly prohibited National Day of Long Vacation non-compliance, Jiangxi Provincial Ministry of Education stressed that secondary schools everywhere must be determined to do this during National Day: no longer organize student group submissions or take new classes, no longer hold classroom training, special classes, workshops, interest classes, promotion classes, etc., no longer rent campus facilities or school premises to other educational institutions for any kind of training.
At the same time, it is strictly forbidden to organize, recommend and induce students to attend extracurricular extracurricular activities, to prohibit teachers from attending extracurricular activities or from participating in extracurricular activities organized by other teachers, parents, parents' committees, and to prohibit teachers from providing relevant information to extracurricular institutions and others.
Notify clearly that for the violation of the subsidy act of the primary secondary school in Chhattisgarh, the local education administration will be given a heavy discount in the quality education development examination of the county government for the year; for the violation of the subsidy act of teachers, the district will be strictly treated in accordance with the relevant rules of the Master Teacher's Code.
 Supporting pig production  Guaranteeing market supply
 The loyalty requirement is to seize measures to implement them from six different angles.
A provincial television conference call for the promotion of pig production and market supply was held today to discuss the implementation of the central and provincial committees and the provincial governments' policy measures to support pig production and market supply and to mobilize and deploy the measures to support pig production and market supply.
 loyalty requirements, and implementation of measures to seize live pig production from six points of view.
The mayor is responsible for implementing the 45 million pigs-in-law outreach mission that was set for the entire province this year, and has been broken down into municipalities and states to include accountability.
To seize the policy measures to implement, effectively solve the policy implementation problem of the last mile.
To get the pigs that can breed, to seriously implement the subsidy policy, to encourage pig breeding businesses to expand the pig breeding scale, to systematically select good pigs from the product pigs.
To seize the opportunity to invest in the procurement, we must place the domestically well-known large-scale farming enterprises that have not yet entered our province as the focus of the procurement.
 Grab the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of pig farming cold chain logistics facilities, and fully promote the transition from pig farming to pig meat farming.
To seize the implementation of a modern epidemic control system, to equip the ground level epidemiologists in all areas to fit the scale and workload of the crop, and to establish the first line of disease control.
 loyalty requirements, full guarantee of market supply of meat products, ensure that there is no mass shortage, large-scale supply interruptions, ensure that the supply of pork on major holidays is stable.
The conference also continued to work on the ongoing efforts to control the African swine fever epidemic, to deploy the prevention of overfishing in important waters of the Yangtze River basin, and to make late acquisitions throughout the province.
The Shanghai Old Letter, which speaks of the country, the national soul, and other symbols represent the party class of university students.
My father and I were playing cards on campus to make college students happy.
As the People's Republic of China celebrates its 70th anniversary, four famous Shanghai Taipei students, representatives of the Shanghai Taipei Party, four Chinese representatives with an average history of more than 90 years, and more than 200 young scholars, spoke about the country and national soul of the Taipei brand.
A product presentation of the brand's old-fashioned brands on the site.
The classroom atmosphere is such that students exclaim, the classroom has a well-designed product display with the old-name brand, and the campus cards for me and my homeland are so fun that college students are excited.
As an old-school brand, Big White Milk Sugar has been evolving in recent years, taking action, pushing for innovation and cross-border innovation.
Born in 1959, Big White is celebrating his 60th birthday this year.
Zhuang Zhen will also focus on youth consumer groups.
The party secretary, deputy general manager, Vijayje, of the Shanghai Shanghai Wanshan Food Co., Ltd. party branch, mentioned the scenes of the springtime eating of fish, summertime fever eating of fish, autumn drinking, winter and winter, reflecting the constant innovation in people's eating habits.
The company also further explores brand culture in terms of taste innovation, comic book packaging design, and more, to adapt to the legacy of the younger generation of consumer groups.
The old numbers represent people who are speaking on the ground in the Arts Party classroom about the path of innovation.
Yu Jie, manager of Shanghai Fresh and Bone Cake Catering Ltd., also believes that,  All innovation is inseparable from a solid foundation, and that every innovation is a process of blending together.
Everyone has hidden in their hearts the expectation of the old letters.
The product-centric, small-town era should have begun.
As one of the first Chinese characters in China, Shanghai Fresh has also been able to adapt rapidly to market trends, upgrade its VI vision brand, introduce a professional operations team, and achieve a significant increase in turnover.
The old letters can be seen not only in these traditional channels such as supermarkets, but now the old letters will also actively participate in new retail and various activities.
All of our changes, in order to ultimately achieve such a goal, are to make consumers able to see, hear, and ultimately buy.
Yuyang Pyong, deputy general manager of Shanghai Corporation, Ltd., said.
In the future, Shanghai will also adhere to high-end development, broad system development prospects, user-satisfied energy-saving products, and high-tech content, high-economic benefits.
Through this Art Party class, students have reaped a lot.
The old letters have accompanied my growth, carrying beautiful childhood memories and emotions.
His classmates were appalled.
The Shanghai Tai Chi representative presented to over 200 young students the national spirit of the Tai Chi brand.
How to dig into brand culture, how to keep quality traditional culture alive and alive, is a question we as design students need to think and explore.
This party class is based on the Shanghai Video Project of Ding Wei, dean of the School of Arts and Technology at WMT, and the Integrated Brand Innovation Studio of Prof. Liu Jing, who wants to deepen the cultural potential and modern business value of the Chinese characters, to make good use of the competitiveness and influence of the Chinese characters, to enhance the cultural radiation concentration of the Chinese characters, to realize the industrial impact of the Chinese characters in the form of a design+culture, and to showcase Shanghai culture from a new perspective.

Anpe Jianzhong congratulated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China, also saying a sentence in Chinese.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe Abe Jinsun-san congratulated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on video.
Japanese Prime Minister Anbe Jinsun: Good evening, my name is Anbe Jinsun.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I would like to express my warmest congratulations on behalf of the Japanese government and people.
At the G20 summit in Osaka in June, the two countries cooperated to make the summit a success and, through the G20 leaders' Osaka Summit Declaration, declared the G20's firm resolve to the world.
In addition, at the summit and dinner before the summit, both sides agreed that President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to Japan next spring, while also agreeing to open a new era in China.
The two countries have a joint responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I am convinced that working together to address the issues facing the region and the world, and contributing to the international community, will help to build a new model for the future relationship between the two countries.
Finally, I wish the relationship between the two countries a prosperous day, and the friends' business prosper.
 Overage farming workers in some industrial areas are estimated to account for more than half of the workforce.
Where can we find young workers now?
And I don't want to use so many older people at work, there's no way.
Recently, for the phenomenon of many overage farmers working on the job, Quizhou, a longtime contractor in the construction industry, said.
Recently, the university where I live has been conducting a rain sewage treatment project, and a number of farmers have been working on campus, which if you look closely, you will find that there are many overage farmers here.
The overage farmers' workforce is not forced to work, but because they cannot afford to work, and have to work so hard, whether it's to earn money to solve their own pension and medical problems or to help their children, that these older people, who should have been born, continue to work hard.
The age of the overage farmer workers is not as easy as we thought.
Caring for children, providing for the elderly, providing for children with books, helping children build houses and buy cars, helping children start a home, and providing for the children's grandchildren, when these farmers have completed their life's work, their money bags have been emptied and even a few debts left, mostly lack of wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag their children along and to accumulate wealth, many farmers persisted in their efforts to become silent.
Many farmers of the late 1980s, early 1990s, and even later decades were reluctant to engage in harsh conditions, high-labour-intensive secondary industries or low-end services, resulting in structural waste of labor, which lacked the appeal of the job, and provided opportunities for farmers over the age of workers.
Due to a lack of skills, decreased physical and labor capacity, many overage farmers are forced to work hard, low-income, high-risk, and low-security jobs.
What can be done one day at a time, what can be done more or less is a little bit, the survival of the elderly farmers and workers behind them cannot be ignored or ignored.
Solving the problem of unpaid and unpaid wages, strengthening labour protection, reducing security risks, increasing labour income, improving the survival of overage farmers, in addition to their self-rescue, is equally essential to the institutional care and humanitarian care of the public sector.
Some scholars point out that farmers over the age of majority are unlikely to rely on home farming to solve their own pension and health problems, and they must provide for their families through other means.
Reading about the power and strength of the overage farmers' labor force helps us better understand the love and pain of the overage farmers' labor force.
Seeing the backdrop of overage farmers, hearing their sigh, thinking about how to make them return to the countryside to truly achieve their goals, needing the public sector, market and society to share responsibility in a good interaction, needing a multi-party collaboration.
Chemezov said that Russia will not export such a system for the next five years, because it will supply its army first, and then export production.
This practice is in full compliance with international custom.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure the needs of their own defense department first, and then process export orders.
Earlier, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force, General Yurizh Grehlhov, said that the development of the system was about to be completed.
The S-500 system is developed by Kimongstone-Antaizh Air and Space Defense Company.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft systems, which uses the working principle of destroying ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometres.
In addition, according to some sources, the S-500 can also destroy high-speed cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of drones, high-speed missiles faster than five times the speed of sound, and even targets located near space.
This weapon can also be integrated into a network with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defense perspective.
Sergey Chemezhov expressed particular concern about the S-400s.
He said the system is in great demand in the world at the moment, but the Russian military also needs it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 anti-aircraft system was put into service with the Arctic Air Defense Corps.
According to the news of September 15, the work on the upgrading of the S-400Zh anti-aircraft missile system has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, this is entirely part of the process of transitioning advanced defense tools in a strategic direction north.
The Russian Northern Fleet News Service reported: zh  With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controlled airspace in the Arctic region has significantly increased 
Very importantly, according to the military assessment, the system has been successfully used in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
Air Defense Corps officers have been trained for the new system and prepared for entry into combat duty.
Previously equipped with S-300 remote air defense systems, it now retains a portion of its existing facilities.
As for the air defense system, it must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, whether they are targets for high-speed flight in outer space or close to the protected facility.
According to public sources, the S-400 system, developed by Gold Diamond-An泰空防康采恩, is designed for strategic and tactical attack aircraft, ballistic missiles, high-speed ultra-sound targets and other air-to-air attack weapons.
This weapon can strike aerial-dynamic targets within a range of 400 km and hit a ballistic target that can fly at 4.8 km/s within 60 km.
Russia will never hide its intention to deploy air defense forces in the Arctic to ensure air and air security along the Northern Sea Route.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Arctic region of Russia, enough to form an anti-aircraft base, strengthening the anti-aircraft system in the Arctic.
The Russian Defense Ministry said at the time that the Arctic Troops would in future be expanded to a full brigade formation.
In addition to the newly deployed S-400 remote systems on New Zealand and the Kola Peninsula and the deployed short-range systems in the Arctic, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are capable of defending the Russian Arctic sky.
Enemy planes, helicopters and unmanned missiles will find it difficult to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government's idea, flagship stores will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
Russian merchandise companies, operating as Russian merchandise stores, specialize in selling Russian goods in China.
China's largest trading platforms such as 天猫 (Tmall) 京东 (JD)  1688  拼多多多 Pinduoduo  手Q (ShouQzh)  手Q (ShouQzh)   多功能即时通讯软件微信 (Wechat)  have their own online shops and own their own online platforms Epinduo.com and Russian commodity retail chain shops.
The Russian Export Center will work with many Russian brands to develop a marketing strategy and engagement standards for retail stores, and select virtual shelf-to-shelf products companies.
The store is scheduled to open before the end of this year and will feature products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to data from the Russian Export Center, the Chinese e-commerce platform has a total monthly traffic of up to 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, surpassing $1 billion in 2018 and beyond.
Currently, Alibaba Group will also open a pilot store selling goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore as part of its global import strategy.
According to Alexei Koseevnikov, the new store will display merchandise from companies with sales of at least 500 million rubles or more.
To be honest, my expectation of a higher sales value of 500 million rupees is still insufficient.
As we all know, Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods, considering our products to be high-quality and green environmental products.
Kosevnikov said that the competition from Chinese consumers, who are struggling to find their purchasing power, is fierce and is intensifying.
He said:  Our goal is ambitious, to launch 500 businesses through this store within three years.
At the same time, the platform will also offer products from Russian Far East companies.
Professor Vyacheslav Cheglov, professor of the Department of Trade Policy and Policy at the Russian University of Economics in Prishtina, said: "This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export hub is a state-owned, not a private institution.
I have not seen a large number of highly competitive Russian goods on the market.
He believes that the project is unlikely to be implemented in real terms, but will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to Russian News Agency, Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that product information on more than 170 Russian companies has been published on the largest international wholesale online platform Alibaba.com, which can be purchased in China or abroad.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, a training project for experts from Taobao University for Russian companies, whose first workshop was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year will also participate as a Russian enterprise in organizing industry exhibitions and commercial projects.
A large exhibition will be held in the 1000 square meter exhibition hall, where it will also be the center of business project activities, protocol signing ceremonies, presentation meetings and talks with representatives of Chinese companies.
So far, about 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The press office of the Russian Export Center said: "Outside the agricultural stand we will certainly hold business meetings, which will arrange direct contact between entrepreneurs.
This is another direction of our efforts, aiming to support and ensure that dozens of special meetings are organized for businesses.
In addition, the fair will also host a master class, a competition and a Russian American Food Review of Russian chefs who explore the Shanghai Station of Russian Food projects.

China: We are determined not to go our own way.
The answer to the 27th edition of the New Age China and World War II White Paper is: In 70 years of successful development in China, the root cause of which is the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have found the right path to the development of this Chinese characteristic socialism and have steadily followed it.
China's path to development is the choice of history, the choice of the people.
Since recent times, in an environment of increasing poverty and social unrest, a generation of good people has been searching for the path of national salvation.
However, the monarchical constitution, the restoration of the empire, the parliamentary system, the multiparty system, the presidential system have all been thought about, tried, and failed.
It was not until the Chinese Communist Party, the New China, and the Chinese people gradually opened up a Chinese-characteristic socialist path in practice.
This road that China has taken is the path of happiness for the Chinese people, the path of the Chinese people's revival, and the great path of development of China and the world.
It is because China is on the right track that it can take care of itself, become the world's second largest economy, contribute the most to global economic growth, and benefit the world continuously through its own development.
As the White Paper points out, China's development path, in line with China's national situation, adapting to the times, will increasingly show bright development prospects as the times progress.
In retrospect, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people value this right path even more.
The Chinese understand the concept of the southern nordic, understanding that adapting to others does not necessarily suit them, only their own is best.
It was with this road confidence and strategic determination that China created the miracle of the world.
In the course of the curve of human progress, the end of history has been a time of great controversy.
Today, the success of China's characteristic socialist path, proclaims the end of history, the collapse of China, the failure of socialism.
China's success, boosting the confidence of developing countries in achieving strong national wealth, expanding the path of modernisation for developing countries, has provided experience and lessons for those in the world who want to accelerate development and maintain their own independent countries and peoples, to walk the path that is in line with their own national conditions.
The world is richly colorful.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose their own path of development.
China will not import foreign models, nor export Chinese models, but will resolutely not move in its own direction, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen government-to-government exchanges with countries, and make the appropriate contribution to jointly achieve good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that the owner of a Foodworks supermarket fired a 66-year-old female worker by text message because he preferred to hire employees from Asian-American backgrounds, and the employer's practice was lashed out as shameful.
The committee said that the employer of Lady Gail Ayton, who worked at Wagga Wagga for more than 20 years, was extremely unfair in the way she treated her employees, and that it may have violated the anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Azhyton told the committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016, and he had always wanted to get rid of me, because she was not Chinese.
In this case, the vice-chairman of the committee, Peter Sams, did a search on the Internet, and found some recruitment advertisements that Mr. Wang had previously posted on various Australian Chinese employment forums.
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one said, "First elected Asian woman" and another said, "First elected Asian employee".
The third post says he prefers overseas people.
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Aytonzh in April this year by text message, later claiming that this was due to her absence and the alleged cash-strapped cash-strapped cash machine from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said that Wangzhong's reason for firing Ms. Ayton was weak, and there was no evidence.
In three years she was absent only once, missing a total of several Australian dollars.
He said, "Mrs. Ayton's dismissal has virtually nothing to do with her behavior or behavior".
He said:  In my opinion, on the basis of the evidence of Mr. Wang's recruitment advertisement, the real reason the defendant should dismiss her is that he would rather hire employees with Asian backgrounds.
Under Section 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Wang's conduct is a violation of anti-discrimination law and/or illegal for the applicant to be dismissed.
Mr Sams said that given Mr Wang's notorious treatment of Ms Ayton, he considered it inappropriate to restore her position.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Aytonzh, a temporary worker, for an hourly salary of A$26.
Given the potential violations of discrimination and labor law, Sam said he would submit his own ruling and documents to the committee's director to consider whether to transfer Mr. Wang's actions to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said that Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Azhyton any opportunity to respond to what was allegedly the reason for her dismissal.
He said:  I think that the defendant, who has taken an irreparable unfair and biased procedure to fire the applicant, Mr. Wang, awaiting this opportunity, believes that this will prove that terminating the applicant's employment is justified.
He was wrong...zh... should the defendant completely ignore any natural fair treatment when dismissing the applicant, shockingly, his rude and extremely unfair handling of the matter 
Mr. Sams said that although Foodworks is a small business, it must be frankly said that no legitimate employer will dismiss employees in the extremely unfair and perverse manner acknowledged in this case.
He said:  This is shameful, and extremely unfair.

He said that, in itself, for his representation of the accused, which drew criticism from the political opponents, his activist party was also attacked.
He stressed that he himself was not afraid of any threat, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to defame the AKP and the Hellenic government or other Hellenic leaders, so he made this decision after careful consideration.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between representing the accused and being a member of the Congress, and that there was no legal prohibition against him representing any of the accused, and that the accused, Ri Zhenghua, had not been convicted.
The six defendants were charged on 12 September this year with multiple counts of anti-trafficking in persons and anti-trafficking in immigrants under article 26E of the Act, and under article 466 of the Criminal Code, all of which were denied, and no court approval was given for their foreign trials.

Kimz-Ail, a paratrooper training ground, has a paratrooper training group of 1.83 meters tall officers, training them.
The shiny spikes, the unique olive green and bright red shoulder blades together form a bright landscape line.
A few days ago, journalists entered the squad, feeling the determination of the armed police officers to remain loyal guards of the party and people forever, and the spirit and pursuit of their supreme honour.
 Dream to shine a light on your life, write the immortal legends of a new era......  This is a song written by a group of squad officers who work together to accompany their country.
In the squad, this song is the motto of each squad member.
The 1.92 meter high Zhizhiao light, standing in the side, is exceptionally prominent.
As the flag bearer of the National Guard of the RAF, he has a deeper understanding of honor.
The honor of a soldier comes from hard training.
As the engine's flagship, Zhizhiao Light, training has always been of high standards and strict requirements.
He tied a sandbag to practice typing, carried a second watch to practice speed, blindfolded to practice width, and on top of a fancy wind trained steady.
In his career as a cartoonist, there is a picture that will always be remembered.
A flag-raising ceremony, heavy rain fell, and no one left the tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
In the moment the flag was raised, the bright light felt deeply the glory represented by this five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, Zhi Xiaopeng was selected as a paratrooper.
The standard of the flag and the standard of the flag movement of the infantry and the engineer is different.
The speed of the engineer's flagship and the ranger's march, although only 20 steps apart, requires more effort in training.
The first rank of first lieutenant was the first of the first, directly determining the order of the squadron.
After training in the paratroopers' concentration, he repeatedly exercised his legs every day, practicing his hard-legged knuckles.
In the demonstration, his precise pace, pace gained the official's standing ovation.

About 800 million people took part in the National Day of China tourism trip, which was a huge blow to China's tourism supply and demand.
About 800 million people will travel during the upcoming 11th Golden Week!
Big data from multiple travel platforms shows that China's tourism consumer market is booming in supply and demand.
The National Day of Celebration Travel Report forecasts, based on previous year's National Day of Celebration tourism statistics, that domestic tourism visits this year will be close to 800 million during the National Day holiday; in addition, there will be more than 7.5 million outbound tourist visits.
Currently, tourists from over 500 cities and towns booked group tours, free-lance tours, custom tours, local toys, and more through the platform, covering 100 countries and regions.
According to the China Tourism Research Institute, the country received a total of 726 million domestic visitors during the national holiday last year, an increase of 9.43%.
Not only will the number of visitors increase this year, but the consumption will also increase, making it the main theme of the holiday tour.
According to a report, the national holiday holiday spends more than 3,000 yuan per domestic tourist across provinces, an increase over the same period last year, due to the popularity of the tourist choice of products that are better suited to the experience, such as high-rated brand hotels, non-shopping tourist groups, elite groups, buses, etc.
Reservations data show a similar trend, with domestic long-distance travel using a comfortable model, private groups with fewer than 10 people becoming more popular than in previous years.
The data from the Spring and Autumn tourism shows that its consumers prefer heavy experience, heavy service, heavy diversification from slow moving to slow moving.
Data from the Chinese tourist bookings showed that tourist bookings in cities and towns in China have grown the fastest, reaching a 30% growth rate, which is reflected in the increase in consumption of residents in more regions of the country.
Personalization is a major feature of this year's Golden Week tour.
Carrying data shows that holiday rental car self-driving ordering is expected to grow nearly 60% compared to the national holiday holiday; short-haul self-driving travel on the surrounding minibus lines continues to be popular; private-sector subscription numbers are expected to grow by up to 155%.
Sharing joy has become the main purpose of people's leisure travel.
Carrying data shows that 28% of holiday visitors are family members, 25% are couples, 23% are friends and colleagues.
In terms of age of visitors, the  80s and 90s accounted for more than 50 percent of the total number of visitors.
It is worth noting that, in contrast to the more rapid growth in exports and exports of gold, domestic flows have seen a sharp rise this year.
According to data from the Fly Pig, the number of people booking domestic airline travel this year over the national holiday has increased by 42 percent, faster than the number of people booking outbound.
Industry analysis, while demand is rising, is pushing for tourism supply-side reforms across the country, providing visitors with a more rich tourist reception.
For example, the National Sports Administration, Ministry of Culture and Tourism jointly released the 2019 Eleventh Golden Week Sports Tourism Exceptions Line; the ongoing 2019 Shanghai Tourism Festival launched seven sub-programs: 100 cultural and tourism activities to attract Chinese and foreign tourists to participate; several provinces, including Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Shandong, will launch a free or reduced ticket price for the Zhejiang tourist area in the coming Golden Week.

The world's oldest barber died at the age of 108 years old  Haircutting took 96 years.
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest certified world record-holder, 108-year-old man who never retired from the daily barbershop, however, on 19 January, Mancinelli died of complications from cancer, ending his 96-year-old haircut.
According to CNN, Mancini immigrated to the United States at the age of eight, and soon after helped clean the floor in a barber shop, at the age of 12, began to serve guests with scissors, thus relieving the economic pressures of the home.
Mancinielli, although he was in elementary school at the time, did not graduate.
Mancini's son, Robert, revealed that his father loved his work, and that people from all over the world loved him, although he was healthy and diagnosed with cancer in February of this year, and that he was unable to work for six weeks before his death due to physical reasons, but that was not retirement, as he planned to return to his health and cut his hair.
Robert, 82, said that after his father passed away, he now had to find a new barber, because he had his father help cut his hair all his life.
In the course of the year, the company's buy-back of over $100 billion created a new record high - the China Net.
In order to stabilize the company's stock price, maintain the company's image, publicly traded companies have begun frequently buying back shares in the past two years, through targeted buybacks, collective bargaining, and so on, hoping to pass on the company's value to the market, which is underestimated, thus stabilizing the stock price, and increasing investor confidence.
According to data from Eastern FortuneChoice, the total amount of shares of publicly traded companies used to buy back shares in 2017 was 7.9 billion yuan, which rose sharply to 51 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of shares of publicly traded companies used to buy back shares has exceeded 100 billion yuan, setting a new record for the amount of shares bought back, and well above the previous year.
In terms of the purpose of the buyback, the company's buyback shares and the shareholder's increase appear to be the same, but there are significant differences in the implementation of the entity, the source of the funds, the use of the buyback, the interests of the shares themselves, etc.
Xu Zhan, chairman of Shanghai Maikyoung Information Consulting Limited, said in an interview with the journalist of the Securities Daily that the opinion issued in November 2018 on supporting the repurchase of shares of publicly traded companies, which was revised to address the problems of the existing system of narrowing the scope of share repurchase, complex decision-making procedures, unsound inventory system, and increased sharply in the same year as the policy-making process began to encourage the repurchase of shares of publicly traded companies.
In January this year, the exchange formally released the rules for the repurchase of shares of publicly traded companies, which expanded the sources of the company's capital, simplified the implementation process, guided the improvement of governance arrangements, encouraged the implementation of incentives or employee stockholding schemes.
 After the opinion was issued, the actions of the listed companies to buy back shares, have more appropriate circumstances, the buyback process is simpler, and the share buyback motivation is also greater
Purchase of shares at a relatively low position also benefits the efficiency of the publicly traded companies in using their funds, thus increasing the level of earnings per share, increasing the net asset yield, reducing the pressure on the company's earnings indicator.
Compared to the increase in large shareholders, the return on equity of publicly traded companies is more meaningful, as well as reflecting the active willingness of publicly traded companies to manage market value and cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the undervalued stock price is the main factor in the buy-back of listed companies, that the company's stock price is no longer able to reflect the company's future development prospects, so these companies deserve investor attention, but cannot invest blindly, need to pay attention to the profitability of such listed companies and the specific operating situation.
Publicly traded companies with large-scale buybacks at least show confidence in the company's growth and financial strength.
The buyout enthusiasm of publicly traded companies has gradually warmed up, and the buyout behavior has become more normalized, with data showing that nearly a thousand publicly traded companies have already made stock buyouts this year, and leading companies in various industries have become a dominant force in the buyout market.
China平安 recently disclosed the progress of the buyback, saying that the company has accumulated a total of 5.75 million shares of shares through a centralised tendering transaction, representing 0.315% of the company's total share capital,  total amount of funds paid for a total of 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction fees) zh, the buyback of shares will be entirely for the employee stock holding plan, including but not limited to the long-term service plan approved by the company's general meeting of shareholders that has been considered zh.
Eli's shares have paid 57.92 billion yuan for share buyback and for the recent adjustment of the use of share buyback, from the original plan to use all of the shares as a stock source for the subsequent implementation of the share incentive to the cumulative repurchase of 1.83.3 million shares, of which 1.52 million shares were used for the implementation of the share incentive, the remaining 30.49 million shares will be used for bankruptcy to reduce registered capital.
Eli shares said that the divestment of some of the shares that had been bought back would further improve the level of earnings per share, and actually increase the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group issued a progress announcement on the takeover on September 25, showing that TCL Group has cumulatively taken back 3.59% of the company's shares, for a total cost of US$16.5 billion.
The TCL Group's board of directors' office told the Zheng Zhe newspaper that the repurchase of shares will be used for employee stock holding plans, stock incentives or for convertible corporate bonds issued by publicly traded companies.
TCL Group adheres to its established operating strategy, continuously improving competitiveness, sustainable healthy development and growth.
Based on confidence in the company's future development and the maintenance of investor interests, combined with the performance of the company's stock in the secondary market in the past year, and taking into account factors such as the company's operating and financial situation, the company plans to buy back the company's shares using its own funds, self-funding and other financing methods.
Dr. Dillon, chief economist of the Forefront Open Source Fund, said that the operation of a publicly traded company to buy back shares, on the one hand, can reduce the number of shares circulating on the market, increase the earnings per share of a publicly traded company, is an important advantage for secondary market shares; furthermore, the willingness of publicly traded companies to actively extract real silver, to buy back shares from the stock market, and to cancel shares, greatly boosted market confidence.
The gradual increase in the recall of domestic listed companies in recent years, particularly performance stocks, is a very good way to boost investor confidence through stock recalls, and is a practice that deserves confirmation and encouragement.
The Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Commission, the Secretary of the Hangzhou Municipal Commission, Huang Hua and the Four Great Commands of the Engineering Machinery Manufacturing Force, have set a small goal around Hangzhou, from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing, to build a world-class engineering machinery industry cluster in five years.
The world's leading engineering and mechanical engineering industry group in Yangtze, in terms of current times, is the strongest geospatial construction company in the world.
As a city of the Inland Provincial Council, the Yangsha shouts this grandiose, "What's the bottom line?"
 is based on the force of the gas side leakage.
The four engineering machinery companies that participated in the dialogue, each with their own hands, covered all areas of the sky, underground, at sea and on land: light aircraft with mountain intelligence, concrete transportation for heavy duty, three heavy duty all-terrain trucks, railroad construction shields, its hard power, the so-called "unique underground", and the arrogant group of men.
China had virtually no say in the manufacture of engineering machinery.
When Chinese companies moved in, they moved in, moved out, moved out, took advantage of the two-wheeler, took advantage of the east winds of the Zhongshan Road Initiative, acquired, merged, planted, and so on, and became a global engineering machinery industry.
Among them, the three main economic indicators, such as heavy industry, heavy industry, heavy construction, iron and steel, engineering machinery and engineering, such as Mountain River Intelligent, have significantly outperformed similar enterprises.
The camera moves the weather.
                                                                                                  
Among the global industrial lake of Jiangzh, whoever lives and lives well is the hard-liner of speech.
In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry experienced a cold winter, and many internationally renowned engineering machinery manufacturing companies fell, but the engineering machinery manufacturing companies of Yangsha-shi saw the past as a winter swimming experience, self-stressed, self-disrupted, transformed through industrial structure, from manufacturing to artificial intelligence, not only moving forward, but also strengthening the bones of the body.
It is based on the power and influence of the star-studded enterprise.
Developing a strong industry requires both the active involvement of businesses and the active role of the government.
Changsha has the reputation of being the engineering machinery capital, having brought together an entire industry chain from upstream to downstream, having formed many related industry clusters, and having largely reduced the cost of R&D, manufacturing and sales by optimizing the business environment, improving support services, simplifying the approval process, and so on.
A good business environment, allowing engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises to come to the fore.
History has pushed Yangsha to the forefront of building the world's leading level of engineering machinery, and it's time to wait, not to let go.
Governments, businesses, and even related industries should seize opportunities, as well as set goals, sustain efforts, contribute to building a strong manufacturing power and the power of Hunan.

Currently, Africa faces a threat of terrorism and extremism, and only solving security issues can truly achieve long-term peaceful development in Africa.
 Look forward to further coordinating positions with China in the Security Council, strengthening cooperation and cooperation in solidarity

GANGCINGYANG: The lake is coming to the poverty line.
The fall of September was the fall of the Yellowstone Plateau.
In the local farming cooperative, 58-year-old Shavli, a village man, filled the last straw in the sheepfold, watched the pitch, watching a mouthful of white lambs.
Enjoy the food, wait until the winter season is full, and go out to sell for good money.
Shavely said he gave her a daily diet of special foods, regular hygiene cleaning, disinfecting, and careful serving.
Shaverley had been raising sheep for over 20 years, until the cooperative was able to realize how roughly shepherding was done in the past.
Shaveli is a village in the Zhongqing District of Guangzhou province.
His left-neighborhood and right-neighborhood are all herders, but stick to traditional breeding practices, poor quality sheep, and small production.
In June of this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Shavely spent the whole day digging and farming, because he always had a thing in his heart.
The shareholders are mostly poor people, they all give the sheep to cooperatives, they can't split up at the end of the year, they sell at a higher price, but they all look to him.
Under the guidance of a technical staff, he gradually learned to fight the plague, mastered scientific nutrition, and became the village's only small-scale farmer.
The Professional Cooperative for Civil Agriculture is a standardized cooperative, with a total of 16 sheep barns, and nearly 1,400 sheep.
According to the head of the cooperative, the standardised sheep shed has a very wide range of doors.
 Wool is thick, easily breed, sheep should not be kept in hot, humid places, sheepskin should be built in three-dimensional areas, and a ventilator should be installed to ventilate heat.
 Say, for the prevention of the plague, it is also necessary to regularly disinfect the sheep shed with spray, and to give the sheep three to four times a quarter a day a vaccine.
 Small fat sheep in addition to living well, can also be eaten with grass made from a mixture of brown corn, wheatgrass, etc., and have a wide enough playground to relax muscles
The cooperative adopted a management approach, guided local farmers to bring good sheep to the area, unified the breeding, management, sales, achieved good breeding, scientific, standardized, concentrated farming.
Today, 140 poor families with sheep shares, divided by more than 6,000 yuan per household annually, have four registered poverty alleviation entities working in cooperatives.
From the hill grazing to the precision grazing, from the local mating to the artificial insemination, from the body-forming to the belly-skin to the one-to-one Bzh over the...... In Gankongyang, the meat and sheep farming has not only changed the way of grazing, but the pattern of the corporate+ cooperative+ farmer's movement has also changed the landscape of the former hill country, the market for sheep, overcoming the poor and fragmented days of traditional farming, as modern sheep farming has become more modern.
 said, if the market price is weak, local flagship company Ganjong Tsingzhong Ranch Development Ltd. will acquire the acquisition at a market-protective price of 27 yuan per kilogram, helping farmers to diversify market risk.
Xu Zhiengfeng, general counsel of Ganshan Tsingsan Agricultural Development Limited, said that by providing loans to poor households, providing sheep supply, order breeding, bidding, and unified processing sales, businesses are driving more and more poor households.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor households achieved steady growth through the cultivation of weeds, good breeding, large-scale farming, slaughter division, market sales, and the sale of the land.
The northern agricultural crossroads of Qingyang City are rich in grass resources.
Currently, there are 913 large-scale sheep farms, cooperatives, more than five million sheep farms, and two processing production lines for the slaughter of 1.3 million sheep, and the sheep are becoming the leading industry in the region.
The French finance minister said he would cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros next year and called on Germany to follow suit.
French Finance Minister Bruno Lezh Maire said on Thursday that France will reduce taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive a sluggish economy.
LeMel, while presenting France's 2020 budget, said that the latest monetary easing initiative by the European Central Bank has created an opportunity for the governments of the Member States with the capacity to afford it to increase investment.
The European Central Bank lowered interest rates to record low levels on September 12 and plans to restart debt to reduce borrowing costs, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and boost inflation.
Low interest rates will not bring Europe back to prosperity, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, Lezmell told reporters.
Germany needs to invest, it needs to do so now, the sooner the better.Don't wait until the situation gets worse and you can act again.
He has repeatedly made this appeal to Germany.
France has already implemented tax cuts of more than 10 billion euros this year, bringing a major boost to France's economic growth.
The global economy is losing momentum, and Germany's export-dependent economy is the first to suffer.
Lemel pointed out that next year the tax burden on French households will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros, including 5 billion euros of income tax relief.
Furthermore, as the corporate tax rate is gradually implemented over five years from 33.3% to 25%, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost 1 billion euros.

Research: The National Health Diets Index of the United States has seen a small increase, but it is still challenging.
According to reports by the American Journal of Nutrition, a recent study in the United States showed that over the past 16 years, the U.S. government's healthy eating index has seen moderate growth, rising from 56 to 58.
But with a score of 100 points, it's not worth celebrating.
Americans still face significant challenges in dieting.
Dr. Zhang Zhanfang, a nutritionist at Tufts University, Massachusetts, who was one of the authors of the study, said Americans still consume too much food that can cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and other conditions, all of which are among the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published on 24 July in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study was based on the U.S. government's health survey of 440,000 adults from 1999 to 2016.
The authors write,   Despite the dramatic improvement, significant dietary challenges remain. 
These challenges include reducing the consumption of snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter, and other fatty foods.
Research has found that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5% to 12% in the daily diet, exceeding the recommended 10% intake limit.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet was that sugar intake was reduced from 16% to about 14%, but the intake was still too high.
Officially, it is believed that in the daily diet, the intake of added sugar should be less than 10%.
 The reason for the reduced sugar intake is thought by researchers to be related to the reduction in the consumption of sweet water, but Zhang芳 emphasizes that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and tomatoes.
U.S. adults have slightly increased intake of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain foods.
However, data from 2016 shows that these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Although people have reduced their intake of salt slightly, and the reduction in juice has led to the consumption of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang芳 said they still account for up to 42% of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
This study was based on a biannual personal health survey, which enables adults to recall the food they ate in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have been conducted twice every few days since 2003 to ask this question.
The government-issued Dietary Guidelines for U.S. Residents recommend that people adopt a healthy diet to reduce their risk of developing chronic diseases.
The guidelines point out that people should consume more nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meat, poultry, egg, and seed foods that can provide protein.
During the study, the number of people with diabetes among the U.S. population nearly doubled, to more than 7 percent, and the obesity rate has increased over the years of the study.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among Americans.
The EU is promoting strategic partnerships with Asia.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, the secretary of the Central Secretariat, the Central Economic Ministry, the Zheng Wenping Rate Committee, attended the forum.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and individual partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the forum focuses on the theme of achieving a link between the EU and Asia: building bridges for a sustainable future.
The forum was held a year after the implementation of the EU's strategy of integration on both continents.

Earlier this year, JINGDONG Digital Technology introduced a new technology system, using technology and digitalization to improve product R&D and wind control capabilities of the technology.
The new system will take advantage of the ability to design products, sell transactions, manage assets, assess risks, and improve the overall level of intelligent operations in the investment management industry.
 Experts believe that while asset management technology improves customer service capabilities, innovative products, it can also improve risk prevention capabilities, improve asset management efficiency and improve the efficiency of the company.
Zhang阳 said that in the past, the risk preferences of customers to target customers through questionnaires were easily biased, while now using AI to create user images, helps to better target customers, introduces products according to customer investment preferences, and helps to solve risk.
Other big data such as e-commerce, time and space data can help us better map a region, an industry's activity, geography.
Zhang Zhangyang said that while decomposing the risk, big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities.
The record for the deepest railway in China has been updated.
On September 27, after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the construction of the high-altitude railway line 1井 was completed on September 27, well depth reaching 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the Chinese railway's deepest record, which was largely created in flood conditions.
The 34.5 km long Daeray Railway's longest single-line tunnel in Asia, the Longest single-hole tunnel in the whole of the region, is located in Yunnan, on the west bank of the Yangtze River, across the Daeray Mountains.
The tunnel crosses 19 fault lines, buried at a maximum depth of 1155 meters, and because it covers almost all the potential geological and major risks that can be encountered in the construction of the tunnel, the Goryeong Mountain Tunnel is known as the Tunnel Construction Geological Museum.
The well is the most important auxiliary pit on the Goryeongong Mountain Route, carrying on the important task of increasing the work area to achieve long-term and later railway operations.
The well was successfully dug to the bottom, marking the official entry of the Highlands Tunnel into the construction of a horizontal tunnel, waiting for the well's bottom parking lot to be dug and replaced, the well could add four working surfaces, accelerate the opening of the well's right opening.
The wells are all in the granite floor, and because the granite floor has a relatively large crack, the water cannot stop, the water can flow continuously from above to below, basically the well has the depth of the water pressure.
Director General of the Railway Project Department of the Central Railway Agency, Daryzh told reporters that during the construction of the well, several times there were mudslides, collapses, and other hazards, the builder invited experts to the field, and the project was discussed 20 times.
When the water flows into the well is at its highest, it reaches more than 300 cubic meters per hour, well depths of more than 700 meters, and water pressure is equivalent to the depth of 700 meters.
If we don't draw the wastewater in time, we'll drown 10 meters in one hour, we spend almost 85% of our time treating water, 15% of our time digging.
To overcome geological problems such as the development of wells along the slope of the development, mudflowing water, rich water rocks, and other geological problems, the construction of the tunnels uses combined systemic water management measures, reducing construction risk.
After several improvements, the construction of 1 well formed mechanized flow water lines such as excavation systems, excavation systems, suspension systems, vehicle lifting systems, achieved the mechanized operation of all processes such as explosion, explosion, excavation, mold installation, concrete construction, accelerated construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, 井 successfully completed the excavation of 762.59 meters of depth.
The 330-kilometer long Great Lakes Railway, which forms an important part of the China-Myanmar International Highway, is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the construction of the Belt and Road.
After the tunnel is completed, the journey time from Dali to Raili will be reduced from the current 6 hours of the highway to 2 hours, greatly improving the transportation pattern in the Western region, and promoting the friendly economic and trade cooperation between China and Southeast Asian countries.

The keys to the British tourist car fell into the lake and the whole family was trapped in France for five days.
Recently, a couple in England and Wales took their two children to France for a vacation, and as a result of accidentally dropping their car keys into the lake, the whole family was forced to wait five days before getting the new car key from the car manufacturer.
The couple then left France with their children.
On September 16, local time, the British family reportedly was on a lake tour in France when their daughter unwittingly flipped a briefcase and dropped the car key inside into the lake.
But they spent several hours, and could not find the key.
All their belongings and cash were locked in the car.
Although British tourists bought insurance before departure, the insurance company refused to help out on the grounds that the vehicle was not stolen.
They would have hired a tow truck, dragged it to a repair shop, and then re-ordered the key from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally got the key to the recipe, and it was only the couple who left France with their children.
The trip they had planned was cancelled due to the loss of the car keys.

In the areas of low-risk food production permits, such as pilot projects, the PZH will notify the commitment system, delegate the powers of the foreign company delegation to the FTA.
On 27th, the Shanghai City Market Regulatory Authority and the Pudong New District government signed a memorandum of understanding, introducing 20 market regulatory reform measures, some of which are among the leading pilot measures in the country.
A notice commitment is defined as a written statement of the terms and conditions of the law and regulations and a requirement that the administrative body, when handling the relevant licensing registration process, inform the applicant once and for all.
zh After the applicant signs the pledge, the administrative body can directly provide it.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority will support the pilot notification commitment system in the three areas of Pudong New District and Shanghai Free Trade Trial Zone, namely, business name registration, simple process handling, low-risk food production permits, partial measuring instrument type approval, to facilitate business access.
Shanghai Shenzhen Food Co., Ltd. on 27th of January, obtained a food production license on the spot by promising to notify, becoming the first company to enjoy pilot dividends.
The head of the company said that food permits can also be certified on the spot, and that the company has also adopted a non-acceptance procedure, which allows companies to submit part of the material within the deadline set out in the notice letter of commitment, and that the reform has actually made it easier for them to do so.
The Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority said that the commitment to notify the implementation of food production permits is a nationwide pioneer pilot.
After the reform, the approval phase was reduced from the previous registration, acceptance, on-the-spot checks, sampling checks, material audits, approval certificates, compressed into six sections, to three sections, with the completion time from the previous 20 working days, shortened to the present completion.
Given the high volatility of the economy in Pudong, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority has transferred the registration of foreign companies' permanent representative offices to the Shanghai Free Trade Area, facilitating close access for companies.
Statistics show that the waiver of this right involves a total of 1592 houses of the Permanent Representation of the Republic of China to the Shanghai Free Trade Area, 99 of which have been treated in accordance with the new rules.
Long-term consumption small survey: more diverse choices  tourism takes the top spot 
With the National Day holiday approaching, people's holiday plans are also gradually being finalized.
A reporter recently launched a small investigation into the 11th anniversary of the holiday in a circle of friends, and the nearly 20 comments received show that while everyone's plans vary, travel+consumption has become the key word for the 11th anniversary.
Specifically, in the feedback received by journalists from the Zhengqi Securities Daily, over half of the people chose tourism.
Mr. Zheng, who lives in Tianjin, said that during the period of planning to take his family to Shanghai to play, Disney was the first stop, then to the surrounding cities for a turn; Ms. Li, from Beijing, chose to travel to Taiwan, a family of three, set out on September 28, planning a 10-day trip to Zhongshan Island, a destination in New York; Mr. Zhang, from Hebei, chose to travel by car, he said, with his daughter under two years old, going out of the remote door, planning to drive to Shandong, playing at sea for a few days.
A recent joint report on travel and travel trends for residents of the 2019 National Day of Hong Kong Golden Week, released by Dong Dong and Dong Tourism, shows that the consumer upward trend in travel and travel for this year's National Day of Hong Kong Golden Week is evident in the three segments of travel, housing and travel.
The permeability of airplanes, high-speed rail travel has steadily increased, the demand for personalized non-standard accommodation has increased.
The 2019 National Tourism Consumer Trends Report released by the American Tourism Association on September 23 shows that tourism consumption continues to grow, and that there is a diversified upward trend in the housing market.
More young people are traveling to China, with high quality, unique experiences, cultural tourism, nightlife, etc. The heat continues to be high.
In addition to tourism, various consumer demands were also concentrated during the 11th century.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the Securities Daily News that the main plan for this year's eleventh year was to buy a car.
The staff of a Beijing-based car brand 4S told the Zhengqian Securities Daily that, in general, September or October of each year is known as the golden period of car sales.
During the 11th, shops will launch a number of activities, such as sweepstakes, to shop closures, etc.
In addition, many brands have recently introduced new models, and the new products are expected to have a more noticeable effect on sales.
With the trend of consumer upgrading, people place more emphasis on meeting spiritual needs, culture, education and the continuous increase in the share of services consumed.
Ms. Duzh, who lives in Beijing, said, "Since the birth of a child, cultural, educational spending has become the main source of household spending".
This year's 11th year has been filled with enthusiasts, touring the Kazhong Astronomy Museum, the Children's Theatre, about a couple of family weekends camping in the Rago Museum, and arranging for some rehearsal experiences.
Some industry experts say that theoretically, residents' consumption upgrades evolved by the evolution of survival-type consumption into developmental consumption and enjoyment-type consumption, where a substantial portion of enjoyment-type consumption falls within the category of service-type consumption.
With the continuous development of our economic society and the rising income level of residents, people are increasingly focusing on spiritual consumption needs, tourism, travel and travel is a great way to get around.
Especially catching up with the 11th National Day holiday, more time, more willingness to travel and spend, which both meets the spiritual demands of consumption and is a manifestation of the upgrading of consumer consumption in the population.
The afternoon started to feel lonely, unwilling to go out, and unable to adjust to the absence of children.
He nodded, and told the dog, Nana, "Take you out".
A detailed list of things to do outside the house, characteristics of A-type blood are getting stronger, and they all feel very different.
Take out clothes, buy nutrition, pay, buy live fish, snack from Nanazh.
That is the reason for leaving.
On the phone, I had just finished preaching to my sister Nana, who had already been given the opportunity to buy snacks.
The other side laughed a few times, saying the kids would come and call and hung up.
Nana jumped on the assistant's chair, the old man actually got off the ground, she knew she was driving, panicked, nervous, and reluctant to go with me.
Her husband Booz is hardly home early.
He even admired the delicious salad made with fish and beef, then went to the bedroom and lay on the bed watching TV.
Look at the wall, it's just 7:00, the sun rises and sets early, the sun is already dark.
The whole circle of friends is in the invention moon, and today is actually mid-autumn.
Wash a bunch of grapes from friends, leave half for Bojo, and put the rest in his favorite little flower bowl, then go out to see the moon.
And Na'na sat on the ground, and I ate the grapes, and she ate the skin, and I spat the grapes with the power of the wind far away.
The moon is hidden in the clouds, as if it were passing through the clouds, the moon suddenly disappears, the bright and dark is somewhat sharp.
His mind was filled with various poems about the moon, and he liked the phrase: every time three or five people gathered together, he would only give a round of the day to look at the sun.
Perhaps we have given too much emotion to the color of the moon, but for my current theory, in fact, the saying "God to God, Caesar to Caesar" is the best.
The color of the moon is the color of the moon, the emotion is your own.
After eating grapes, this group of cold months is frozen.
The Nanas had a tiny voice at their feet, stood up, spread Nana's blanket over her little house, and Nana happily lay on it.
Lazh opened the door and shouted: "Is the water in the bathroom hot enough?
From the bathroom window, there is no moonlight, only the moonlight, the bathroom light is turned off, the glass is pulled open.
He did not eat any cake, nor did he drink any liquor.

Military  Machine Dogs  First performance class  Solar Theater: considering inclusion in the show lineup 
The U.S. military is investing in research and development for battlefield machine dogs, and now they may be getting on the circus stage!
The Sun Circus announced yesterday that it is in talks with Boston Dynamics, a robotics company that is developing robots, to discuss the feasibility of using robots for circus performances.
Boston Power Technology Company, Inc. released a promotional video of the four-legged robot Spot on the 24th, showing Spot as a agile mobile robot, capable of carrying 14 kilograms, with highly adaptable mobility to cross-country terrain, 360-degree avoidance, navigation, remote control and autonomy.
Specifically, Spot has an exclusive software platform developed exclusively for Spot, where users can customize the functionality of Spot robots through various applications.
The concept of a machine dog was first published in 1992 by Boston Power Technology, a company that caused a sensation at the time, but has yet to really enter commercial application.
However, Boston Power Technology Company notes that Spot has entered the mass production phase, with customers mainly in the construction, energy and construction industries.
In addition, the SunCircus is currently in the process of joining forces with Boston Power Technology, a company that is still in the planning stages, and is evaluating the potential of using Spot to perform live.

Is Mawar running for the Dhanbi Aish Assembly seat in Juwar?
Chairman of the General Assembly of Mawar, Natukshuri Kishizhiang:    The discussion of the Supreme Council of the State Duma! 
The upcoming elections will see whether the Mawar of the Nationalist Party will contest this traditional state seat.
However, after a meeting of the Central Committee of the Maharashtra Party, it was announced that the Supreme Council of the National Party would be entrusted to decide whether to continue to hand over the traditional Maharashtra parliamentary seat or to hand over the party's alternate members to other members.
After presiding over the meeting of the Maharashtra Central Committee on Thursday afternoon, he told the media that any by-election would be conducted according to the standard operating procedure (SOP) and would be decided after the meeting of the Maharashtra's Supreme Council.
He said that since the Election Commission will only meet on Monday to finalize the matter of the Dzhongbi State Assembly, the meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front is expected to be convened in early October.
Yesterday morning, I also met with Nationalist Party Chairman Natukshri Aramatzashi, we all agreed that we must reclaim this parliamentary seat from the hands of the hopeful coalition.
 We have decided to convene a special meeting of the National Front leaders in early October, where the National Front Three Party Party will determine which member party will be in the line of duty.
Asked whether the Maharashtra would hold on to this traditional parliamentary seat in the National Front's Supreme Council, Xiangxiang reiterated that as the Chairman of the National Front, he must act according to standard operating procedures, so any decision must be made by consensus of the National Front.
 In any by-election, if someone is willing to stand, if there is a political party, if in some way they feel they should stand, this is common practice.
 Most importantly, from which organization and political alliance do we come?zh
This is a great test for us who have been a political alliance for many years, we believe the National Front will come a long way, holding on to some precious values.
 In the process, someone might say something, which is strange.
 However, once the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has decided, everyone must be fully prepared for war, which is the most precious thing.
In any case, Xiangxiang said, Mawar will be preparing for the upcoming Danbi Ai state by-election at three levels, namely district council, state assembly and central, with all possible efforts.
The District Council is headed by the District Council President Nadu Sri Huang, while the State Joint Commission is headed by the Chairman of the Joint Commission of the Juzhou State, Nadu Rinpei Xing, while the Central Committee is headed by the Chairman of the Joint Commission, Nadu Mahanshu, and the General Secretary, Nadu Zhangshengchu.

A village in the northern part of the province of Hubei has been ordered to hunting wildlife.
A village in the northern part of the province of Hubei was sentenced for hunting wildlife, and ordered to pay environmental damage to the ecosystem for repairs.
Due to the family poverty of the accused, the prosecutor's office enabled alternative labour compensation ecological repair costs, achieving a mechanical integration of legal effect and social effect.
According to Wang Zhonglianzh, Deputy Attorney General of the Parkong County Prosecutor's Office, through three months of forced labor, including forced labor, the defendant has developed a deep affinity for wildlife and a deep sense of guilt over previous hunting behavior.
On June 21 of this year, a civil civil interest criminal litigation involving environmental resources was filed by the Park Chung County Prosecutor's Office, which was openly tried in the county court and sentenced to death.
The accused was sentenced to three years in prison, four years of probation, and a fine of 3,000 yuan, while ordering him to pay environmental damage to the ecological resources of 154,20 yuan.
Chang, Zhou Myozh started installing power grids at the cliffs in late January 2014, hunting more than 20 wildlife, including zebras, small lizards, and crown deer.
The zebra is a National Wildlife Refuge, Class II, and the small, bald reindeer is listed on the National Wildlife Refuge List.
During the trial, Zhou Yi-mu has openly confessed to his wrongdoing and wrongdoing and is willing to assume the accompanying civil liability.
But given the poor economic situation in Zhou Yue, the local village committee, forest station, and Zhou Yue trio, in coordination with the Parkong County Prosecutor's Office, reached an agreement on alternative labor compensation ecological repair costs: providing public utility labor compensation for ecological repair costs by conducting maintenance work in the Zhou Yue conservation area, mandatory hiking, forest protection for a year, and providing for the conservation of the ecological repair costs in the Zhou Yue reserve.
 On the recommendation of the prosecutor, the court agreed, agreed to the suspension of the enforcement of the suspension, and actively fulfilled the obligation to pay the ecological repair costs of alternative labour compensation
Currently, Zhou Yi has been in the reserve for 3 months, performing duty duty work, and is active in the mountains.
In recent years, the Parkongzh County Prosecutor's Office has in practice incorporated the function of prosecuting and the conduct of social governance into an organic mix, scientifically applied methods of prosecuting recommendations, surveillance of detection, and litigation supervision, to minimize the environmental damage caused by criminal conduct through judicial means.
The United Nations has awarded the Earthwatchers Award for Forestry.
Amidst a warm applause and a revived musical sound, Xu Deete, the head of the  Forest project, and user representative ShenLang, took the podium, receiving the 2019 United Nations Earth Watch Awards trophy from the host.
The 2019 Earth Watch Awards ceremony was held in New York, USA, where the Forest Awards program, which uses mobile phones to engage hundreds of millions of people in environmental protection efforts, was awarded the incentive and action awards.
A week ago, the UN Environment Programme had already announced the list of winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but the people attending the awards ceremony that day were still very excited.
In an interview with Xinhua, UN Environment Programme Executive Director Ingu Anzhong said that forestry is an exciting innovation that moves hundreds of millions of people to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans can do for the environment.
It will use technology to connect people and the environment, allowing each individual to participate in the action to protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.
Launched in August 2016 on the payment platform, 森林 by Chinazh Financial Services Group (WEB users accumulate green energy by recording their green journeys in daily life in 森林, paying for water and electricity online, and other low-carbon activities.
For every user who cultivates a virtual tree, forestry and partners will plant a real tree in desertified areas.
As of August this year, 500 million forest users had cumulative carbon reduction of 7.92 million, while planting 1222 million trees in desertified areas.
Among the Earth Guards Awards presented that day, Costa Rica's National Environmental Award winner, the award-winning Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado praised the contributions of the forest, which has been able to inspire so many people to participate in the green movement, and is impressive.
Golden Cloth Chairman and CEO 井zhong said, The Earthwatchman Award is a confirmation of the Forest project.
Technology and an open platform that makes it possible for people to participate in low-carbon living, an honor that belongs to all participants.
井 said that in the past three years, forestry has affected 500 million people, and the goal of forestry in the next three years is to involve one billion people worldwide in low-carbon actions.
While fighting desertification, protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' income more from the green water of the mountains.
Besides providing employment opportunities through tree planting, it also hopes to help farmers achieve increased yields through agricultural product development projects, e-commerce platforms, and more.
The public-benefit environmental protection model based on digital technology created by the forestry industry has also been successfully launched, drawing on other countries.
In June this year, the Philippines' largest e-wallet, GCash, launched its Philippine version of Forestry, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through a low-carbon life.
GCash, in collaboration with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Public Interest Organization and others, plans to plant 36,50,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of the project's launch.
The Earthwatchers Award is the highest award of the United Nations in the field of environmental protection, awarded annually.
 Forest won the award, which was the third consecutive year that a green innovation project from China, after the Chinese Sehanzh Forest Builder, the Chinese Zhejiang Province's 千村 demonstration, the Wang Village Repair Project, received the  incentive and action award among them.
Economic and trade friction has affected the U.S. economy.
The U.S. economy's second-quarter performance chart for this year shows that, influenced by a sharp decline in private-sector investment and exports, the U.S. GDP growth rate slows significantly over the previous quarter.
Analysts note that the economic and trade friction and the resulting uncertainty were the main factors that led to the second quarter's decline in private sector investment and exports.
The final adjustment data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on 26th February shows that the second quarter of the U.S. GDP grew at a compound annual growth rate of 2%, which is consistent with the adjustment data released earlier, but significantly lower than the first quarter's 3.1%.
According to data, consumption growth has become a major contributor to U.S. economic growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption spending, which accounts for about 70% of the total U.S. economy, grew at a quarterly rate of 4.6%, driving economic growth of 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government spending and investment have driven economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter declined 6.3% from the previous quarter, dragging the growth of the quarter by 1.16 percentage points; exports declined 5.7% from the previous quarter, net exports dragged the growth of the quarter by 0.68 percentage points.
Bari Knap, managing partner of the US-based Ainside Macroeconomic Consulting Company, said private sector investment not only failed to maintain the growth momentum of last year, but also fell sharply, as economic and trade friction and rising uncertainty hit business confidence.
Knap believes that, under the influence of policy uncertainty, U.S. corporate capital expenditures are expected to remain in a downward trend next year.
Analysts believe that while consumption growth has provided strong support to the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are increasing signs that economic and trade friction and the associated uncertainty have already affected consumer confidence and are adversely affecting the U.S. consumer outlook.
Richard Curtin, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, who led the survey, said a recent survey showed that 38 percent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a new six-month high.
Regarding the future US economic trend, analysts generally believe the US economy will continue to slow.
But experts also say that if the economic and trade friction is eased, the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Global economist Karen Birch of the British Economist's think tank predicts that the U.S. economy will continue the slowdown trend since this year, with growth slower than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts that, assuming the economic and trade tensions no longer continue to escalate, the U.S. economy will grow by 2.3 percent this year and further slow down to 1.6 percent next year.
Ellen Harz, investment manager at Patnans Investment Company, noted that the current concern of the company is the uncertainty surrounding the trade dispute and its consequences; if the trade dispute is resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced, and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than it is now.
Matt Meely, a stock strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that economic friction remains a top issue, and that it is the main cause of the sharp fluctuations in the U.S. capital markets this year, and that if the economic and trade friction is properly resolved, it will be key to affecting the U.S. capital market trend for the remainder of the year.
The parents of the first couple of parents and their children aged 0 to 3 years can take 10 days off per year.
Safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and is an important sign of progress in social civilization.
On September 27, at the fifteenth meeting of the 12th Plenary Session of the Standing Committee of the People's Assembly of the People's Autonomous Region of Ningxia, the Women's Rights and Rights Regulations of the People's Autonomous Region of Ningxia were adopted by a large majority.
This is the comprehensive system of local sex regulations promulgated by the provincial legislature of Ningxia's premier ministry to protect women's legitimate rights and interests, which will be officially implemented from November 1, 2019.
The regulations adopted today, which were revised in accordance with the provisions of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Women of the People's Republic of China, implemented in 2007 in the People's Republic of China, are divided into articles 9 and 65, including general rights, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labour and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marriage family rights, legal responsibility, and annexes.
In its regulations, Ningxia encouraged exploration of the practice of couples' joint parental leave, which is still the first in the country.
In April this year, the State Council Office issued guidelines for promoting the development of childcare services for children under the age of three with a relevant description for spousal co-parenting.
In the course of the revision of the Ninja Regulations, innovation was proposed to encourage the employee unit to provide joint parental leave to spouses who have children in accordance with the laws and regulations, every ten days of the year between the ages of 0 and 3 years of the children.
At the same time, the   regulation highlights the anti-sexual harassment and protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulation incorporates the latest legislative achievements in China's current Civil Code on Human Rights, and provides for detailed provisions on the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subject and mechanism of anti-sexual harassment, and so on.
Article 44 of the Constitution, which prohibits the repeated sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, prevention and prevention work, becomes the new standard for protecting girls in local legislation.
Article 35 of the right of women to know and to deal with the common property of the married family, Article 35 of the Law, which specifically provides for the right of women to know and to deal with the common property and the obligations of the property registration body and its relevant entities, provides a solid institutional support for women's rights.
In addition, the social hotspots of Article 26 of the Employment and Workplace Gender Discrimination Act not only prohibit direct discrimination, but also indirect discrimination, and to absorb the latest jointly negotiated practice experience, strengthen the punishment of gender discrimination violations, and more vigorously defend the legitimate rights of women.
In recent years, the Ninja Women's Association's Joint Public Prosecution Service, civil affairs and other departments have been very effective in promoting and introducing social professional forces to engage in mediation of marriage and family conflict disputes and work against domestic violence.
The regulation summarizes and improves this, encourages the mobilization of social forces, gathers social resources to advocate for women's rights, and requires county governments at the county level to provide stable, institutional safeguards and support through the purchase of services, among other ways.
The workstation of the Xinjiang Academy of Sciences is salt-resistant to water and crushes the valley of the product by a thousand kilograms.
The reporter received from the Zhongshan Association Administration Office of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on 27 May, that the Zhongshan Association's Longping Academy of Resistance to Salt Water Workshop held in Zhongshan on the previous day had been broadcast to the field by the Resistance to Salt Water Acceptance Review Board with good news that the average saltwater resistance to saltwater has broken through a thousand kilograms of the valley.
A team of fertility experts, consisting of six experts from the Agricultural Sciences Institute of the State of Maharashtra, Yangzhou University, and the Agricultural Village of Hunan Province, collected samples of water from the Zhongshan salt series.
After expert assessment, at pH 8.8 to 9.6, salt content in soil of 5‰ to 6‰, salt water resistant to average yields of 508.8 kg.
The Executive Chairman of the Working Station of the Rungping Academician, Wang Zhenggang, said: "We intend to innovate, reform, re- cultivate and optimize the waterproof variety, improve the quality, increase the yield, and build on this year's experimentation.
The chairman of the group of experts on fertility, vice-president of the Agricultural Academy of Sciences in the province of Maharashtra, researchers said:  Under the assumption that the production elements will remain the same, I believe that continuing to strengthen the technological offensive, water resistant and salt will continue to work miracles on salty soil
The Xinjiang Union belongs to the Daxingzhang Central Film District.
In October 2018, the work of the academician 隆zh平 stood at the unveiling of the Xinjiang Union.
Dr. Longpin led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the latest cultivated salt-resistant hybrid water varieties and advanced technologies, build 960 salt-resistant water bases in the center of the Korean peninsula, adopt marginal test samples, broaden the technical route, promote local poverty-stricken populations to increase productivity, de-enrichment, and improve the quality of life.
This salt-resistant field test not only provided a scientific basis for the promotion of low-yielding fields in the salt-rich region of the RXI, but also for the cultivation of salt-water in China under equal conditions.
According to Australian Net, after a marathon-like debate and weeks of protests, on September 26th, local time, the Australian state of New South Wales passed the abortion legalization bill.
The bill has sparked political debate in the last eight weeks, and since the introduction of the bill was announced by independent MP Greenwich, there have been serious divisions within the Australian Liberal Party.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, the New Zealand Senate passed the abortion legalization bill by a vote of 26 to 14 late on 25 November, making it the third longest-running bill in New Zealand's Senate to be considered.
On the morning of January 26, after the last vote in the New York State House of Representatives, New York legalized abortion.
The bill allows women to terminate their pregnancy at 22 weeks of pregnancy, and if two doctors agree, allows women to have abortions later in pregnancy.
The Senate passed an amendment late on Thursday, allowing doctors to seek advice from the multidisciplinary subcommittee on hospital advisory committees before performing abortion surgery on women after 22 weeks of pregnancy.
In addition, the Senate amendment also included that physicians must provide appropriate care for terminally-suffering babies.
Previously, New York Governor Berry Griglin faced open criticism from conservatives over the bill, Berry Griglin intervened several times to gain more time for debate, but she did not attend the final vote.
Berry Griglin defended his absence from the vote by saying: "I need to spend time managing the entire state".
Australian Liberal Party MP Davis, who was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatened to withdraw from the new state government over the bill, and said it sparked a government crisis.
But afterwards, Davis made concessions.
Davis said: "The content of the amendments to the abortion legalization bill submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of January 26th actually provides greater safeguards for women, doctors and their families.
At the same time, Barillaro, leader of the Australian New States Party, said he was proud to be part of the government that legalized abortion.
"What we accomplished last night was historic for New York State, it legalized abortion, it no longer constitutes a criminal act, and it does not treat abortion women as criminals".

Minister of Finance昆zh: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have allocated 861.1 billion yuan of state funds to social security funds.
Finance Minister Zhong Quon said that as of now, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the allocation of some state-owned capital to social security funds, totaling a total of about 861.1 billion yuan.

In 2017, the State Council issued a plan to implement the Social Security Fund with a partial state-owned capital, requesting the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces for pilot projects.
According to Qu Qu, the work on the pre-requisites has been successful.
At the central level, three rounds of redistribution of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed, allocating a total of about 861.1 billion yuan of state capital.

昆 said that each region, each department, should be carefully organized, carefully arranged, ensure that the work of redistribution is completed as requested; strengthen the work, accurately grasp the content of the policy redistribution; strengthen communication coordination, and promptly resolve the issues of doubt.
The state funds transfer to the Social Security Fund, starting from the starting point of the Social Security Fund's cash bag, are intended to provide strong support for pension coverage.
However, the author argues that this is not a simple equity transfer, but a mathematical addition.
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Social Affairs, State Finance Commission, Tax Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission jointly issued a notice on the full implementation of the social security fund work programme, specifying a timetable for the social security fund work programme, i.e. the central and local social security fund work programme, to be fully implemented in 2019.
After the publication of the documents, departments such as the Ministry of Finance were implemented very quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance will transfer all of its holdings of the commercial bank, the 10 percent of the shares in the agricultural bank to the Social Security Fund, two share divisions worth more than 115 billion yuan.
According to the regulations, the entity that takes on the social security fund, such as the Social Security Fund, as a financial investor, enjoys the right to ownership, disposal and information rights of the state-owned shares.
The Ministry of Labour and Agriculture said in a statement that the change in ownership interests would not result in a change in shareholders and actual controllers of the Bank.
In this regard, I believe, similar divisions of state-owned enterprises are not simply changes in ownership, but can trigger a series of effects.
The first step in the partial state-sponsored social security splitting is to ensure that the state-owned enterprises are owned by the people, and that developmental achievements are shared by the people.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important sectors and sectors of the economy, with overall profitability stronger and more stable.
Among them, the leading companies are even more continuously achieving optimization and strengthening.
On July 10, the State Council's Standing Meeting decided to fully implement the allocation of some state capital to social security funds this year.
The Ministry of Finance has stated that it will work with relevant departments, in line with the deployment of the State Council's Standing Meeting, to fully implement the redistribution of some state-owned funds to social security funds, fully implement the basic pension insurance system and share the results of the development of state-owned enterprises among all citizens.
The second step of the split was to strengthen the sustainability of our social security fund, further strengthen the foundation of the social security system.
As the population ages, the social security fund is under pressure, and this time as a state fund, the subject of a redistribution, has a sustained interest rate and dividend capacity, which can not only effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provides the social security fund with a source of living water.
Estimates show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital allocated, the percentage of corporate basic pension contributions can be reduced by 1 percentage point to support enterprise basic pension insurance.
The third step of the split is to increase the stabilizer for the capital market.
The way in which the receiving entity receives the dividend is divided into the principal, the operations being the auxiliary.
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor in state-owned capital, does indeed rely on dividend gains.
However, the Social Security Fund, as a value investor in the capital market, has a stronger capital operating capacity.
For publicly traded assets in state-owned capital, Social Security's participation in holding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of publicly traded companies, promote the improvement of corporate performance, and positively impact publicly traded companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund acts as an investment benchmark, enhances shareholding, further strengthens its market influence, and plays a role as a market stabilizer.
In addition, it also helps to make full use of institutional investors' value-discovery capabilities, guide investors' rational investments, and value investments.

The U.S. Senate approved Scalia's appointment as Secretary of Labor.
The Senate of the United States Congress voted on September 26 to approve President Trump's nomination of Eugene Scalia as Secretary of Labor.
The vote was 53 for, 44 against, and no Democrat voted for Skalizh.

 Iran has been confirmed to have developed advanced centrifuges  Further suspending the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 26 September, Iran has again violated the Iran nuclear deal, using advanced centrifugal force.
Iran is reportedly gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran nuclear deal in response to US President Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, restoring and strengthening sanctions against Iran.
Iran has suspended two further commitments in July, the upcoming stockpile of hydrogen sulfide to be kept below 300 kg, and the purity of hydrogen sulfide to be no more than 3.67%, and now there are further steps to take.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran can only install about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz, to accumulate hydrogen peroxide, and also allows Iran to use only a small number of more advanced prototypes for research, but does not produce hydrogen peroxide.
If Iran succeeds in developing a more advanced centrifuge, it will be able to produce hydrogen at several times the rate it would, possibly for use in the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, a report noted:  September 25, the agency has confirmed that Iran's advanced jet-powered jet-powered aircraft Type 2 and Type 3 are being accumulated or ready to accumulate 
The International Atomic Energy Agency of the United Nations submitted this report to the Member States on 26th, and a diplomatic official responded by saying: They are busy at the Natanzsk shrinkage facility.

Even vehicles with a shade of green can see information in advance, such as changes in front red and green lights and waiting times, all traffic conditions are clear.
I've heard about driverless driving on TV before, thought it was far from us, but today finding it in our lives feels magical.

China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
The White Paper notes that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
As China's comprehensive national and international influence rapidly increases, some internationally fear that China will take a stronger path, some have proposed the so-called China threat theory.
This is a cognitive misreading, deep-seated prejudice, a psychological imbalance that has the power to eradicate it, and a deliberate distortion of its vested interests.
Achieving national prosperity, national revitalization, and people's happiness are both the dream of the Chinese people and the common dream of the peoples of the world.
China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The White Paper notes that China is the main stabilizer and driver of global economic growth, China is the largest contributor to global economic growth, Chinese technological innovation is injecting new energy into global economic growth, and the role of the future Chinese economy as a stabilizer and driver is even more emphasized.
Current world economic growth is under-developed, and a strong Chinese economy is increasingly important to the world.
China's economy is moving from rapid growth to high-quality development, new types of industrialization, informatization, urbanization, agricultural modernization, rapid progress, deep structural adjustment, industrial optimization, continuous improvement, and new economic growth points are emerging.
A study by the McKinsey Global Research Institute estimates that by 2040, the merger of China and the rest of the world's economies is expected to create an economic value of $22 trillion to $37 trillion, equivalent to 15% - 26% of the global economy.
The White Paper emphasizes that the Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes, deeply fused together.
More stable economic performance, higher growth quality, a China with a sustainable growth outlook, is a long-term benefit to the world economy.
To see China's economic development as a threat and challenge, to try to push China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain, value chain, to make China's economic break with the world economy, is both impossible and harmful.
The White Paper notes that the full extent of the opening up to the outside world allows countries to share Chinese dividends and create more opportunities to share them.
China is determined to stick to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of openness, achieve greater strength, achieve a higher level of openness to the outside world, China has the most potential consumer market in the world, China is the most attractive investment destination, reach out to more countries on a larger scale.
 Opening up should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-sided.
Mutual benefit is a long-lasting, two-way talent.
China's commitment to continuously expand imports, ease market access, improve business environment, strengthen intellectual property protection, and other countries should also expand openness, take appropriate steps, and strive to improve their own business environment, the White Paper says.
Only if all parties move forward can we create an environment of open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, and win-win development, make the cake of common development bigger, and form a community of mutually beneficial and win-win interests.
The White Paper notes that China provides more public goods to the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality co-operation, establishing a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively engaging in foreign aid.
China's development is benefitting the international community, and it never forgets the international community to provide the international community with more and better public goods.

The demonstration led to the downfall of the president of Egypt in the mountains, and the authorities showed strong repression.
The hashtags and social media are encouraging the Egyptian masses to take to the streets today, peacefully demanding President Sessions's removal from office.
But authorities have indicated that they intend to use force to suppress them.
Since the then-Chairman of the Armed Forces, Sisi, launched a military coup in 2013 to seize power, the practice of expressing dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest would be in extreme danger.
According to the Cairo-based NGO Egypt Economic and Social Rights Center, more than 1,900 people have been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests last weekend demanding Sisi's ouster.
The lavish corruption charges against Sessi and his family led to thousands of protesters taking to the streets on the 20th.
The Egyptian Interior Ministry yesterday made a firm statement that any attempt to undermine the stability of the country would be decisively and decisively countered.
Cairo's city centre has long been on high alert, with the 2011 Egyptian Revolution blasting out of Tahrir Square, where the streets around the city are visible as police, security vehicles and uniformed police.
According to the Peninsula TV channel, security forces detained several important scholars and social figures for 25 days, including Cairo University professor of political science, noted columnist Nafa.
He tweeted on 24th: "I have no doubt that continuing to allow Cecily's absolute rule will cause disaster.
He immediately abdicated in accordance with the interests of Egypt.
Before Nafa was arrested, Hosni, a former Egyptian military chief of staff and spokesman for the security forces, was detained.
Anzhong was arrested last year after trying to run for president with Sessi.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that, at a time when the economic hardships of the poor and middle class are escalating, the method of sweeping out dissidents reflects the instability and fragility of the government.
Opposition leader Ayman Nour, who once ran for president, said: "The arrest of the rebels highlights the regime's indifference to the Egyptian people, and how much it fears itself.
 Because the economy had already been thrown into disarray by him, coupled with the widespread implementation of political repression, Cesi tried to convey a clear message to important generals and politicians who could replace him.
Norr pointed out that under the assumption that the socio-economic situation continues to deteriorate, the government's use of high-pressure methods will only increase the anger of the people.
Since the fear barrier has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain, who was a contractor for the Egyptian military, started uploading a series of videos earlier this month, taking advantage of government corruption, and sparking a small wave of demonstrations over the weekend in different cities.
Ali said his company, Amtrak General Contract, does not have to go through a legal tender process to get lucrative contracts, stressing the corruption of the military and the Sisi family, including First Lady Tissar Amer al-Sisi.
He deeply regretted that he had been involved in the affair.
Aliz, who claimed to have helped the wealthy palace and luxury hotels of Sesigai, contrasted the extreme poverty of the Egyptians today, and the other had not paid.
On Twitter, such as the hashtags "Stand up for You're Not Alone", "Cessie You're Done", "Cessie Rolls", "Next Friday" and others, have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retweets, calling on people to peacefully take to the streets to demand that Cessie step down.
The Twitter of Egyptian Hollywood star Zhi Amwayek has nearly seven million followers.
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday: "Cessi is doomed... he is done, those who support him are now about to make a big mistake".

爱民 said, "In the last 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens leaving the country has increased dramatically, from an average annual growth of less than a million people before the reform and opening up to hundreds of billions of people every year today; at the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens' overseas travel is more guaranteed, and the consular protection and assistance work objects are also expanding from overseas to all kinds of groups such as Chinese citizens, tourists, foreign students, and business workers".
According to statistics, since the 18th Party Congress, our organization has carried out more than 10 major operations to evacuate or transfer Chinese citizens overseas, evacuating more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from areas of high security and unrest.

According to the Chinese government, China had concluded visa waivers agreements with 14 countries to date, covering passengers with ordinary passports.
Moreover, more and more countries unilaterally provide Chinese citizens with visa-free or landing visa-free entry facilities.
Forty-two countries and regions, including Thailand, Egypt and others, unilaterally grant Chinese citizens with ordinary passports a landing visa, while 15 countries and regions, including Indonesia, unilaterally allow Chinese citizens with ordinary passports to enter without a visa.
In addition to visa-free, landing visa arrangements, Chinese citizenship visa applications are becoming more convenient, and the procedure is becoming simpler.
As of late August, China had reached agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify the visa procedure.
These include mutual travel visas issued for businessmen for 10 years with the United States, Canada, Israel, Argentina, and the United Kingdom, mutual travel, business, visitation, and visa arrangements for businessmen for more than two years.
Britain, Belgium and France have jointly launched a one-stop visa service, while Italy, Singapore and France will reduce the time to receive visas to 48, 36 and 24 hours respectively.
For business people who travel frequently abroad, APEC business travel cards with multiple entry/entry/passage fees are a good option.
According to the people, holding this travel card is equivalent to obtaining multiple-entry visas for five years from 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific, meaning a lot for business people, especially private entrepreneurs, to go out.

The Port and Shipping Organization of the Iranian Province of Hormuzzhan confirmed that the commander and crew of the ship had made a formal and written commitment, although the ship was seized, but they had no claim to the claim.
Swedish ship owner of the steamship Steyna Bulk also said that the ship was sailing from the port of Abbas.
In addition,Refinitiv's ship tracking data also found that the tanker started moving on the 27th and left the port of Abbas.
The British-flagged Stena Impero tanker was seized by Iran in July this year.
A company spokesman said the tanker was preparing to leave the port of Abbas.
Two weeks after the British seized an Iranian tanker in the Strait of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard detained the tanker Stena Impero at the Strait of Hormuz.
The ship was released in August.
Earlier this week, a spokesman for the Iranian government said that all legal procedures required to release the USS Stannah Empire had been completed.
But Iran's side said the investigation was still ongoing.
Several Iranian media outlets have also released videos of the tanker's departure.
On July 19, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized a British tanker, the Stanna Empire, in Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz, and then sent it to the port of Abbas.
Iran was hit by the tanker Grace I, which sailed from the Straits of Gibraltar.
Furthermore, on July 4, British overseas territory Gibraltar authorities seized the tanker Grace I, loaded with Iranian crude oil, in the Strait of Gibraltar on suspicion of violating EU sanctions for the transport of oil to Syria.
A little over a month later, on August 15, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of the first Grace.
This afternoon, a conference on the topic of education, inspection and reform of work at all provincial undergraduate universities was held in Yangsha.
Ulan, deputy secretary of the provincial commission, stressed that the need to improve political position, strengthen political responsibility, and improve the quality of the work of high-schools in the field of party-building, policy and reform, with the effectiveness of thematic education, should be emphasized.
Ulan fully acknowledges the initial results of the undergraduate colleges in the second batch of subject education.
She pointed out that conducting education on the theme of remembering mission is a major deployment by the Party Central, and that undergraduate universities should learn more about implementing the spirit of the keynote address delivered by General Secretary Xi Jinping on conducting education on the theme of remembering mission.

The party committee of the five universities, including Hunan University, gave a speech in which the party was responsible for the gay community, and the provincial and provincial units directly responsible for gay affairs.
Two large high-pressure engineering projects were carried out.
On 26th, from the east to south, the project will be carried out on the high-voltage direct current transmission line of 1100 kV ± 1 kV, and the transmission line of 1000 kV at the high-voltage transmission line of the GIL integrated pipeline project will be carried out on the same day.
Both projects have achieved highs in their respective fields of current world power transmission technology, and after the launch will allow China's energy-optimized broad-based allocation to be significantly improved.
Guozh智, chief economist of the National Energy Agency, said the East-South project is the world's largest electricity transmission capacity, the longest transmission distance.
Its investment is of great importance for promoting the development of Xinjiang energy base, ensuring the electricity supply of the WASHINGTON region, and more.
GIL, or gas insulation metal, is the closed transmission line.
The SuTong pipeline engineering, which created the record for the highest global voltage level of GIL engineering, the strongest transmission capacity, achieved the highest voltage level of the Chinese-owned core grid for the operation of the twin-link transmission network.
According to the National Electricity Network Company, the electricity transmission distance between the East and South Zhongshan projects is 3324 kilometers.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15% of electricity will be lost along the way, and the project has been a major step in the R&D process, significantly increasing the economic transmission distance to more than 3,000 kilometers.
After the project is launched, the project can transmit 100 million degrees of electricity every 8 hours and 20 minutes, helping to solve the problem of disrupting existing new energy consumption in Xinjiang.
zh According to full load estimates, the annual electricity transmission of a single line will reach 600 to 85 billion kilowatt hours, enough to meet more than half of Shanghai's entire year of electricity consumption.
The SUNGGIL integrated pipeline project is a control project of the high-voltage transmission network that runs across the Yangtze River.
If the conventional river-crossing routes were to be used, two giant iron towers over 450 metres in height would be needed on the Yangtze River, and an artificial island the size of a football field over four would be built for each iron tower.
In this regard, the bold innovation of the national grid, the development of the compact and special high-voltage transmission GIL transmission technology, through a channel from underwater river, avoided the impact on the gold channel.
Two projects that boost China's manufacturing capacity for electrical and industrial equipment have taken a new leap.
Currently, the national grid has been built in 10 to 11 straight high-voltage projects, and another 4 to 3 straight is under construction.
Foreign Exchange Service: The structure of our foreign debt continues to improve and the stability of our foreign debt is strengthened.
  Overall, the structure of our foreign debt continues to improve, the stability of our foreign debt increases  zh
Wang Chun-ing, chief economist and spokesman for the National Exchange Administration, said on 27 March that the main indicators of our foreign debt were within the internationally recognized safety line, while the overall foreign debt risk was manageable.
Wang Chun Ying made the above statement in response to a reporter's question when the Foreign Exchange Service released the data on its foreign debt at the end of June 2019, the same day.
Data shows that as of the end of June 2019, China's total external debt balance (including foreign currency) was $199.8 billion, up from $26.3 billion at the end of March 2019, an increase of 1.3 percent, mainly due to the growth in debt securities balance.
In the second quarter of 2019, China's total external debt growth of more than seventy percent was driven by non-residents buying domestic yuan bonds, and non-residents were mainly middle- and long-term investors such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, the medium- and long-term debt ratio rose by three percentage points at the end of March 2019, while the foreign exchange ratio rose by one percentage point at the end of March 2019.
Wang Chun-ing said that with domestic yuan bonds being included in the Bloomberg Global Comprehensive Index in April 2019, international investors have further increased their recognition of the Chinese bond market, continuing to increase domestic yuan bonds.
 Our international expenses are balanced overall, and foreign debt risk is controllable 
The reporter learned from Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences on 27th June that at present, Yunnan grassland greed has been effectively controlled, without causing major flooding disasters, and the control work has achieved phased results.
In January of this year, Yunnan Province first discovered grassland greed, which was migrated from abroad, and subsequently confirmed in 129 counties of Yunnan, as grassland greed also gradually spread from Yunnan to mainland China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
The grasshopper is a multi-focused, long-distance migratory important agricultural pest native to the tropical and subtropical Americas, and is a major migratory pest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's global warning, characterized by international, migratory, outbreaks and devastating effects.
The pest harms more than 80 crops of corn, sugar cane, and high-yielding crops, causing up to 70% of production loss.
The problem is that there is no registered pesticide for the pest in China.
Since the grassland greed invasion of Yunnan, Yunnan's Agricultural Science Academy has selected researchers, led the innovation team of the Yunnan Agricultural Science Academy of Agriculture and the Green Protection Province's Cross-border Harmful Biology Cooperative, and has taken the lead in field surveys, sampling, and technical guidance and demonstration.
The team has already mastered the characteristics of the grassland of Yunnan, the insect-infested resources, the outdoor insect-infested species, the migration trajectory of the population, the toxicity of drugs and the field control effect.
They actively conducted research and application of green control technologies, implemented new green control technologies such as population monitoring, insect trapping, scientific medicines and agricultural measures, the control effect in the demonstration area has reached more than 90%, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural resources and the ecological environment, providing technical guarantees for Yunnan's effective control of the grassland greed and sustainable governance.
At present, the Yunnan grassland greed has been effectively controlled, without causing major floods and disasters, and the control work has achieved phased results.
The next step, Yunnan Agricultural Science College will focus on developing ecological mechanisms for populations migrating to invade the outbreak, breaking through the biogeochemical and green prevention technology system.
At the same time, actively promote international cross-border cooperation, strive to establish joint focus laboratories and joint monitoring sites and demonstration zones abroad, to enhance the monitoring and forecasting capabilities of all aspects of the Yuzhanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshanshan

Social capital is required to qualify for the right to operate rural land.
 Rural land management transfer management measuresPublicly seeking advice Proposal for regulation of social capital movements such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management rights
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website published a notice of public consultation on the management of the movement of rural land management rights (revised draft request for comment) (hereinafter abbreviated as the opinion document), increased the control and risk prevention of the movement of social capital to obtain land management rights, such as for industrial and commercial enterprises.
The public is invited to comment on the issue publicly.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that, in order to implement the newly amended Law on Land Contract , further consolidate and improve the basic rural system of operations, deepen the reform of the rural land system, implement the system of three-tiered allocation, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has formulated a draft opinion on the revision of the management of the transfer of the transfer of the operating power of the rural land contract.
A Beijing Youth newspaper reporter learned that the first published opinion polls had several important changes.
The newly amended Land Contract Act clarifies the scope of land transfers, implements the concept of the three-tiered rights division, sets out the land contracting rights and land management rights respectively, and makes a clear distinction between land contracting rights transfer, exchange and land management rights transfer (lease, transfer, share or otherwise).
In this draft opinion, in order to implement the concept of three-tiered rights, effectively respond to the principles of the Land Contract Act, and considering the large differences between land transfer and land contract transfer, transfer, and other aspects of the transfer, the draft amendment defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on land transfer, transfer including leasing, share transfer, etc., and changing the name of the regulatory framework from the Land Contract Act to the Land Contract Act to the Land Contract Act.
 Provisions will be made for the transfer of the rights to operate the land contract and the exchange of alternate management arrangements.
The opinion notes that in the context of the separation of powers, the farmers' share of the land is only a limited term of land management.
In theory, even if the bankruptcy settlement occurs, farmers only run the risk of losing their right to operate for a certain period, so providing for the return of the contractor to the original contractor is no longer legally necessary, nor does it conflict with bankruptcy law.
To address the problem of preventing the risk of land loss to farmers, methods have been developed in practice to prioritize shares, pre-lease shares, buy back shares, and so on.
Given the more mature theoretical exploration of preferred stock in company law, it is recommended to use it as an advocacy provision to prevent risk of loss of equity.
