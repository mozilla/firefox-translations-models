This not only confirms that certain dinosaurs have feathers, a theory already widely spread, but provide specific details that generally cannot be given by fossils, e.g. color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are brown in color at the top with the bottom being pale or carotenoid.
The study also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a stem that grows well, which is called the racis, but has other fur characteristics - thorns and barbuls - researchers concluded that the racks are likely an evolutionary development of these other features that come later.
The fur structure suggests that it is not used for the purpose of flying but more on temperature control or for display. The researchers suggested, although the tail was a young-age dinosaur tail, the sample showed feathers belonged to an adult and not a young one.
The researchers suggested that although it was a young dinosaur tail, the samples showed adult feathers and not the fine feathers of the chicks.

Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in the court with a closed face.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road was temporarily closed for emergency services to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya is already in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for allegedly killing his son.
He was in custody pending charges and trial, but any evidence of witnesses may have been tarnished as his photos were publicly published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but the function of justice in Scotland is different and the court assumes photo publications could lead to prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University stated “the reporter is seen walking on a dangerous route if he publishes a photo and so on belongs to the suspect.” 
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the entire prosecution, has shown journalists who no further comment will be made at least until the charges.
Based on the leak of documents, the document refers to the boundary dispute claimed by Palestine based on the borders of the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered were reported to include the future state of Jerusalem where it was sacred for both countries and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demanded a continuing military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement was signed while the PA agreed to military presence for only five years.
The shooter in the trial of additional pest control should be strictly supervised by the ranger, while the trial is monitored and evaluated in terms of its effectiveness.
In the cooperation of NPWS and the Sports Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited, under the Sports Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conversation and Heritage with NPWS, four shooters were selected for the first shooting operation to receive comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in at the new Temporary Election Council (CEP) comprising nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
The President's Commission last month recommended the withdrawal of the previous CEP as part of a move to mobilise the country for the implementation of new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime riots that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were caused by failure to hold elections, some have been around since 2011.
Some 60 cases of overheated malfunctioning ipods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four light burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they were aware of 27 accidents linked to the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had announced an addition of 34 overheating events, but the company considered it “not serious.” 
The ministry has responded by calling for a delay from Apple’s report “very disappointing”.
Earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time pg (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no tsunami indicators.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by seizing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired M16 weapons at tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed killed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographer then took the place of an old woman because she had to use the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began her duties at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature dressing in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone was given it would accelerate the maturity of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said “Luna is the first Queen of the Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two months. It's pretty unique like him. Strong woman.” 
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented “Luna as good as me...maybe more...love him and will miss him...may the deceased be in heaven.” 
Of the 1,400 people voted before the 2010 federal election, those against Australia became a republic up by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's rule.
34 percent of those in this survey think Queen Elizabeth II would become the last king of Australia.
At an extreme public opinion, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible while 31 percent believe that Australia should not be a republic.
Olympic gold medalists were supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and in three row races at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints resulted in many doubting his fitness.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to endure his pain because it was banned from the Match.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Centrak Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the findings used different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comet may be a source of water delivery to the earth along with organic matter that can form protein and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth has formed, since comets with the Earth once upon a time.
Cuomo, 53, began his duties as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month that allowed same-sex marriage.
He cited the rumor as “political and superstitious discussion”.
He was speculated to become president in 2016.
NextGen is a FAA claim system that will allow the aircraft to fly into a shorter route and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than old-based technology based on site radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate the aircraft's location more accurately and provide more accurate information to the pilots.
No additional transportation is available and the top-ground train will not stop at Wembley, while parking and parking and ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fear of the lack of transport raises the possibility that the game will be carried out without a team supporter.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of new bird species in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species has evolved after just two generations, although this process is believed to take longer, as the breeding between an endemic finch bird in Darwin, fortes Geospiza, and the immigrant cactus finch bird, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed in different types of forms. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be pulled into thin wires, which can then be twisted and weaved. It can be hammered or grinded into a sheet.
It can be produced very thin, and stick to other metals. It can be made so thin that it can be used to decorate a book with a hand drawing called “squeaked manuscript”.
This is called chemical pH. You can produce a marker using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice will change color depending on how acidic or base (alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ion (H letter in pH) in the chemical tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton with an electron that is removed (because the hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron).
Round both dry powder and then, with clean wet hands, clot the powder into balls.
The liquid on the hands will act to hear the outer layer, which will feel strange and form a layer like a shell.
The city of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro has a splash toilet in almost every house connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Sewage was found in the houses of the cities of Minoan, Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There are also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. During the Roman civilization, the toilet became part of a public bathhouse where men and women single freely.
When you call someone who is far away thousands of miles, it means you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space got a call and bounced it back down, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with our lighting and view.
It took a giant rocket over 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in a wonderful way. The biggest contribution of the wheel to us is the easier and faster production of transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other transport devices.
Under them more medium-sized cats that eat prey medium size from rabbits to kijang and kancil.
Finally, there are many small-sized cats (including wild cats) that eat more small prey such as insects, mice, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special task for every cat that prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most socially popular cat, and live in a large group called “lion “hion”.
A group of lions is formed from one to three adult males, along with as many as thirty females and their offspring.
Women are often close to each other, because they consist of a large relative of the sister and daughter.
Lion Prides acts just like a group of wolf or dogs, the shocking animal is similar to the behavior of a lion (but not a big cat) and is also very dangerous to its prey.
Ready to attack, tigers can climb (although not so good), swim, jump long distances and attract with five-fold strength than strong humans.
Tigers are in the same group (Genus Panthera) such as lions, leopards, and jaguar. Only four types of cats can roar.
Tigers are not like the lion's full voice, more than tangled words, the screams of words.
The tigers eat small animals. It will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if possible. Almost all animals they hunt are much smaller than their size.
Scientists think that the tiger oslot follows and searches for animals to eat (Victim) through the sense of smell, which is the smell of the soil that he has ever passed through.
Ocelot can see well using night vision, and even move slowly. Ocelot hunted his prey by hiding in an environment that resembled his body color and then pounced his prey.
When small groups of living beings (small populations) separate from which they originate from (e.g. if they travel across the mountains or rivers, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily relocate) they often end up in different environments than before.
This new environment there are different sources and rivals, therefore new populations will require different characteristics or adaptations to be strong competitive than they had previously had to.
The original inhabitants do not change at all, they still need adjustments just like before.
Over time, as new residents who start to adapt to the new environment, they begin to look less and less like other residents.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they are no longer from the same species.
We call this process of conception, which means the formation of new species. The perception is an inevitable effect and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen inhaled by humans and take the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans (in breath).
Plants produce food from sunlight through photosynthesis. It also gives shade.
We built our house out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals can not survive.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator of his time, making it fear of anything, except for other mossaurs.
The long jaw is equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional set located on its palate, which means there is no way out for anything that crosses the path.
We're not sure, it may have a forked tongue. The diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and even it may be a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, and even a giant dinosaur like T. rex won't be able to compete with it.
While most of their foods we'll know, Romans also have strange or strange feast food, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor people and women who eat their food while sitting in a chair, the rich like to make a banquet together where they will relax by their side when they eat their food.
Ancient Roman dishes were unlikely to include foods brought to Europe from America or Asia in the later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians have built a primary temple for each of their gods who are considered to be the house of the gods.
The people will bring sacrifices to the gods and priests will try to meet the needs of the gods through various ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an indoor shrine that is only allowed to the priest.
Sometimes a special pyramid-shaped tower called a zigurat, was built to be part of the temples.
The tower is a sanctuary for the deity.
In a warm climate in the Middle East, the house is no longer so important.
Most of the Hebrew family lives take place in an open environment.
Women cook in the yard; the shop is just an open counter facing the street. Stones have been used to build houses.
There is no large forest in Canaan land, therefore wood is a very expensive resource.
Greenland is rare. According to the Norse saga, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for killing, and while on the west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But without heeding his discovery, the Eskimo tribe had settled there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavia', there are many differences in the people, king, culture and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie 'National Treasure', you might think of a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written behind the Declaration of Independence “Declaration of Original Independence dated 4th July 1776”. The text is listed under the document, reversed.
While no one knows who wrote it, it was known that at the beginning of his life, this large document patch (it measured 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) rolled up for storage.
So, it is possible that the notation is added only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the following clashes have liberated northern France, but the southern part has yet to be liberated.
It was ruled by the French “Vichy”. They were French people who made a peace alliance with Germany in 1940 and had chosen to cooperate with the colonialists instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the attack was called “Operation Dragoon”.
In just two weeks, the Free American and French troops liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in an integrated manner, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilist, meaning public, associated with the Latin Civis, meaning citizen, and civitas which means city or city, and it also nevertheless defines the size of society.
The cities are the beginning of a country. The culture of civilization signifies the spread of knowledge from generation to generation, traces of ever-existing culture and fair spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and failing to be recognized as a perfect civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of the Coalition.
Congress has no power to impose taxes and, because there is no national judicial executive, it depends on the state's power, which is often not cooperating, to enforce all the acts of it.
It also has no right to reject tax laws and interstate tariffs.
This article calls for consent from all districts before they can amend and the district to take the federal government as a light as their representatives are often absent.
Italy national football, along with the German football team, was the second most successful in the world and was the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheelchair-shoe hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the Northern part, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan contains nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the Japanese State's island clusters/groups, the Japanese state from a geographical stand, is commonly called an island.
As early as the 15th century Taiwan began to be seen and recorded by European traders who called the island IIha Formosa, or a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, creating a transformation on the practice of the production of indigenous grains and employing Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) controlled the coastal areas of the west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Empire signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which he ceded power over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Inthuatana, Sun Temple and Three-Speaked Room.
Most of the buildings have been refurbished to give tourists the idea of how they look original.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu would have been restored and the restoration work continued until today
For example, the most common image in the fortographic format in the world is 35mm, which is equivalent to the dominant size of the film at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced to date, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the digital camera image detector format.
The 35mm format is actually, quite confusing, 36mm wide times 24mm high.
The ratio of aspects of this format (divided into twelve to get the simplest overall ratio) that is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. formats from the APS family) are equal to or almost identical to this aspect ratio.
One-third rule that is often abused and ridiculed is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining an orderly size in the image.
It states that the most effective place for a major subject is the intersection between the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this time in the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which became very rich and powerful, began to be doubted.
For over a thousand years Christianity has binded European countries together despite differences in language and customs. I'm
His absolute power affects everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main thrusts of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and misery and the church's financial funds are specific to that reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years and the power and money force led many to question whether this belief had been fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of the battle, Britain began a German naval blockade.
The strategy proved to be effective, cutting off the vital supply of the military and civilians, although these restrictions did not comply with generally accepted international law created by several international treaties two centuries ago.
Britain is mining international water to prevent any ship from entering the entire ocean, causing danger even ordinary ships.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expects a similar response to the unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the common attitude for most people and countries was a pasicism and isolation.
After seeing the horror and tyranny of war during the First World War, some countries want to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer with the Edison Company in New York City.
He reached the US with 4 cents in his name, a poem and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from the old workplace) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way to show varying time periods, each level from China or each powerful family at that time had its own dynasty.
There are also times between each dynasty that are unstable and divided. The most famous of these days is the time of the Three Kingdoms which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and Jin.
During that time, a fierce war broke out between several nobles who took the throne.
Three Kingdoms is an era of bloodshed in the history of Ancient China thousands of dead people fighting to sit in the highest chair in the big palace in Xi’an.
Various social and political impacts will exist such as the use of the metric system, the change from absolute government to the republican system, as well as the awareness and spirit of nationalism that the country belongs to the people and not a single leader.
As well as, after the Revolution, the job is open to all male applicants who allow those who are most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military reason the reason behind the military position based on the current class is based on calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many people of the working class who were oppressed from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad is very interested in this extraordinary life. He often visited a cave later known as “Hira” in Mount Noor (light) to think.
he digs himself, lasts all the time, giving a very clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on the top of a mountain in northern Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is not easy to find even if a person knows his existence. After stepping into this cave, it was completely quiet.
There is nothing visible but the bright and beautiful heavens and mountains around them. Only the whispers of the world can be heard or seen from inside this cave.
The great pyramids in Giza are one of the seven wonders of the world that are still upright today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid was one of the many pyramidal structures built to remember the deceased Pharaoh.
In the Giza Plateau, or “Nekropolis Giza” in the Valley of the Dead Egyptians there are several pyramids (among the largest pyramids), some small tombs, some great temples, and the fantastic Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were developed in honor of the wife and family members of Khufu.
The “upper picker” is similar to the letter V and “rubber” is similar in the stable or square form without the bottom.
Top means, you should start from the end and push the bow, and bottom means, you should start on the frog (the part by which your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow<i> </i> usually produces a soft sound while down-bow produces louder and more assertive sounds.
It is free to write your own signs, but it should be remembered that the bow marked printed is there for musical purposes. Therefore, they should be respected.
The frightened King of Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two little children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a group of women at the market.
By the carriages, they returned to Paris and surrounded by a group of people screaming and shouting posing a threat to the King and Queen.
The mob group had forced the King and the Queen to open with their wide viscout windows.
At one point, a mob raises the head of the royal guard who was killed in the veralles in front of the terrified Queen.
The U.S. imperialism war on the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the floating bond expenses and benefits in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street's bankhouse.
Of course, great profits are related to the protracted exploitation of Filipinos who would be the fundamental gain of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that has triggered the creation of the order.
The period in which the event of a recurrent occurrence was known as the High Middle Ages of European historical periods in the 11th century 12 and 13 (AD 1000 -1300)
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas practiced, from technological advances or technological priorities to the strong feeling that human destiny is driven by logic associated with scientific law manifested through technology.
Most technological determinism interpretations share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows the path beyond cultural or political influence, and technology has a “impact” on the existing society, from the social situation.
For example, one might say that motor vehicles lead to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not viable for only a few cars, so a new method of production was developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The ownership of very high cars also resulted in an increase in road accidents that led to the creation of new techniques in healthcare to restore the injured part of the body.
Romantism has a huge element of cultural determinism, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography forms individuals, and with the time that the passage of the emergence of these customs and cultures related to this geography. And this, which is more harmonious with the position of society, is better than the law imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way Paris is known as the center of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople is considered the center of feudal European fashion.
It is known as a luxury centre starting around 400 Years of AD and lasts up to around 1100 AD.
His status deteriorated in the twelfth century mainly due to the return of the Crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what was offered in the Byzantine market.
The exchange of the title of Fashion Model from Constantinople to Paris is done.
Gothic style peaked in the period between 10 - 11th century and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothes were strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the style in the west may be 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the biggest developments at that time as a result of the crusade is that people began to use buttons to tie clothes.
Self-sufficiency farming is an agricultural implemented to produce food for the needs of agricultural members and out their way.
Self-sufficiency farming is a simple, often organic system, which uses stored seeds that come from one ecological area and combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were involved in agriculture as a living remuneration, and this is still a fact in many countries flourished.
Subcultures unite equal-minded individuals who feel they are neglected by the standards of society and allow them to develop their identity.
Subculture can be distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of its members.
The qualities that define different branches of culture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, sexual politics, geography or a combination of factors.
Members of a branch of culture usually exhibit their membership through a certain style symbolically, whether in fashion, behavior, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to describe the importance of socialization is to take into account some unfortunate cases of neglected children, misfortune, or abuse intentionally, unsocializing with adults when they are large.
Such children are called “feral” or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually parents themselves); in some cases the child neglects this is caused by parents pushing the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Ferral children may have suffered severe or traumatic child abuse before being abandoned or escaping.
Other children are allegedly raised by animals; some are said to live alone in the forest.
When fully elevated by a non-human animal, a ferral child will show behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like the animal that cares for it, such as fear or indifferent nature of humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding gives more than that.
Scaffolding is not a way for learning but more precise assistance: to provide support to individuals through new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or a new project start.
Scaffolding can be either virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a scaffold and so is a small paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and acts to question, help, and explain the procedure that may be difficult to deal with the student himself.
Children are placed with foster families for a variety of reasons that include neglect, abuse and also for extortion purposes.
No child should grow up in an environment that has no caregive, care and educate, but they do.
We see the Preservation System as a safety zone for these children.
Our adoptive child care system should provide a safe home, a loving care, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Care for upbringing should provide all the requirements that cannot be provided at home where the child is taken.
The Internet combines mass elements and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach of use and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “possion” are proposed as an important motivation for the use of the Internet (James et al, 1995).
“Personal engagement” and “long-term relations” have been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the audience’s reaction to the website.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expression, facial movements last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting the small changes of the face correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper President Speaks, shows how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage but can accurately assess sincerity.
He suggested that the ability to translate human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
The twentieth century studies have shown that there are two types of genetic variation groups: hidden and real ones.
New genetic changes in the increase in mutations and selections remove from the collection of changes highlighted.
Segregation and re-revamping variations between two groups and each generation.
In savanna, it is very difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet the needs of amino acids from existing crop sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so will have serious consequences: increased depression, unbalanced nutrition, and ending with death.
The most readily available plant source is the protein found in foliage and legumes, but this is difficult to digest by primates like us unless it is cooked.
On the other hand, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but it provides high-quantity proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors cope with their “protein problems” in the same way as the cimp in savanna did today.
Sleep disorder is the process of knowingly waking up during your normal sleep period and fall asleep in a while (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a silent alarm clock to be aware without developing you completely.
If you find yourself reset the clock in your sleep, the clock can be placed next to the other part of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Options based on other biorhythms involving abundant liquid drinks (especially water or tea, unknown diuretics) before going to bed, forcing a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of peace of one's soul has the opposite correlation to the amount of tension of a person's body and soul.
The lower the pressure, the more there is a positive life spirit. Everyone has the potential to find a truly and complete peace.
Everyone can get awareness. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own stress and negative traits.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but has been extended by the path of love of the Mahayana and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism has a very simple principle. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a whole love path.
Kundalini energy (energy consciousness) is triggered with Kundalini Yoga through yoga posture, breathing exercises, spells and visualization.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is the God Yoga. Depicting the various gods clear the energy channels, activating the horizon and internal consciousness are created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War 2, which led to cooperation between KRSS and the US. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes and cultures has caused the countries to quarrel.
Two years after the end of the war, the former alliance now became enemies and the Cold War began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will be clearly fought by proxy troops on the battlefield from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The 17th of September 1939, Poland's defense was destroyed, and the only hope was to reverse and rearrange along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete in the day, after 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian ranks after invading the eastern part of Poland by breaching the Treaty of Riga Peace, the Soviet-Poland Neutrality Treaty, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using a ship to transport goods is the most effective method of moving large amounts of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the task of the navy is to ensure that your country retains its ability to move society and goods, while disrupting the ability of your enemies to move their communities and goods.
One of the most famous examples of this is the North Atlantic WWI campaign. Americans try to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which uses the U-bot is trying to stop the traffic.
If the Alliance had failed, Germany might be able to conquer Britain just like the other parts of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient culture and people began to breed it to get milk, wool, meat and skin more easily.
Domestic goats are generally preserved in flocks wandering in hills or other grazing fields, often taken care of by sheep herders who are usually children or adolescents, similar to shepherds better known now. This method of sheding is still used today.
The wagon was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriage track consisted only of parallel wooden boards, it allowed the horse to pull it to reach higher speeds and draw heavier loads than the rougher roads of that time.
Cross-binding is introduced quite early to hold a local track. The slander, however, is realized that the track will be more efficient if it has an iron strip on the top.
This has become a habit, but the iron has made the wagon wooden wheel to wear out.
Over time, the wooden wheel was replaced with an iron wheel. In 1767, the first fully-air iron track was launched.
The first known transport was walking, humans began walking vertically two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means men upright).
Their supervisor, the Australopithecus, did not run uprightly.
Bipedal specializations were found in the Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start a life friendly towards the environment, we can join forces with environmental movements, and even we can become activists to reduce the suffering of the future in a certain extent.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we have to find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite clear that the world is changing abundantly because of the scientific and technological advances of man and the problem becomes greater due to the excessive population and the affluent human lifestyle.
After being adopted by the congress on the 4th of July, a written draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the John Dunlap printing shop located a few blocks away.
The night between 150 and 200 copies have been made, now known as “Dunlap broadsides”.
The first reading of this document to the public was by John Nixon on the page of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washinton on the 6th of July, which was read out to his team in New York on July 9th. I arrived in London on the 10th of August.
The 25-piece of Dunlap wide-sided books is known to still exist is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original handwritten copy is gone.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and was alive. We call it a bird.
Many people don't think it's a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
It has scaly and clawy legs, lay eggs, and walks on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can contain only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and those numbers are known as binary numerals, or bits, in computer terms.
Internal poisoning cannot be proven quickly. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally enough that the diagnosis is made immediately.
The best indications for internal poisoning may be the omission of an open medicine container or poisonous household detergent.
Check the label for the first aid instructions specific to that specific poison.
The term “bug” is used by formal entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient habits with bugs, an insect that has adapted well to become a human parasite.
Both the killer and massagers are altrisial, adjusting to live in a nest or a residential place.
Across the United States, there are around 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most neurological disease in young and middle-aged adulthood.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system formed from the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
Couples can decide that it is not the best for them or the interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make a lifting plan for their baby.
In the adoption process, the parents of the original end the right of their parents so that the other spouse can take over as the parent of the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to know how the world works through scientific methods. This method actually guides most of the scientific research.
It is not alone, experimental and experimental is a test used to remove one or more of a possible hypothesis, ask questions and make observations also guides scientific research.
Nature and philosophers focus on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's reviews were accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declines, the Western world found they ceased to study Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior usually depend heavily on the existence of the endogenous cycle and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic pace, which is not just a response to periodic external signals, has been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a standaly oscillator that will continue the duration of the free cycle even without external signals.
Hershey and Chase experiments are one of the main recommendations that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase have used a fax, or virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two tests that marked either the DNA inside the fag with radioactive phosphorus or fag protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of a piece of genetic material is affected and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in the cells of the germ droplets can be inherited by children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell or cancer death.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting the park and learning information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about organgatuang in Borneo.
Every morning, people die small towns in the car to get to work and are passed by others where workplaces are the places they just left behind.
In this dynamic shuttle transport everyone, by any means, has its relevance and support a private car-based transportation system.
Science now shows that a large carbon economy has relutted a biosphere from one of its stable states and has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the association and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about the quality of the water or bridges falling.
Why does the transport system result in such a complaint, why does it fail to function every day? Is it because of inefficient transport engineers? Or is there anything wrong at the basic level?
The Traffic Current is the study of the movement of individual and vehicle drivers between two points and the interaction that lasts with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of the flow of traffic is difficult because the driver's behavior is unpredictable with one hundred percent.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic flow is also quite consistent and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To represent a better traffic flow, the relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
This relationship helps in planning, designing, and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the first animals to be carried into the air. Their ability to fly helps them avoid enemies easily and find food and friends more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding the wings back to the side of the body.
This gives them a large area of small places to hide from predators.
Now, the only insect that can't fold its wings is a barrier and a mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System was moving around the Sun.
Some people think he is right but many believe otherwise; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second largest and largest river on Earth. It holds more than 8 times the water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river on Earth, which is six miles wide.
Full 20 percent of the water overflowing from the rivers on the planet to the oceans come from Amzon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids continued to use the stone until the end of the old kingdom, the pyramids of Giza never exceeded the size and technical excellence of their construction
The ancient Egyptian new kingdom admired their predecessors, which was over one thousand years old.
Vatican City residents are around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican cities use Italian in law and official communication.
Italian is the daily language spoken by most of those who work in the state while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have been known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, as these can all be found in nature in its original form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, had proposed the theory that everything was made from a mixture of four or more elements. It is ground, water, wind and fire.
This is more like four states of matter (in the same order): solids, liquids, gases, and plasma, although they also theorize that they are transformed into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made from small particles called atoms.
The atomic size is so small that several trillion of them can be loaded in the end of this sentence.
Therefore, pencils are a good friend to many people when they are created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods appear, pencils have been lowered to very low status and usage.
People now write messages on a computer screen, without having to be close to the pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to combine the nucleus with protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling heavy flies on the hill. Separate the nucleus again and then releases a little bit of the energy.
Certain atoms have an unstable nucleus which means it can be separated by little or without contact.
The Moon's surface is made of stone and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the earth's crust.
The crusta has a thickness of 70 km on the close side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under high ground.
There may be more mare on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. It becomes easier for lava to rise to the surface.
The content theory is focused on finding what makes people tik or appeal to them.
These theories suggest that humans have a specific need and/or desire that have been incorporated when they reach maturity as adults.
These theories look at what is found in someone who makes them want the things they want and things in their environment that will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the Maslow's Needs Hierarchy and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can arise when managers start to lead their previous colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain part of an old friend's gang.
Managers like this face difficulties in making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, performance assessments, assigning responsibilities, and responsibilities.
On the other hand, one will turn into an unrecognized person who feels that he needs to change everything that the team has done and give his personal touch.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to a dispute between the leader and the other members of the group.
Virtual teams are held at the same standard with excellence as a conventional team, but the difference is not noticeable.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for nearby physical groups.
They usually have more autonomy than conventional team members because their team may meet according to different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true “unvisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
“Invisible team” is a management team where all members report. This invisible team sets the standard for each member.
Why do organizations want to be involved in a process that takes time to establish a learning organization? One goal for the adoption of organizational learning concept is innovation.
When all resources are used effectively across every functional part of an organization, creativity and intelligence can occur.
As a result, the organizational processes that work together to overcome the barriers can lead to new innovative processes to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and the sharing of knowledge and learning of the organization.
Angel (2006), explains the Kontinum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence of a theoretical approach to cognition investigation. Therefore, it refines the research area that makes it more accurate.
The relationship between brain pathologies and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injury, trauma, cuts and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental function.
The existence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structure of the brain and processes that have not been seen.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build a simulation model where helping us to understand the process in our mind.
While AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch in computer science, dealing with attitudes, learning and intelligent customization in machines.
Research in Al involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose clients answers and questions, as well as the recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become a separate discipline, which is focused on the preparation of solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and military, as has been built in several home computers and video game software applications.
Studying is a large part of any classroom. A teacher often wants to take his students to a place that can't be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of the museum, visit the aquarium or admire the beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual tour is a great way to describe the tour and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year the website will be modified, but the older version will be saved online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blog experience with grammar and spelling errors, the presence of an audience can generally change it.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to try to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also “forcing students to better realize the world around them.” The need to attract readers inspires students to write wisely and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to expand learning beyond traditional school days.
The appropriate use of blogs “can provide opportunities for students to be more analytical and critical; through active response to internet materials, students can determine their position in the context of other people’s writings and also outline their own perspectives with related issues (Oravec. 2002)
Ottawa is the charming Canadian bilingual capital with various art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present-day Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls and the northern part is the natural beauty area of Muskoka and which passes beyond it that does not transh.

The modern city of Casablanca was discovered by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the people of Phoenecia, Rome and Merenid as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, just to let it go after the earthquake occurred in 1755.
Sultan Moroccan rebuilt the city such as the Daru I-Badya and named Casablanca by the Spanish traders who stabilized the business-based.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in Morocco.
It's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods around the old Medina such as tagins, pottery, leather goods, shisha and various small ornaments, but that's only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the streets of the city, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the ongoing state of war in the northern Kivu region.
The city is also a site for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of Africa's cheapest mountain Gorilla tracking.
You can use the bodas (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The regular price (local) is ~500 Congolese Franc for that short trip.
Combined with its hard-to-access location, “Timbuktu” has become a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites threatened by danger, due to the threat of deserts.
This was one of the main stops during the PBS special show Henry Louis Gates “Wonders of the African World”.
The city is different from other cities in the country, as it has more Arabic style than Africa.

A rapper is a support tool for the rider's foot hanging on both sides of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider but there is a safety risk due to the potential for the rider's foot to get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his legs are stuck on the scroll, he will be dragged if the horse escapes. To reduce these risks, several safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear boots with flat and relatively narrow heels and soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety bar that allow skin footrest to drop the saddle if pulled backwards by the rider.
