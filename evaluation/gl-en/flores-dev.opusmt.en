cells get fundamentals and critiques for life study; in fact, they often denomate "the basic units of life".

Elements and compounds may pass from one state to another without changes.
The nitrogen for being a gas owns the same properties as the liquid nitrogen. In liquid state it is more dense, but the molecules continue to be the same.
That water is an example more, its compound contains two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen.
It has the same molecular structure, as much as gas, liquid or solid.
Even if his physicist state varies, its chemical state stays unalterable.
Time is something that surrounds us and affects everything we do, though it's difficult to understand.
The time was object of religious, philosophers and scientists for thousands of years.
We tested time as a series of events which pass from the future through the present and towards the past.

The convergent thought patterns are technical for problem resolutions that combine ideas or different fields to find a solution.
The approach of this thought is the speed, logic and precision, also the identification of fact, the existing techniques and the build of information.
The most important factor in this position is: only a correct answer exists. Only you can think of two answers, you know, correct and incorrect.
This kind of thought is associated to certain standard or scientific processes.
People with that kind of thought have a logical thought, are able to memorize patterns, resolve problems and resolve scientific tests.
Humans are, with differences, species with greater talent to read the minds of other.
That means that we can predict properly perception, intention, knowledge, or desire for other humans.
In those skills, it's crucial to understand the purpose of others. It allows us to resolve power ambiguities of physical actions.

The IRM technique is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (RMN), which was discovered in the decades of the 30s by Felix Bloch (which worked at the University of Stantford), and Edward Purrcell (da at Harvard University).
On this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves perform the atoms to emit small radio signals.
In the year 1970, Raymond Damand, a doctor and researcher, discovered the principle to use the image by magnetic resonance as a tool for medical diagnostic diagnosis.
Four years later he hid the patent, which was the first of the world in expeding himself in the IRM field.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian finished the construction of the first image scanner by magnetic resonance of the whole "colcop" that hit the "Idomable".
