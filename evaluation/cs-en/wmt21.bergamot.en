Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, hit Škoda
Defenseman Filip Novák helped the title of vice-champion by goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor.
His team won 2:1 on the Kayserispor pitch and held the third Besiktas in a row.
Milan Škoda scored his tenth goal for Rizespor after a January transfer from Slavia, which was saved even though he succumbed 1:3 on the Fenerbahce pitch.
Novak confirmed the defender with an excellent productivity with the seventh goal in this league season.
In the 63rd minute, the Kayserispor goalkeeper just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer from an angle hit the ball into the net.
The home side managed to equalize five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of the set-up pulled the victory to its side when they successfully finished the four-on-one break.
Škoda equalized at the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce after a solo at 1:1.
Rizespor did not hold the undecided state for long, but it did not have to be sorry, because thanks to the results of the opponents, he remained three points over the relegation zone.
The competition will end with Sunday's duel of the championship Basaksehir on the Kasimpasy pitch.
A well-concealed Cave by a hersed man in the woods near Nový Bor was not really habitable
In the north of Bohemia in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in the Česká Lípa region, in the forests through which the Countess Road led, several sandstone rock formations are hidden.
Natural and artificially created.
And we're going to follow that human hand created.
The place is called the Cave at the Hermit.
In fact, there was never a hermit, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a shelter chamber apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rocky promontory and accessible up the stairs from above.
But it is practically impossible to see until the last moment.
It is revealed by the narrow stairs leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where it is just entering the rock.
Although the chamber seems to be far away from human dwellings, at the time of its creation it could be on the plateau, where there is a forest today, a field.
"The fact that the building has no window and even on a traditional place of firebox clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone bench at the back, apparently used for storing containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
On the walls of the cave there are visible traces of tools.
Breaking off the sandstone with a canine was quite simple and fast for the insiders.
It was enough to use the joints and gradually break off the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the canine trace and the method of chopping, the period of the cave can be determined by the form.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the mess that appears in it, someone sometimes sleeps there in today.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you will be intrigued under the cave of a running stream and a nearby earl's way, you will surely find the trail down as well.
And on the way out of the forest, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minařík is in artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Filip is in the best hands right now.
The institute is equipped for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hanover.
This significantly eases my situation and also the care of my daughter Finja," news server Jezdci.cz quoted Minařík's wife Katja as saying.
"Everyone is doing their best, Philip now needs time for recovery.
There is no point in giving any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," the woman said of the forty-five-year-old jockey.
The star Frankie Dettori, who won the Ascot in Ascot on Saturday, also challenged the financial support of the injured Minařík on Twitter by the starring King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, equalling the legend of Lester Piggott.
Nearly 70 thousand euros have been collected on Gofundme to date.
The aim is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million crowns).
Video referee took four goals from Sassuolo footballers, losing 0:2
Although Sassuola players scored four times in the opponent's goal in Saturday's game in Naples, but in the end they had to accept the 0:2 defeat.
None of their goals were colluded by the referee in consultation with the video because of offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record adversity of technology, so many interventions have never been thwarted by VAR has never thwarted one team.
"VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no team yet.
The new technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"Sassuola's unrecognised goals festival.
Never before has VAR been so strict on one team," added the Corriere dello Sport newspaper.
Napoli took the lead on Saturday in the 8th minute, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to have leveled.
However, Filip Djuricich's goal was not recognized after the video referee was hit because of offside.
For the same reason, other Djuricic intervention and shots of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi gradually did not pay.
The home side, on the other hand, added one more goal.
Electric cars are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they are the most charged in history
"Growth was driven by a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as a speedy development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš Chmelík, head of the clean technology department.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, electric car makers, but also Billa and Lidl supermarkets, are also claiming their share on the market.
The operators of classic petrol stations are represented by MOL.
But it doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We only started building our network for electromobility last year," company spokeswoman Jana Jusková explained.
However, the editorial board of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by ČEZ.
It follows that drivers from the stations took an average of 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the range of about one hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Apart from the small pumps up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling then took place on a free tariff.
If motorists were already paying for the collection, their typical spend was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility is mainly in the capital.
In the territory of Prague there are all five of the busiest Chargers of ČEZ, which will also be overshadowed by the entire regional cities.
Olomouc leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border area, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, there were 1274 new e-auts.
In a wide-ranging poll to the daily "Czechs in Motion", eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government’s actions on the issues of the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the solution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more vigorous approach.
The event called The Last Drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have, for example, people who have been performing for a long time against the expansion at the Turów mine, there are people who oppose the mining of gravel near Uherský Ostrah, there are people who are speaking out against the construction of nonsensical dams," said Marika Volfová on behalf of the organizers.
She said the main demands of the protesters were to create a plan to retain water in the landscape, a sharp change in agricultural policy and a subsidy system towards promoting sustainable agriculture and the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy as quickly as possible.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not the ruthless and devastating business," she said.
A stand with a petition calling on representatives of the Czech state was placed on Malostranské Square to work on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring Czech land and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "The end of the depression from the rapeseed" or "Min-all coal, more newts."
From South Moravia, Jan Škoda came to Prague from the association For Water for People, which protests against the plan of gravel mining in the Hodonín region.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140 000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned gravel mining is located only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to the reports, it is certain that the quality of the water will be endangered.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in the Karlovy Vary region to see the so-called agro-ecological farmer.
He drew attention to the pros of small farms, which do not march for returns and profit and supply residents directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, on top of that, they do not cause such destruction on the shape of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people killed in plane crashing on house in Germany
Three people died in the crash of an ultralight plane to an apartment building in West Germany today and two others were injured.
This was reported by local emergency services, according to which two crew members and one resident of the house are probably among the dead.
The aircraft crashed onto the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Vestphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five residential units in the house, was subsequently engulfed by a fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
Deputy commander of the local fire brigade Robert Meyboom said the two crew members of the aircraft had apparently died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The daily Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) reported, citing the mayor of Wesel, that she was the mother of a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with slight injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which probably served as a brake on landing.
The police are based on the fact that they come from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The machine took off from an airport in the nearby town of Marl.
Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, said the plane collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, reported that the aircraft had decayed in the air before hitting the ground.

The cause of the problem is being investigated by the Savings Bank.
"It could have been a combination of multiple factors," Kropík said.

It had 4.6 million at the end of March.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.

The course of the majority's illness is mild, only three percent of the infected have to go to the hospital
Either the milder form of coronavirus is spreading in the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
Hospital infection wards are half-empty, even though the numbers of infected are growing.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," Health Minister Adam Vojtěch confirms.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the samples were carried out by the army, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year.
Ten people were dying a day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but a maximum of two people die every day with covid-19.
The highest number of infected per capita is still Karviná, Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by hygienists in Černožice in the Hradec Králové region.
The disease was confirmed by tests in one of the nurses.
"We are tracing, we have restricted movement, we have all hygiene measures," says Martin Schhá, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the clients of the home have symptoms of the disease yet.
General testing will begin to be carried out by hygienists tomorrow and then decide on further action.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of people.
Today, the Oncology Institute in Brno launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which can tell if people have a mask attached at the entrance.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the Prachatice company.
In total, 131 people were infected on Saturday - half of Friday's count - but less is being tested at the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished a fairy tale, swept Anderson
The big surprise of the tournament, called Dimitri van den Bergh, also showed excellent performance in a duel with the player who won the second most prestigious PDC event in 2018.
The beginning of the match was mutually balanced, the turning point came at 8:7 for the Belgian darts player.
Van den Bergh took a 13-arrow Lego and has had the upper hand ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the significantly more experienced "Flying Scots" hardly got to the do-double.
The way the "Dream Creator" in his handman is also evidenced by the fact that the disputed Anderson played his first maximum in August 24.
Plus, the young Belgian handled great high checkouts.
He lost in the 11th leg, but in an unfavorable state he "catched a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson could see a huge frustration.
He threw the arrows rather than throwing away and his triumph walking opponent was absolutely sovereign.
Van den Bergh turned the first of three match donations and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
The trophy, named after Phil Taylor, is all the more valuable to the Belgian darts player that this is his first major won.
The last player who managed to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes charged over cathedral fire, man confesses
St. Peter and Paul's Cathedral in the heart of Nantes began burning last Saturday, and the fire severely damaged the original 16th-century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
Investigators investigated the arsigoring because the fire was advancing through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police at the entrances did not find any signs that someone would get into the cathedral by force.
The accused are a volunteer at the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without proposing.
Now prosecutors have reported that on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessing and facing arson charges.
If he is found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the act and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present a "semaphore" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan, due to the absence of which the government and the Ministry of Health face criticism.
"The steps will be according to the strength of community spread," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange stage.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in individual regions varies significantly, it has added.
The Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual stages, whether it is the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on the Prima Partie TV program, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation deteriorates.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been increasing in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing major is happening to speak of the declaration of the state of emergency or the re-convenment of the crisis staff.
In view of the growing number of infected since Saturday in the whole of the Czech Republic, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear masks at indoor events over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government’s progress, when until the last moment it was unclear what measures and when they would come into force or when they would be announced, came to criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main officials should create a sense of security and straighten the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example, in Prague from Sunday, the obligation to wear masks even in non-residential medical facilities, i.e. in pharmacies or waiting rooms at the doctor's office, is also subject to.
The obligation to wear masks during a visit to health and social care facilities or pharmacies was also introduced in the Liberec and Ústí Regions from Friday.
In the Vysočina region in the Jihlava region it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public areas, in public transport and in medical facilities from 14. July.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as in the Central Bohemian Region in the Kutná Hora region.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which in color distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, authorities from 15. June does not require a negative test for the coronavirus or do not quarantine from Czech citizens.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category.
Technoparty in the Benešov region continues.
Playing for a third capacity, should have ended at noon
Hlaváčková Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty near Hlaváčková Lhota in the Benešov region continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems still play.
According to the evening estimates, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, in the morning there were 900, police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková said.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at that time some of the musical systems actually fell silent.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
Musical production is still ongoing.
We expect that the musical systems will be gradually disconnected and disassembled," Nováková said.
“Police officers are still consistently inspecting departing visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
The event is supervised by dozens of police officers of the riot unit, there are foreign police on the scene, traffic and riot police, and there are also handlers with service dogs on standby.
"During today, police officers have inspected 470 people moving at the venue of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers have been subjected to a breath test, six of whom were behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police for the presence of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, of which one was positive.
Police also dealt with 14 violations in transport.
At the request of the technicians, the police officers carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene there.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said this on the Prima Partie programme.
However, the number of participants decreased below 1000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not needed, nor did the sanitation station or the Ministry of Health ask for it.
Czech Television (ČT) said on Sunday that the technoparty had also spread to the surrounding land, whose owners did not agree to use for technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim damages.
Fans of techno in the meadow near Hlaváček's Lhota arrived on Friday evening.
Police originally guarded the meadow in Blažíma in the Benešov region on Friday, where the technoparty took place last year.
Blažím is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváčková Lhota, where the technicians eventually finally got together.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažem.
The girl ended up in the hospital!
"This year's first case was recorded in the Ironyrudence.
The viper was bitten into the leg by a girl, a year 2010, which the parents themselves brought to the local base of the emergency services," regional spokeswoman for the emergency medical services, told the daily, adding that they then transported the child to a hospital in Klatovy.
The viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in Šumava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
There is no danger from these animals.
The chances of a viper bite you aren't too high, she's afraid of herself in normal contact.
And if she has room for it, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
It only attacks if she feels very threatened - for example, when you accidentally step on it.
Even her bite is not a tragedy, although her poison is very effective against small mammals, but she does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from allergies.
The risk is therefore mainly for children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
"After being bitten, a person often has a nausea feeling, sweats, had an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová of the Klatovy hospital told the daily.
The man threatened to throw the infant out the window.
He poured wine after the policeman and threw dishes
After 23:00, an intervention unit broke into the apartment and arrested the man.
The infants were immediately taken into care by medics, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police officers, threw dishes, knives or poured it out of the window with wine from the police negotiator.
He increased his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed the windowsill where he staggered.
Police are still investigating the man.
He does not want to publish any further information yet.
Stosur will prefer her daughter to the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not be involved in the coronavirus-affected season this year.

The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season on August 3 with a clay tournament in Palermo since March.
Sapa Market: Raid Reveals Meat, Fish and Eggs of Unknown Origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises was transported by 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the rendering enterprise," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the live fish booth, it was then found that the seller did not have proof of the origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered problematic from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
Last autumn, for example, veterinarians uncovered an illegal food store, with almost half a ton of unmarked food without proof of origin.
For most, it was impossible to determine the expiration date, part of the products had an expired shelf life and was spoiled.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the expiry date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians with police officers in the market area detained 80 kilograms of non-deprived food, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin phoned Zelensky before the ceasefire in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is scheduled to begin from midnight.
According to the Kremlin statement, Putin criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelenskyy had called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
Negotiators of Ukraine and Russia agreed on a new peace of arms on Wednesday evening with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is due to begin after midnight on Monday night, it is supposed to be "complete and general" and to open the way to meet other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin told Zelensky in an interview that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections is contrary to a peace agreement from Minsk and threatens the prospects of a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian parliament decided that the forthmissal elections to local councils would not take place in territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kiev will take back under control of the border of Ukrainian lands occupied by separatists with Russia after providing broad autonomy to these regions and holding local elections there.
Zelensky's office said the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass and the need to implement further measures to support the region, such as demining areas of fighting or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimean peninsula and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but in occasional firefights and artillery attacks on both sides of the front, people continue to die.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed more than 14 000 people since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies this.
Zelensky has made his priority from the end of the war in Donbass, but there has not yet been a major breakthrough in the negotiations.
An unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykl, the heptathlon dominated by Novotná
The defending champion of the last two titles Doležal did not finish at the end of Saturday's program four hundred, Kopecký did not jump the base in the pole on Sunday.
The decals were ruled for a long time by the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but he resigned after the disc.
So far, Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor MČR, this time he was the only decathlon player to get past the seven-thousand mark.
Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek won another medal behind him.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a pity that there weren't boys and Kope didn't start because the results would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I had a person about 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was even pleased with the stick and I was most disappointed by the disk, there I was below average," he acknowledged on Facebook.
Kateřina Cachová won the first day of the heptathlon with more than a hundred-point advantage, despite her suffering from an injured ankle on her rebound leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she then wrote down only 570 cm, did not throw 40 meters with a spear and did not enter the final eight-hundred.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
It was mainly far, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630.
Yesterday I started to pull my calf, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all," Novotná said on the Facebook union.
Organic LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied petroleum gas (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its fundamentally lower price compared to petrol or diesel, a significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Similar to gasoline and diesel, it has its ecologically friendly option - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market last year and, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association, arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago.
"These days we received the first fifteen tons of organic LPG, which will be distributed to our petrol stations in a mixture with a classic fossil LPG," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be considered as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, he is chemically identical to the classic oil LPG, which a number of motorists are now refuting into their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference from the classic LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about organic LPG.
This is one of the great advantages of organic LPG over other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and the distribution infrastructure is quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, conventional oil LPG is partly produced as a by-product of oil refining, partly by separation during natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source of the operation of the car on organic LPG, it is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than operating on LPG petroleum and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called. part of "well-to-tank" (in English "from the source to the tank").
One of the largest producers of bio LPG currently include petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also examining the possibility of production in its Litvínov refinery.
According to estimates by the association in the Czech Republic, about 170 thousand vehicles run on LPG; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, about 200 thousand.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, almost 6 thousand conversions of LPG cars were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number fell by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the ministry to revise the number of infected with the coronavirus virus.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number on Sunday afternoon dropped from 5254 on Saturday to 3479 cases, which is 1775 fewer infected.
There are currently 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"The step-swing increase in the number of cured is the revision of data, which has recently not been able to be updated by hygienists," said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people had contracted the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11 419 have recovered and 371 Covid-19 have succumbed.
Mobile electoral units or correspondence elections.
Political scientist and sociologist looking for variants for the time of the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), a change in the law is necessary, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He said this on Sunday in Prima TV.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions to the ministry with representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamacek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the current legal rules.
But the minister said it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine could not vote due to their health.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said on the OVM programme that the possibility of correspondence elections has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the Chamber of Deputies, then envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or the ČSSD (since it would rather record other types of parties) from the correspondence election as overvalued according to experience from abroad.
Personally, it is then against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now it is necessary to think of the mechanisms (elections) that could be realized already this year and with the least possible health risk.
He then considers it the main one to be prepared for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence option (when only abroad or also in the Czech Republic) as one of the functional methods.
Next, he sees the aforementioned electoral units or the possibility of a proxy vote within the family.
He added that there was a chance to learn how similar situations - elections in the time of the coronavirus - were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, various types of elections have already been postponed in 67 countries around the world this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig ears thrown by protesters at the government building
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the "mafia style of governance" that has been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade for Wednesday, the DPA news agency said.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th consecutive day, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Svoboda, had a weaker turnout than the previous one.
As of 20:00, about 300 people gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators in front of the government building played a theatrical scene in which they symbolically locked Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the abolition of the announced health care reform and the end of corruption in the construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organizer Nikolai Hadzigenov said on public radio today that Wednesday is preparing a "top escalation" in the form of a "wide-wide demonstration in Sofia and blockades across the country."
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the call of early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said he was not going to step down.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to implement Bulgaria through the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not calm the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government survived a vote of confidence in parliament in parliament.
Coach Bologna Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Football coach Boloni Siniša Mihajlovič has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes fans to return to the stadiums from the new season.
“What we’re doing here isn’t football.
I'm fed up with matches without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
Those games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks that,” Mihajlovič said before today’s game against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, the series A matches follow in quick succession, and although they are played in the evening, their actors are on the heat.
"We play every three days in the terrible heat.
In such conditions, you can't even tell how the teams are doing.
To end this season.
Those measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back," said the coach, who also led Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlović, this season is also extraordinary because it was missing for four months on the bench due to the treatment of leukemia.
"Over despite my illness, the breaking of the league and everything else, our team managed to move up the level.
We want to keep growing and we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of a cyberattack of foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as also oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials said the fire that erupted this month in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz may have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic faces "thousands of cyberattacks" every day.
He added that this was not a new phenomenon and that most of them could be repelled.
In recent months, according to Musawi, several wider cyberattacks have been recorded, behind which, according to the analysis, have been played by "certain governments and groups".
However, he did not give further details of the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month was that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the U.S., may have been behind recent incidents.
However, neither of these countries was directly charged with specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held hostage to 52 Americans for 444 days.
Long-tened relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the world's powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a tough impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. military on January 3 killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and a member of the leadership of the Iraqi militias Abu Mahdi Muhandis.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate.
The U.S. has only admitted with a distance that dozens of U.S. troops were wounded.
Israel sees Iran as its arch-enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended production shutdown, now until May 25
Cologne-based automaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has re-extended production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
Production lines are expected to start again on Monday, May 25, morning.
Dozens of hygiene measures will be accompanied by the start, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the carmaker.
Production has been based on the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
Originally, the company intended to renew it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the shutdown is closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell the cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. two shifts.
The coronavirus is hit by key markets of the firm, such as Italy, the UK or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said that the production shutdown at TPCA is not reflected in life in the city.
"At first it was obvious, it was empty in the city.
But gradually the street is filling up, especially now from Monday, when it got a lot loose.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in the hostels.
"We didn't have to deal with almost any problem in those two months," Kaspar said.
For example, Mladá Boleslav’s Škoda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed it on Monday 27 April at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the races work 100 percent of capacity.
The resumption of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, a third, night shift took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
Approximately 2500 people currently work at TPCA and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and employers in the Kolín region.
Cancer Kills Bride Shortly After Marriage: Leave a Message to Family
She battled Gemma Sisson for more than two years, and when she seemed to beat the cancer, the disease came again.
The thirty-nine-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a hospice in a hospice, where she still managed to take the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her Facebook account.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, they traveled around the world to compete.
A thirty-nine-year-old woman had sports and lived healthy, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope of healing.
After months of treatment, Gemma actually seemed to have won over the cancer, but in August 2019 the cancer returned and this time the spine attacked.
According to the Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour spinal spine operation and then relaid with drastic treatment.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, at her 39th birthday, doctors told her that she had a few months left to live.
In April, the handsome blonde finally decided to board a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family every now and then, who even gave her a wedding to her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma for the last time on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post that Gema had written for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart that I leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible illness has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky, who was by my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social media, adding that the pain and suffering had finally ceased and she found peace.
"I'm also grateful for all the support I've received from all my followers on the social network," she wrote, adding that everyone should respect their lives and live it to the fullest.
Machines for art sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, passers-by will receive a handheld work of mostly beginning Czech artists.
The images and other creations create directly for the artmat, so they know in advance that they have to fit up to the size of 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Widžová, the project's curator.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
Thus, the buyer can be surprised by what work of art he acquires.
Currently, it can become the new owner of fantastic illustrations Alexandra Štoplová or mini-views from Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutková, prepared a pexeso associated with a walk through Prague.
Cards need to be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packing of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from a tyour and a divination card, the second series of illustrations based on her comics Spiritistka.
Health pay will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
According to Vojtěch, a bigger increase is unrealistic
Health pays could increase by a maximum of five percent next year, said Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Questions of Václav Moravec on Czech Television.
He considers the demand for trade unionists to increase by up to 15 percent to be unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in securing protective equipment.
Hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (salaries) can be somewhere up to five percent," he said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation in which since March it has intervened in the collection of the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations against its spread.
Insurance revenues fell at the time.
"I find an increase unrealistic by 15 percent at the moment," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS) are likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, nurses 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the wages of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The ÚZIS data also show that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
According to data from the Czech Statistical Office, the average wage in the Czech Republic was CZK 34 125 in 2019.
Representatives of the unionist said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally by 15 percent.
They have long criticized the significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be governed by salary tables and contract wages in hospitals of cities, regions or private.
They therefore also demand that the health care tables be uniform for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, for doctors, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should perceive how the state is currently doing.
The Chamber of deputies recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns due to the impact of the Covid outbreak, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the Council of Health Care Providers disagrees with the blanket increase in salaries next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and medical facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel Švagr, Chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical device in the property.
He is awaiting the completion of the selection procedures.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
Scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We are ready, they say
“Smart quarantine works, there’s something to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss the army tonight with the army.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should run the whole thing again," the prime minister said on Sunday in his Facebook show, Zhou People.
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and sanitary stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
According to the Prime Minister, the problems were in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some of the current outbreaks.
Jan Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, told the Czech News Agency that he did not have information about Sunday's hearing and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The Smart Quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a ninety-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body of the government, led by former minister's deputy Roman Prymula.
The scrushing project was criticized by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
He also said that he could be taken over by the army again.
The shortcomings in the project were previously admitted by the government's IT and digitization commissioner Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of him.
"The system is working, but it's still being worked on.
For twenty years it was created independently and unsystematically, now we are trying to unify it within a few months.
It's not a jet.
People on the move, poor people on the hygiene on the move adapt the new systems and actually catch those mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "fool in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort to "not fool around in politics," he told news server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO movement's bureau, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the electoral votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I'd last one term and with the experience of business, I can overturn everything here and get on my feet," he told Respekt.
He added that he allowed himself to be persuaded to some extent for the second term.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in that politics," Macura added, who in an interview called himself a tough introvert who doesn't have frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has long been speculation about Macur's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura criticized the ANO movement several times, for example for an alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few personalities, ANO supported Zeman’s opponent Jiří Drahoš in the elections.
From the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"When I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile struggle and that no one is involved in it, I do not have an immediate motive to end," he said.
Fifty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming the mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura worked as a director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the bodies of other companies.
Uber offering transport services to return to Brno
Uber, which offers transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is the result of a change in the law, Petr Kratochvíl (ODS), the Brno City Councillor for Transport, said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as labels such as a taxi or taximeter.
However, the change in the law has changed from July the conditions for the operation of both ordinary taxis and alternative ones.
Kratochvíl has held several discussions with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"On the basis of this basis, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to legally operate.
The city was acquainted with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber has worked in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not marking vehicles as a taxi or missing taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction that banned Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but last year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to keep Uber operating in Brno.
According to later decisions of the courts, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
He will now return on the basis of a change in the law.
From July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair hit a meter from a person on the sidewalk
An office chair flew out of the fourth floor of the apartment building on Saturday evening in Brno and fell about a meter away from the pavement.
A pedestrian was after him at the time, who immediately called the officers.
Immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which a chair was still lying, and a few cans and butts next to it.
"The bustle, which was carried from the room on the fourth floor, indicated that a relatively noisy celebration was taking place inside.
Officers went up the hall to the apartment and asked three young men present, aged from twenty-six to the age of twenty-nine, to explain," police spokesman Jakub Ghanem said.
Requirement to dismiss Rafaj will be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday a request for a proposal to dismiss the head of the antitrust office (ÚOHS) Petr Rafaj.
The non-profit organizations called for the dismissal of Rafaj at the meeting of the anti-corruption council of the government and also the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats say the exchange at the head of the office is appropriate.
According to the Czech News Agency, Rafaj was not invited to the Cabinet Office on Monday.
The second mandate will end in the middle of next year, according to the law he cannot be appointed for the third time.
His dismissal is in the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the call of non-profit organizations, the prime minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason for this is, among other things, to Raha's recent cases.
In the past week, the prime minister declined to comment on the demand, saying that he would get acquainted with the materials and the governing parties will take a "someone's position".
He also said he had not yet discussed the calls with the president, he has not had a meeting with him in the near future.
According to the Office's statement, there is no reason to appeal because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
News server IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz wrote in the past week that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with Governor Jiří Čunek.
The meetings were linked, among other things, to the decision on the competition for the project of the controversial new Zlín hospital for eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard for.
Cunek admitted the meetings, according to him, they jointly dealt with his "senate activities".
Rafaj speaks the same way.
The Ústí nad Labem Region Council called on the government to dismiss Rafaj at the end of June.
It also seeks to reform the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
According to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek, the decision of the Office on Public Procurement is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, police intervened at the antitrust office over a toll withdrawal tender.
In June this year, news server Aktuálně.cz reported that Rafaj uses apartments written on the company of the influential behind-scene ČSSD player Alexander Čuba.
However, the deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj’s account.
The Chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition is Rafaj from 9. July 2009, for the second term of office, the former Social Democrat member was appointed by the former Social Democrat member in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second-year term expires.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the President may remove the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it does not perform a function for more than six months, or seriously undermines the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
Employees collapsed in the Blansko library with heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"This is good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blansko regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stand there.
It was very hot and bad air.
Ventilation didn't help.
That's why I'm glad for the air conditioning," said one of the Blansko readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Dlapa, the temperatures in the building often climbed up to thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and on sunny days it functions as a greenhouse.
"In addition, the sun is leaning into it for a large part of the day, thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate the individual departments, because overnight the windows must be closed for security reasons.
We often have thirty degrees in the library since morning," Dlapa said.
The worst part was the study room and the reading room on the third floor.
And a floor up, then the exhibition rooms and the principal's office.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's ward, located under the roof of the building.
"It happened several times that librarians collapsed at work and ended up in incapacity for work.
The problem was also regularly in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe," Dlapa remarked.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of limited funding, air conditioning will have only the most troublesome space.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department above," informed Jiří Svoboda from the Blansko Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase, the workers installed air conditioning in the mentioned premises last autumn and modified the wiring.
Approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of these, it is about nine hundred in fifteen years.
Chicago's support has been driven out by the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who are silent about the health of the players as a grave and publishes nothing at all.
He was one of the few who got out of the Crawford line.
The thirty-five-year-old native of Montreal was only present at the first training session, since then he has been absent from the line-up.
"I would like to inform all of you that I have tested positive for Covid-19 and because of this I have spent the last fortnight locked up in my home," he revealed the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself into full load again.
“It’s amazing that I’m back.
I'll do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goaltender won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goalie is for his tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks awaits first preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they'll face Edmonton in the pre-round.
Thousands protest in Israel against PM
Thousands of Israelis have protested in several places the country has protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is addressing the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place, among other things, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in the city of Caesarea, near its official residence or in a park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been held regularly for weeks.
Their participants are calling for Netanyahu's resignation over a process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as over the government's handling of another wave of the coronavirus outbreak.
"Bibi, go home," one protester wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's generally known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes," said another.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is the first prime minister of Israel to be in office.
He is charged in three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He denies all the accusations and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, over 300 witnesses are summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has confirmed nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has about nine million people.
455 people have died in connection with the outbreak.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures to help reduce daily increases in the infected.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, especially at the end of June, the number of infected people began to rise significantly again.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, tradespeople affected by quarantine measures.
Protesters are also bothered by the fact that the government is issuing conflicting instructions in the context of the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and died.
Firefighters had to cut the body out of the wreck
The tragic accident happened around 23 o'clock near Neveklov in a narrow district leading from the Slapy dam.
The driver apparently flew down to the forest at a considerable speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died at the scene.
The body had to be rescued from the wreckage by firefighters, among other things, they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are being investigated by police officers.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which should, among other things, clarify whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
The end with wasting and spewing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and embarks on a fundamental change in strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to chute one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of clothing rolls end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, often despised approach to dressing, has changed quite quickly over the last few years.
About half of the goods were sold by Pietro Filipi at full price.
The other half that was sold thanks to discounts is not so easy to buy.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and at the end of each season to discount products below their production price.
In addition, according to owner Michal Mička, the days of new and old collections and blind follow the rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most traders count on discounts when buying goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
It’s actually a bit of a scam,” says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support the local business with its approach.
"Each of our product is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and above-season.
Globally, the premium brand segment is typical of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti is represented by RAF aviator Kurta Taussiga
"The assignment was to create something to mark the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal was enjoyed by the city leadership," said Vacek, who completed his work after a fortnight of intensive work.
It consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig made his way to the UK, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then underwent pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He joined combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, who is known to people in the field of street graphic art by the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in the streets of Teplice for more than 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the surfaces set aside for these purposes by the then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna arrives at Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST last night) arrived on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas.
He hit the Texas island of Padre Island, roughly 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and weakened into a tropical storm as he moved over the mainland.
However, according to meteorologists, it poses a great danger to coastal residents.
Heavy winds and intense rainfall have brought with it; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwestern Texas on Saturday and recommended voluntary evacuation to people.
The strongest warnings were given to people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay Bay, but in total the element is supposed to hit nearly 500 kilometers long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"While Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes pose a threat," the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning, local time (after afternoon CEST), the storm was moving in the U.S.-Mexico border area, accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region on Saturday.
Above the Gulf of Mexico, she was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour when it progressed to the mainland, which knocked Hanna out of the category of hurricanes again.
Authorities have urged local residents to survive the storm at home, not forgetting hygiene measures related to the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of those U.S. states that plague the covid-19 pandemic the most.
Due to the current security measures and the need to comply with distances, possible evacuations are also a big challenge.
Makeshift shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas district of Hidalgo, one of the buildings was also adapted as evacuated shelter who tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities urged all evacuees to take masks and disinfectants gels with them to the shelter if possible.
"We're not even behind it yet.
We're expecting catastrophic flooding," Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville, was quoted as saying by the AP.
Forecasts say that in some places it could rain up to 300 millimeters of rain in a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimeters, which, together with the surge of sea level, could flood a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman lends general rank to Colonel Lipka
President Miloš Zeman will lend the general rank of Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
This is according to an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for lending the rank of brigadier general is the August accession of Lipka to the post of deputy commander of the Alliance's multinational division northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The promotion to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
Since the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as deputy commander of the multinational division of the northeast in Elblag, Poland, which commands the units of the alliance forwarded presence on the territory of Poland and the Baltics.
In March, Řehka became the director of the National Cyber and Information Security Authority (NÚKIB).
The government has proposed to the president that he lends Lipko the rank of brigadier general.
Under the Act on Professional Soldiers, a higher rank may be bestowed on the soldier for the duration of the elected office or for the period of performance of the service task, which requires the granting of a higher rank.
The post of deputy commander of the alliance division corresponds to the rank of general.
The soldier to whom the rank was granted has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to an adjustment of the salary that corresponds to the given rank.
The lending of the rank takes the waiver of the reason for which it was granted to him.
"Ligar colonel shows high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
It significantly participates in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defense said in June on the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 a.m. at Prague Castle, which will be attended by the Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or the Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the observance of distance or wearing masks on both the plane and the airport, but the middle seats on the planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport added that the agreement was concluded by officials and that it has yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The measures agreed include the requirement to cover your mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must also be plenty of fresh air on planes and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common provisions agreed by officials shall satisfy at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards were caused by confusion.
On the Arctic Svalbard, the temperature record was set, they measured almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has been set in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the early evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
The roughly two-thousand-strong Longyearbyen is the largest city in Svalbard, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbards are heated faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report from the Norwegian Climate Center last year.
According to him, the average temperature at Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 70's of the 20th century.
By 2100, it could rise by even ten degrees if the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is not reduced.
Temperature growth can result in melting eternally frozen soil in Svalbards, which will jeopardize the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause even more avaluators and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, which are dependent on ocean ice sheet.
Britons returning from Spain awaits mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet has also urged citizens to avoid all travels to mainland Spain that are not necessary because of the risk of spreading covid-19.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to go into isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
“Private is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," British diplomacy said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will remove a certain country immediately from the list of safe ones," she added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, the British are concerned whether they will be paid sick leave if they will have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from the holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from the city of Sittingbourne booked a ten-day holiday on Lanzarote, they were due to leave on Tuesday.
The trip has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go to the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a train driver and I don’t think my employer will accept that I will be in quarantine for two weeks after returning from vacation,” Hunter said.
In the context of Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, more than 900 new infections have been added in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia trying to curtail all nightlife and prevent people from meeting in a large scale.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has newly highlighted the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The model of electricity purchase from Dukovany will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss the model of the purchase of electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill envisages that if the feed-in price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the feed-in price will be lower than the price on the market, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the CEZ energy company have previously said that the more likely option is that people will save money thanks to the construction of electricity.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as developments have shown several times in the past.
Environmental organizations have previously criticized the project.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of applause of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact is spread among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - at lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT) said in the material documents.
Havlíček said in May that he expects that the wholesale price of electricity will rise and people will make a profit on the construction of Dukovany.
Otherwise, the impact in the tens of crowns per year will be per family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay annually in electricity bills to support so-called supported sources.
He had previously estimated that the feed-in tariff could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal of the sums, it should be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, to which traders are now most stocked, currently is around 45 euros (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
"With the difference in the feed-in price and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, the surcharge of the average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to a four-member household, standard equipped with electrical appliances including an electric hob and an oven, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and hot water - less than 100 CZK/year," it wrote in the documents for the government of the Ministry of the Ministry.
“We live in a very turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be an explicitly speculative issue," Tomáš Voltr, executive director of the Energy financial group's investment group, told the Czech News Agency.
The proposed law foresees that the purchase would be carried out by the Ministry of Industry and so on behalf of the law firm by the State at a predetermined price.
A contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but no longer than the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon design design defines as an electricity generating plant with a nuclear reactor connected to the electricity system with an installed capacity of a minimum 100 megawatt (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovany unit should have an output of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to the tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block is expected to be operational in 2036.
The model of financing of the new Dukovany bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The state should finance the facility during construction without interest, during operation, with two percent interest is expected.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, it is also bothered by the possibility that Dukovany would be built by Russian or Chinese firms.
The state should contribute 70% in the construction.
The rest should be paid by CEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
ČEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told the Czech News Agency in May that the expected sum for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and CEZ on the construction of the new Dukovany bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
Ministry for Regional Development withdraws material on support of tourism in the media for two billion
The case withdrew the material according to which the Ministry of Regional Development (MoRD (MoRD) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on vacation in the Czech Republic, was withdrawn by the authority from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) told SeznamZprávy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was brought to the attention of the Zdopravy.cz server on Friday.
The ministry justified the plan by a slump in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also saw a drop in revenue.
The proposal has sparked criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidactstatu.cz, the Ministry of the Interior planned to give money through the state agency for tourism support CzechTourism for advertising in television, radio, press, on the Internet, billboards or areas at railway stations.
The largest share of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
Most of them would be won by private broadcasters Nova and Prima.
Printed diaries and weeklies would receive $400 million, and the same part would be given by the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would get 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would be privately more.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at railway stations or in the metro.
The campaign to support tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," Dostálová said without further details to SeznamMess.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) would profit from advertising.
"I firmly believe that this ostentatious contempt will get a blow between the eyes in the autumn of the election," she tweeted.
Dostálová denies that it is in fact a help to the media affected by the crisis.
"It may be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she told the N daily on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we're still counting it, it could be less or more.
It's a working material," she added.
The Saving Tourism Initiative makes no sense to support domestic tourism.
"We do two billion for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, chairman of the initiative on Sunday.
If there are those two billion crowns in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not to the media, writes the initiative in an open letter to the government.
Broth of life, cocoon beers and death like a blade of grass
Posthumous is also the third album titled A Death is the blade of the Brno poet, tiring organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Frič’s discography, he is the fifth item and, as with previous titles, the main emphasis is on Frič’s poetry, of which he is himself an excellent interpreter.
Frič, the 1949 year, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but he passed this inspiration through his own, distinctively presented experiences and also very intrinsic expressions of faith.
But he was far from agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, utterly tolerant.
In this context, I can think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček), the masters will forgive.
Frič’s album offers recordings of the author’s reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who always accompanied it very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help - gladly - in the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetry compositions.
"They radiated a proud and endless bitterness," writes Hruška, "above the state of our world threatened by extinction.
A world that is increasingly sinking into numb consumerism and greed, is increasingly moving away from what its soul was created from - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was a desire in them who knows that the values for which he was created few interested, but who also knows that it is only for the sake of universal disinterest they cannot be renouncing.
Those poems reminded you that a person might have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how he loses it.
Whether he sells himself to the general decline, he resigns skeptically, falls silent, or stays silent until the last moment in a calm and proud of what he believes and loves.”
Paroubek is not my advisor, Hamacek said
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to the Social Democrats.
Party Chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamacek said this on the Prima Partie TV program today.
The news server SeznamZprávy.cz reported that Paroubek should be Hamáček’s advisor on Friday.
"From time to time we write a text message, he sometimes sends me some material and I will read it," Hamacek said today.
He added that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the CSSD does not have the means to waste them on similar purposes.
"There are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "disgustingly listen to the opinions of Václav Klaus".
According to him, it is okay, because it is an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
The fact that the media is making an affair out of it was a sign of this year's cucumber season.
The server SeznamZprávy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek was fulfilling the role of Hamáček’s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is connected with Paroubek, was heading to the fourth place of the party’s candidate in the Ústí nad Labem region and served as the vice-chairman of his LEV 21 party.
Hamacek said today that he would not comment on the composition of the candidate until it is finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, laments Swede's challenger
The 22-year-old American pole vaulter has ambitions and the potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it is like to beat Duplantis two years younger, last year he was defeated at a meeting of the NCAA universities association.
"We had a battle a year before, he won then and I was second, then we switched it.
In both cases, it was a very good duel," says Nilsen, who secured his victory with a 5.95-meter victory.
But Duplantis has shot steeply up since, and is currently alone in the highest pole vaulting spheres.
At the age of twenty, he became a world record holder, this year 8. February in Torun surpassed the bar of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow added a centimeter.
"He was jumping six meters as early as 18, when he graduated from high school," his peer Nilsen recalled for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that as soon as he came to a man, he would multiply all his potential and talent here.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record," he said.
Although Nilsen's list of achievements is noticeably thinner than the one that Duplantis prides itself, the American sets similar goals.
So far, he has indicated his options at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, improving his internal personal best to 5.93 m in February this year. Last August, he won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he made his mark for the U.S. World Championship, where he finished 13.
The closest milestone for him is for the first time to taste the Diamond League.
"It's definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because that's where you can make a name," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events such as the Olympic Games, the World Championships or the Pan-American Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under the five rings into a mere battle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don't think it's possible in the near future," Nilsen said.
"The boy has been jumping for 16 years and has a mi-head start over everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, it will want to increase it.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands of her disabled son's disability pension.
She's going to have a trial
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily for improving the quality of his life.
The woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to ill health, the court stripped the sick man of legal capacity and appointed his mother with a guardian who was supposed to manage his son's money, among other things.
"The woman from mid-Noph 17 2013 to this January used a part of the funds from the invalidity pension of the son for her own use and deprived him of 440 thousand crowns," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said, adding that the accused woman was obliged to defend the interests of the injured party as a guardian.
The woman, according to the court's instruction, set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the stay of her son in the medical facility and the reimbursement of the necessary drugs, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of the vehicle, electrical appliances and for the operation of the household," the indictment reads.
That she can't use her son's money for her own needs, the woman admitted.
However, she defended herself by helping them out paying family expenses.
“We had trouble tightening the household’s running out of our income.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things whose purchase the son would have approved.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30 000 years, scientists say after the discovery of tools
Findings from the Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could be used to slice meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spearheads or spears.
The researchers found that the oldest of the tools date from 33 000 to 31 000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of the two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12 500 years.
According to experts, people inhabited the Chiquihuite Cave, located at a high altitude of 20 000 years.
The previously widely recognized theory has said that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13 500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spikes used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, have shown that this mayoral culture subsequently spread in much of North America.
But this model has been rift in recent decades when several ancient settlements have been discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
In the second study published in the journal Nature, 42 different locations across North America are reported to human presence on the continent between 26 000 and 19 000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have come to the North American mainland before it was thought.
Some could have made it to America by boat.
"Obviously, people were in America long before the development of the so-called mayor culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Canada.
Interest in airfare so far has been fulfilled by an optimistic scenario, sellers say.
Prices are gradually decimated
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still about half, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to the sellers, the development after the crisis is fulfilling the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually decimated.
According to sellers, South European countries are among the most popular destinations.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece are leading.
Flights to Split, Croatia, is the most sold at the Letuška.cz portal.
Among other countries, the UK is the most sought-after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average price of tickets is also decreasing.
At the Letuška.cz portal, it was around 6250 crowns in the middle of the month, 3000 crowns less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now accounts for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices themselves are also falling to some European places, such as Spain or Italy, in the past few weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets much less in advance than before, because they are worried about the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier Kiwi.com, the time of purchase of the ticket before departure decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms to us the future trend, when people will order tickets much less in advance, they will require more flexibility, less risk," said Michal Šindelář, vice president for Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with sales growth, the number of renewed flights from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
There are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations at Prague Airport.
Compared to last summer, this is about half of the destinations.
Grand Finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization reached the grand final.
It will feature the experienced forty-nine-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, the twenty-six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pipa in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the table chart.
Even with James Wad, however, he had a good deal with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one in the quarterfinals.
"Flying Scottish" was almost in the semifinals, when he faced Michale Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel, dominated the overtime and after the result of 18:16 he won the place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated already in 2018, when in an amazing battle he defeated Mensur Suljovic 21:19.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and maybe the awareness that has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The twenty-six-year-old darts player initially knocked out Nathan Aspinall's world number six, pushing Joo Cullen in a dramatic battle, and in the quarterfinals after a sharp start he defeated Adrian Lewis.
The big test was the semi-final.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the beginning, but the calmly playing Belgian then gained a great streak of the lead, which he then more or less without any problems kept until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high-scoring, which came across the occasional uncertainty of doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15 212 people have been infected with it.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, there are 5 254 people sick.
This is according to data on the Ministry of Health website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded two hundred in a row.
There were 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday, there were 235 tested, a day earlier 246 and on Tuesday 206.
In the first working day of this week, there were 169 people infected.
Of the covid-19, 9 590 people have already been cured in the Czech Republic, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
Most of the disease had a mild course.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with the coronavirus in the hospital, the condition of 19 of them is assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days per 100,000 inhabitants still show Karviná, almost 59.
This is followed by the Jihlava district with 56 and Frýdek-Místek with 36 infected per 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People have to wear masks at indoor mass events over 100 people, these are cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited from the current thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been proven to have contracted the new coronavirus has already exceeded the limit of 16 million.
This was stated by the American Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
The death toll from the covid-19 death to the covid-19, according to the source, is close to 645 thousand.
The latest million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell 22. July.
The United States has had the largest share of rapid growth in the number of cases in recent days, which already registers over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, according to authorities.
The number of people infected is now increasing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization announced this week that there had been more than 284 thousand new cases worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the peak in populous states such as the US, Brazil or India, but the number of new cases has grown in nearly 40 countries around the world in the past week.

The air in the home is up to five times worse than outdoors.
Health is harmful to air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality outdoors, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, as quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who has contributed to the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on household pollutants right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the U.S. Environmental Agency (EPA), which said the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than the outdoor one.
The World Health Organization (WHO) believes 3.8 million people die prematurely every year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus outbreak, which has forced a lot and still forces work from home, people have to spend more hours in homes than before, so it's time to focus on household air quality," she said.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one deals with the quality of "home air".
Dangerous can be things that a person normally comes into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poisonous gas is also issued by clothes that we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," Abraham said.
According to her, children, elderly household members and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Otherly, healthy individuals may start to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal thaw, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, the internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
However, not all pollutants come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.

After all, ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where the new era of their relationship began, because Dad then regularly invited Mr. Havel to his home in Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
