Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, and Skoda also scored
Defender Filip Novák helped the final goal in the final round of the Turkish Football League Trabzonspor to the title of vice-captain.
His team won 2-1 at Kayserispor to hold off in third place, keeping third-placed Besiktas behind.
After a January transfer from Slavia, striker Milan Škoda scored his tenth goal for Rizespor, who was saved, despite succumbing to 1-3 at Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed the defender's excellent productivity with his seventh goal of the year.
In the 63rd minute, Kayserispor's goalkeeper just knocked out a fierce shot and the Czech footballer fed the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side managed to equalise five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor, in the sixth minute of the set-up, tore down the victory to his side by successfully finishing a four-on-one break.
Škoda, in the lead-up to the second half of the match with Fenerbahce, he levelled the solo at 1-1.
Rizespor did not hold the indecisive state for a long time, but it did not have to be annoyed, as the results of the opponents left behind three points over the relegation zone.
The competition will conclude with Sunday's championship Basaksehir duel at Kasimpasa.
A well-behidden Cave at the hermit in the woods near Novy Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Novy Bor in Českolipsk, in the forests through which the Count's Road led, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and man-made.
And we will follow that human hand created.
The place is called the Cave at the Hero.
In fact, however, no hermit lived here before, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely the shelter chamber of the crop.
The cave is carved from the side into the rocky spur and accessible by stairs from above.
At the same time, however, it is practically invisible to the last moment.
It will be revealed by the narrow stairs leading to a kind of rock gallery from which it is yet to enter the rock.
Although the chamber seems to be far from human dwellings, there could have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
"The fact that the object has no window and even in the traditional place of the furnace is clearly proving that no hermit here could have ever survived the winter," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-dimensioned building has only a stone bench in the rear, apparently used to put away containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are signs of tools on the cave's walls.
The sandstone break-off was quite simple and quick for the insider.
It was enough to make appropriate use of the cracklings and gradually break off the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the tip of the canine and the mowing method at all, the period of the cave's origin can be defined.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, according to the mess that appears in it, there in today's times someone sometimes sleeps.
If you approach a cave from above from one of the forest paths and you will be intrigued by the cave of a flowing stream and a nearby Count's Road, then the path down will be sure to be found as well.
And on the way out of the forest, you might still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rock.
Joach Minařík is in artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Filip is in the best hands now.
The institute is set up for such cases, plus we have a part of the family in Hanover.
This significantly eases the situation and also to care for my daughter Finja," Jezdci.cz quoted Minaříkov's wife Katji as saying.
"Everyone does their best, Phil now takes time to convalescence.
There's no point in giving any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of the trauma of the head and the patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We must all be patient now and give him time," said the woman of the 45-year-old jockey.
The injured Minar's financially was also appealed in for financial support by star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh King George and Queen Elizabeth Stakes race in Ascot on Saturday, equalising the matching Legend Lester Piggott.
The Gofundme server raised almost €70,000 to date.
The target is an amount of €100,000 ($2.6 million).
Video referee took Sassuoo's four goals, losing 0-2
Sassuolo's players got the ball four times in Saturday's game in Napoli's match, but they eventually had to accept a 0-2 defeat.
Neither of their goals was disposed of by the referee after consulting the video for offside.
According to Italian media, these are record-breaking inclement technologies, so many hits have never been marred by VAR to one team.
"VAR was stricter at Sassuolo than the roadside radar and punished him as a team.
The new technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"Festival of unrecognized goals by Sassuolo.
VAR has never been so strict for one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to have equalised.
Filip Djuričic's goal, however, was not conceded after the video referee's intervention due to offside.
For the same reason, the other Duričič's intervention and hits by Francesco Caput and Domenico Berardi did not apply.
The home side, on the other hand, added one more goal.
Electric cars are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they recharged the most in history
"The growth was driven by both a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš Chmelík, head of the clean technologies department of ČEZ.
Other big players are also bidding for their share on the market, such as PRE and E.ON, electric car maker Tesla, as well as supermarkets Billa and Lidl.
The operators of classic petrol stations are represented by MOL.
But it doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started to build our electromobility network only last year," explained company spokesperson Jana Jusková.
However, the editors of the Daily exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
They show that drivers removed 13.5 kWh on average from the stations.
This is equivalent to the range of roughly 100 kilometres of a smaller electric car.
Aside from the small pumping of up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling was then done in a free tariff.
If motorists were already paying for the collection, their typical spend was around CZK 330.
Electromobility is mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague there are all five of the busiest chargers of ČEZ, which will be eclipsed by the entire regional cities with their popularity.
Olomouc leads the region.
Conversely, the least interest is in remote stations in the borderlands, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
There are currently more than four thousand electric cars registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, there were 1274 new e-authors.
In a large poll of the Daily "Czechs on the Move," eight percent of readers said they were considering purchasing an electric car for the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their surroundings.
Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to the organizers, the government's actions so far in the issues of protecting and repairing the Czech landscape and addressing the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more vigorous approach.
The last drop event was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people here who have been appearing against the expansion at the Turów mine for a long time, there are people who speak out against the mining of gravel in Uherský Ostroh, there are people who speak out against the construction of senseless dams," said Marika Volfová, on behalf of the organizers.
It said the main demands of the protesters were to create a plan to retain water in the countryside, a sweeping change to agricultural policy and a subsidy system to support sustainable agriculture and to switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as soon as possible.
"The government is supposed to defend people's interests, not ruthless and devastating business," she said.
A stand was placed in Malostranske Square with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech state to work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore Czech land and landscapes.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End the Depression of Rape" or "Girl of Coal, More Cowboops."
Jan Škoda came from South Moravia to Prague from the association For Water for People, which is protesting against the gravel mining plan in Hodonín.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the drilling was the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned extraction of gravel, according to him, is only located about 500 metres from the boreholes and, according to the reports, it is certain that the water quality will be at risk.
The so-called agroecological farmer came from the village of Valeč in Karlovy Vary, Vojtěch Veselý.
He drew attention to the pros of small farms, which are not eaten up for yields and profits and supply residents on the spot.
"The small agroecological farms are able to feed the entire population quite normally, on top of that they will not make such a destruction for the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
The plane crashed at a house in Germany, three people died
Three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft at an apartment building in West Germany today and two more were injured.
This was reported by local rescue services, according to which the dead are probably two crew members and one resident of the house.
The aircraft crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The lodging apartment, which was one of the five housing units in the house, was subsequently engulfed in the fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Deputy local fire chief Robert Meyboom said the two crew members of the aircraft had apparently died.
The third victim, according to police, is the woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) newspaper, citing the mayor of Wesel, wrote that he was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which was presumably used as a batch brake.
Police are assuming it came from a crashed plane.
The aircraft had room for two people.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, reported that the plane collided with a hot-air balloon before the collapse.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
The WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft disintegrated in the air before landing on the ground.
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
The error has already been removed
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments to its clients on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank's spokesman, Lukáš Kropík, the problem may have been related to thousands of transactions.
The mistake had already been removed by the savings bank and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with double billing of card payments were noted by Sparkasse Kov.
"We made an update to the system yesterday (Saturday) last night and returned all these double payments to clients immediately.
At the moment, everything is working without any problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients the bank deducted twice from the card payments is unknown to the bank's spokesman, who estimated that there were fewer thousands of transactions.
The causes of the problems are being investigated by the savings bank.
"It could have been a combination of multiple factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.
Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency stages against coronavirus on Monday
"The escalators will be at regional level, according to the strength of the community spread.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch told TIME.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red in colour according to the risk of the occurrence of the coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still discuss the inclusion of individual regions with epidemiologists.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian Region would now have an orange colour and Prague would be approaching.
The map will also feature individual measures for regional sanitation stations, hospitals, sanitary facilities and employers.
"We want to address this at the regional level because the situation in them is not uniform," said Vojtěch.
Vodník and Karolínka
When the water sprite Jonah and the miller's daughter, Caroline, fall for each other, they're not at all easy.
Jonah is being cobbled by his father, the rude water sprite Hastrbuch, Caroline has no idea that her beloved Jonah is not a man.
It's a good thing the youngster Libor is here, who will do everything he can to make sure the whole village, and especially Caroline, protected from the water villain.
What does it matter that he's plotting and lying?
Especially when she can make Caroline reject Jonah and prefer him, the brass Libor.
Before long, it is clear to everyone in the village who is to blame for the drowning of the ponocky Konvička, the rotten flour, the fire of the mill and other charter.
Angry villagers will stage a hunt for a water sprite, and on top of that, Jonah's head will be hit by an implacable water curse.
And now Konvička's soul, Karolínka, rag!
How to soften up old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah, and free him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 at the Czech Television studios and in the exteriors at the Brzina Pond, the Obděnice in Sedlčansk and in the beautiful setting of the historical mill in Hoslovice.

The course of the disease of the majority is mild, with only three percent of those infected having to go to the hospital
Either the more moderate form of the coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or our summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Hospital infectious wards are half-empty, even as the numbers of those infected are growing.
"The situation is quite different today and in April and this is mainly due to the number of hospitalized patients," confirms Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic was at its peak, everyone was wearing the drapes, the samples were carried out by the army, the republic was closed and the Czechs used disinfection for the year ahead.
Yet ten people a day were dying.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with a covid-17 the most people die.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected people, Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the focus at the local Alzheimercentre, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by the hygienists in Černožice in Hradec Králové.
The disease was confirmed by tests at one of the nurses.
"We are traimating, we have restricted movement, we have all sanitary measures," says the director of the retirement home, Martin Scháněl.
According to him, none of the clients of the home has symptoms of the disease yet.
Flat testing will be carried out by the health insurers tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will tell if people have a mask on their way in the entrance.
The record is reported by South Bohemian health officials, who have recorded 25 cases of coronavirus - most of them made up of foreign employees of the dust company.
Overall, there were 131 infections for Saturday - or half of Friday's number - less tested on the weekend.
Debutant Champion!
Van den Bergh rewrites a fairy tale, swept Anderson away
The big surprise of the tournament called Dimitri van den Bergh also produced an outstanding performance in a duel with the player, who won the second most prestigious PDC business in 2018.
The opening of the match was mutually balanced, with a breakthrough coming at 8-7 for the Belgian darth.
Van den Bergh took a breakaway with a 13-wheat legneer and has had the upper hand ever since.
He was literally crushing his opponent with his play, and the significantly more experienced "Flying Scotsman" was hard to get to the doubles.
The way the "Dreammaster" had it in his hand is also evidenced by the fact that the distracted Anderson did not play his first best until the 24th Lego.
Plus, the young Belgian handled the high-level checkouts.
He last lost in the eleventh league, but in an unfavourable state he "caught a large fish" and closed down 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson was a huge frustration.
The darts were more likely to be thrown away, and his pursuit of the triumph of the stepping opponent was in a perfectly sutible manner.
Van den Bergh converted the first of three matches of the dart and lived up to his name - writing his big dream.
The trophy's profit, named after Phil Taylor, is all the more valuable to the Belgian dart-walker as his first-ever major to win.
It remains so that the last player to beat van Day Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
Nantes charges dropped over cathedral fire, man pleases
St. Peter and Paul's Cathedral in the Heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday, and the fire severely damaged the original 16th-century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
The arson suspicions were examined by investigators for the fact that the fire was advancing through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police at the entrances found no sign of anyone getting into the cathedral by force.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without committing a prosecution.
Now the prosecution has reported that, based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, pleaded guilty to the arson charge.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a heavy fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce a "semaphor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to play the role of a pandemic plan, the absence of which the government and the Ministry of Health face criticism.
"The escalators will be according to the strength of the community spread," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a central, orange stage.
The system is designed as a regional one, as the situation in the different regions differs significantly, he added.
The ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) on the system.
According to the minister, specific measures will be attached to the individual grades, be it the obligation to wear masks or the organisation of special departments in hospitals.
The creation of an epidemiological plan on the Prima Partie television programme was called for by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation deteriorates.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalizations remains low.
Vojtěch commented on the fact that nothing major is happening is not appropriate to talk about declaring an emergency or re-conciling of the emergency staff.
In view of the growing number of infections in the Czech Republic, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear masks at indoor events over 100 people in view of the growing number of people in the Czech Republic.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now at 1,000 people.
The government's action, when it was not clear until the last minute, what measures and when they would come into force or when they would be announced, came to be criticised.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main factors should, on the contrary, create a sense of security and, on the contrary, level that mess," Senator Marek Hilšer said in the Questions.
Measures may already be different by region, for example in Prague from Sunday the obligation to wear masks in discharges also in non-apartment medical facilities, such as pharmacies or in the waiting rooms at the doctor's.
They were also introduced to the obligation to wear masks during a visit to health and social facilities or pharmacies in the Liberec and Ústí regions from Friday.
In the Highlands in Jihlava it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public areas, in public transport and in health facilities from 14. July.
In contrast, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, the anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutnohorsko.
Already at the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which colour differentiates the level of contention of the disease in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry to the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, authorities from 15 June, they do not require a negative test for the coronavirus for Czech citizens or are not ordering a quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU members are now in the low-risk category.
Technoparty in Benešov continues.
Playing at a one-third capacity, it was supposed to end at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty at Hlaváčkovy Lhota in Benešov continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems are still playing.
According to evening police estimates, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original rough estimates were three hundred, the morning was at 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the techno-party was supposed to finish on Sunday at noon, at which time it actually subsided some of the music systems.
"Some have already left, and others are about to leave.
Music production is still partly in the process of continuing.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and dismantling of the music systems," Nováková said.
"Police officers are still rigorously checking departing visitors to prevent drivers under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
Dozens of riot police officers are supervising the action, the Alien Police, Traffic and riot police are on site, and there are also on-call for dog men with service dogs.
"During today, officers inspected 470 people moving at the event venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were breath tested, six of whom got behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, of which one was positive.
Officers also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the techno-party participants, officers performed 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants were not reduced, the police would intervene.
On the TV programme Prima Partie, Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said so.
But the number of participants has decreased below 1, so the police assessed that the intervention was not needed, nor was requested by the sanitation station or the Ministry of Health.
Czech Television (ČT) reported on Sunday that the techno-party had also been extended to the surrounding land, the owners of which did not agree to use for the techno-party.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will seek compensation.
Supporters of the techno came to the meadow at Hlaváčkovy Lhota on Friday evening.
Police initially guarded the meadow in Blaimi, Benešov, where the techno-party took place last year, on Friday.
Blažim is located roughly 30 kilometers from Hlaváček's Lhota, where the technologists actually descended.
According to Novak, no one came to Blaim.
Bee bites: Little girl ended up in the hospital!
"This year's first case was recorded in Železnorudsko.
The viper bit into the leg there, the 2010 class of 2010, which the parents themselves brought to the base of the emergency services there," the Regional spokesperson for the emergency medical services, Mária Svobodová, told the daily, noting that the child was then taken to the hospital in Klatovy.
The viper is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in Šumava that these animals are found in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful during walks.
But there is no great danger from these animals.
The chances of the viper biting you aren't too high, they're afraid in normal contact.
And if she has room to do it, she likes to crawl away for loud hissing.
They only attack if they feel very threatened - for example, when you mistakely step on it.
Her bite isn't a tragedy either, but her venom is very effective against small mammals, but it doesn't kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from an allergy.
The risk of danger is therefore primarily in children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"After being bitten, one often feels nauseous, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirsty, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergists, it can occur up to anaphylactic shock," Miriam Gred of Klatovy Hospital described to the Journal.
The man threatened to throw the infant out-of-cover window.
After the policewoman, he poured wine and threw dishes
After 11 p.m., a SWAT team entered the apartment and detained the man.
The infant was immediately taken into care by paramedics, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the officers, throwing dishes, knives or dousing her with wine from the window at the police negotiator.
He amplified his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once, he even climbed the windowsill himself, where he staggered.
Police are continuing to investigate the man.
He does not want to disclose further information yet.
Stosur to prefer daughter before tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not play in the coronavirus-influng season this year.
The 36-year-old US Open champion, who became a mother in June, but she does not want to retire yet.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes she will enjoy tennis even more than before, thanks to her family and daughter.
Stosur announced two weeks ago on social media that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to her daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I'll stay at home, spend time with my family, I'll be with all the little milestones that our Evie will experience in the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world No.1 in doubles said on the Australian union's website.
The WTA Tour will resume the March-lowed season with an August 3-1 win in the Anzac tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Razia reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area was carrying 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the rendering plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
The inspection of the live fish stall was then found to have no proof of origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary perspective in the long term.
Last fall, for example, veterinarians detected an illegal food outlet in it, with almost half a year of unmarked food without origin.
For most, it was impossible to determine the expiration date, some of the products had expired shelf life and were rotten.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the shelf life was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers detained 80 kilograms of food on the market grounds of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, with some of them mouldy.
Putin telephoned with Zelensky before ceasefire in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to take effect from midnight.
According to a statement by the Kremlin, Putin criticized, among other things, the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia, with the support of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The truce is scheduled to begin after midnight at night on Monday, to be "complete and universal" and to open the way for further provisions of the peace accords to be met.
Putin told Zelensky in an interview that the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections contravene the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospect of a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's parliament decided last week that the forthcoming local council elections would not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement foresees that Kiev will bring back control of the border of Ukrainian-rosted territory-occupied separatists with Russia, after granting these regions broadly autonomy and holding local elections.
The Unian agency's Zelensky office said the two statesmen agreed on the utility of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass as well as the need to implement further measures to support peace in the region, such as demolishing areas of fighting or withdrawing parts of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release the Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimea peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped stop the fighting, but in occasional gunfights and artillery attacks, people continue to die on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbass has resulted in over 14,000 deaths since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the war in Donbass a priority, a more fundamental breakthrough in the negotiations but has not yet taken place.
The unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykl, the seven-fight champion is dominated by Novotna
The defending champion of the last two titles, Doležal, failed to finish Saturday's four-hundredth program, and Kopecký did not jump the base in the bar on Sunday.
Tenth-place was ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but withdrew after the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoors MČR so far, this time he was the only decathlete to get over the 7,000 mark.
Other medals were won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
Rykl recalled the absence of both Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora after the competition.
"It's a pity that the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start because the results would have looked very different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I took a 30-centimeter passenger in the distance.
Then I was still pleased with the stick and I was most disappointed by the disc, I was below average there," he acknowledged on the union's Facebook page.
Catherine Cach won the first day of the sevens with more than a hundred-point advantage, despite being tormented by an injured ankle on her rebound.
In the distance sector, however, she then registered only 570 cm, did not tip the javelin for 40 metres and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotna scored 5878 points to win by 241 points ahead of Katerina Dvořáková.
She came out mainly from the distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630.
Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I am very glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all," Novotná said on the union's Facebook page.
Bio LPG arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
The liquefied petroleum gas, the acronym LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its fundamentally lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given a significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled.
Like petrol and diesel, it has its eco-friendly option - the "bio LPG."
But it is quite a novelty - it first appeared on the European market the previous year and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech Association of LPG.
"These days, we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our petrol stations in a mixture with the classic fossil LPG," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas as saying.
Bio LPG, however, cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic petroleum LPG, which is now being refueled by a number of motorists in their cars.
That's why it's also possible to mix both versions at will.
"The only difference from the classic LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about the bio LPG.
This also calls one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and also the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food leftovers and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. wood waste.
In contrast, classical oil LPG is produced partly as a by-product in oil refining, partly by the separation of natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of the bio LPG car is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than operating on oil LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
But it is not the CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but the ecology of the fuel production, the so-called part of the "well-to-tank" (in Czech "from source to tank").
Some of the largest bio LPG manufacturers currently include petrochemical firms Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update to the National Action Plan for the Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also exploring the production option at its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the association's estimates, there are about 177,000 vehicles on LPG; the Ministry of the Environment lists a slightly higher figure in the Czech Republic, roughly 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, nearly 6,000 LPG-powered cars were rebuilt last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG at about 950 stations of various operators in the Czech Republic.
Vojtěch revised in the number of infected, the figure dropped by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers of those infected with the coronavirus virus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The figure dropped from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases on Sunday afternoon, down from 1775 fewer infections.
There are therefore 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"The jump in the number of curedes is the revision of the data, which has not been updated by the hygienists recently," said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had contracted coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 recovered, and sadly succumbed to 371 sickness of Covid-190.
Mobile election units or correspondence choices.
Political scientist and sociologist sought variations for pandemic
In the October regional and Senate elections, people in quarantine because of the coronavirus can also vote, the law is needed, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He made the comments on Sunday in Prima Television's Partii.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions at the ministry with representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change to the electoral law," Hamáček said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution under the applicable legal rules.
But the minister said that a provision of the law would need to be amended, according to which people in quarantine due to their health care cannot vote.
The voting ban should be maintained, for example, for example for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said on the OVM program that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience abroad, it would rather play into the hands of other types of parties) from the correspondence election to overvalued.
It is then personally opposed to the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (elebles) that could be implemented as early as this year and with as little health as possible.
He considers the main one to be ready for the year 2021 when the parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence option (whether only in the foreign nor also in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
He sees the aforementioned election units as the next one, or perhaps the possibility of a proxy vote within the family.
He added that it is a chance to learn how similar situations - -'s election at the time of the coronavirus - - was dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus infection, various types of elections in 67 countries around the world have already been postponed this year.
Protests in Buharsk: Pig ears thrown by protesters at government building
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears onto the government's building.
This was another series of protests against the "mafia style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, DPA reported.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th consecutive day, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
As of at 20:00 there were around 300 people, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators in front of the government building played a theatrical scene in which they symbolically shutted to the prison cell of Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Gešev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the essential demands of the protesters.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health care reform and the end of corruption in the Black Sea coast to be rebuilt.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hajigenov, said on public radio today that a "peak of escalation" is about to take place on Wednesday in the form of a "national rally in Sofia and a blockade in the whole country."
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his reign, as well as the call for early elections.
These are expected to take place in March 2021.
Borisov said earlier that he did not intend to resign.
He justified this by, among other things, the need to carry out Bulgaria with the pandemic covidu kanetland-19 and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, though he did not reassure the demonstrators' concession.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government weighed a vote of confidence in parliament in parliament.
Bologna coach Mihajlovic doesn't want matches without spectators anymore
Bologna Soccer coach Siniša Mihajlovic has had enough Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes to return to the stadiums from the new season.
"What we're doing here at the moment is not football.
I'm sick of fighting without the crowd.
It's sex-free football, it brings me no emotion, no joy.
Those games are worse than practice.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that," said Mihailovich before today's match against Lecce.
The coronavirus break is followed by the Series A matches in quick succession, and although they are not played until the evening, their players are exposed to the heat.
"We play in terrible heat every three days.
In such conditions, you can't even tell how the teams are.
I wish this season would be over.
Those measures had to be taken to get the competition to be played out, but I hope the fans will be back from September," said the coach, who has also led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
This season is also extraordinary for Mihajlovic because he has missed four months on the bench for leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, breaking up the league and everything else, our team managed to move up a level.
We want to keep growing and we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have been the target of a cyberattack of foreign states, Iran says
Since the end of June, fire and explosions has been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said the fire that broke in underground nuclear service in Natanz this month may have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, told journalists, according to Iranian media, that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "a thousand cyber attacks" daily.
He added that it was not a new phenomenon and that most of them would be able to be bounced back.
In recent months, according to Musawi, several broader cyber attacks have been recorded, which, according to analyses, were poseled by "crime governments and groups."
However, he did not share further details of the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musawi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month discussed that Iran's enemies, like Israel and the US, could be behind the recent incidents.
Neither of these countries, however, was charged directly with the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-standing strained relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world's powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a harsh impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the U.S. Army killed Iranian general Qassem Soleman and Iraqi militia leadership member Malez Muhandis on January 3.
Iran then fired a number of missiles at the bases in Iraq, where the Americans are stationed, on 8 January.
The US admitted with hindsight that dozens of American soldiers had been wounded.
Israel considers Iran to be its mortal enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended the shutdown of production, now until 25 May
Cologne-based automaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has re-enclamed production outage due to the coronavirus.
The production lines are expected to restart again on Monday, May 25 in the morning.
Dozens of sanitation measures will accompany the rushing, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the car manufacturer.
Production has been due to a pandemic of coronavirus since the evening of March 18.
The company originally intended to resume it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the shutdown, according to Paroubek, is closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell the cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the start, i.e. for two shifts.
The coronavirus-hit is the hit by key markets for companies such as Italy, the UK or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said the shutdown of production at the TPCA is not signed for life in the city.
"It was obvious at first, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when it's loosened up a lot.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who have remained in the residential hotels.
'We've had almost no problem with these two months,' Kaspar said.
For example, Mladá Boleslav's Škoda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavier crisis, resumed it in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic on Monday, April 27.
Neither of the races operates at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 sanitary measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, a third, night shift took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
The TPCA currently has about 2,500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in Cologne.
Cancer Killed Bride Shortly After Wedding: Left a Message to Family
She had been battling insidious Gemma Sisson cancer for more than two years, and when she seemed to have beaten the cancer, the disease came back.
The 39-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, eventually ended up in bed in a hospice where she still managed to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after she died, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook page's social media account for the closest ones.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her boyfriend, Ricky Moore, with whom she had lived for more than 16 years, traveled around the world for competitions.
The 39-year-old was a sportsman and lived healthily, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope of getting better.
Indeed, after months of treatment, Gemma seemed to have succeeded in winning the cancer, but in August of 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
The culture and personal trainer, according to British Daily Mirror, underwent a ten-hour spinal surgery and then began the drastic treatment again.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-ninth birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the handsome blonde finally decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited every now and then by her family, who even gave her a wedding to her love, Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma one last time to the restaurant on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a social media account showed a post she had written for her family.
"If this has been made public, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart of keeping my beloved here, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank enough to Ricky, who has been by my side all along and has given me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social networking site, noting that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on the social network," she wrote, noting that everyone should value their lives and live it to the fullest.
Art machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and a memory game
A passer-by will receive a pocketworker for a hundred crowns, mostly by aspiring Czech artists.
Images and other productions are created directly for arthropods, so they know in advance that they have to fit into the size 8.5 on 5.5 centimetres.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Widžová, the project's curator.
Arthmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer may thus be surprised at what kind of artwork he will acquire.
Currently, it can become the new owner of the fanciful illustrations of Alexandra Štopleplová or the mini-viewing by Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
The arter Punx 23 in collaboration with Dora Dutková has prepared a memory game associated with a walk through Prague.
The cards must be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladr and Juliána Chom sell a pocket pack of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the tinder and a fortune-teller card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic book, the Spiritist.
Health care pay will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
The larger increase is unrealistic, according to Vojtěch
Health care salaries could rise by no more than five percent next year, said Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for YES) at Václav Moravec Questions on Czech Television.
He finds the trade unionists' demand for an increase of up to 15 percent unrealistic.
He also said that the state should strive to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals, he said, now have their stock.
"I think that the increase (of the payments) may be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when it has intervened since March in the collection of the premier pandemic of the coronavirus and the government regulation against its dissemination.
Insurance companies' income fell at the time.
"I find the 15 percent increase unrealistic at the moment," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute in-patient care, according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS), the nurses will probably reach CZK 88,312 this year, while the nurses will have reached CZK 47,499 respectively.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
Data from IHIS also show that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was CZK 34,125 in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Representatives of trade unionists said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally by 15 percent.
They have long criticised the significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be governed by payroll tables, and contractual wages in hospitals, regions or private hospitals.
They therefore also call for the pay scales to be uniform for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
But for doctors, for example, wages rose faster than salaries last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should perceive how the state is at the moment.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record CZK 500 billion due to the effects of the covid outbreak, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to go to the bonuses of health workers in hospitals and social services.
The Healthcare Provinitor's Board of Healthcare Providers, according to Šmucler, disagrees with the across-the-board salary increases next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals themselves and the medical facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to it through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the Administration of State Material Reserves (SSHR), Pavel Švagr, said this week that the administration did not currently have a single protective health aid in the property.
Waiting for the selection procedures to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
The scorching clever quarantine could be taken over by the soldiers.
We're ready, they say
"Smart quarantine is working, there's room for improvement, of course.
We're going to be in the army's debate tonight.
The army is functioning perfectly and the question is whether they should run the whole thing again," the Prime Minister said on his Facebook show, Hi People, on Sunday.
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect the IT systems and sanitation stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
Problems were, according to the Prime Minister, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defence Ministry spokesperson Jan Pejšek told the Czech Press Agency that he did not have information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this move, according to him.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, a clever quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the military as a government advisory body to be led by former minister's deputy Roman Prymula.
The scrubbing project was criticized by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
He, too, suggested that the army could take him again.
The shortcomings in the project were previously acknowledged by the government's IT and digitalisation commissioner, Vladimir Dzurilla, who is in charge of him.
"The system is working, but it's still being worked on.
For 20 years it was created separately and non-systemically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It's not at bay.
People on the fly, the poor in the hygiene on the march adapt those new systems and actually catch up with the mistakes," he said.
Mayor of Macura in Ostrava will not run again, he does not want to "mudge in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not stand for re-election in the next local elections.
The reason is the attempt to "make it down in politics," he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO presidency, has been the Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 local elections, his leading ANO candidate in Ostrava won almost a third of the electoral votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I'd last one of my terms, and with that business experience, I can flip it all over and get it all up and get it on my feet," he told Respektu.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent for the second term.
"But for me, that's the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics," added Macura, who described himself in the interview as a heavy introvert who is not comfortable with frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation for some time about Macura's possible end in the Yes movement.
The site recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few ANO figures, he supported Zeman's opponent, Jiří Drahoš, in the election.
Macura does not plan to leave the Yes movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile fight and that no one is cuddling me, I have no immediate motive to end," he told Respektu.
The 56-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served as director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark, among others.
He also sat on the boards of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno, offering transport services
Uber, which offers transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is a result of the change in the law, Brno Transport Councillor Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press release on Thursday.
The taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber did not meet the conditions such as a taxi or a meter.
However, the law changes since July the conditions for operating both ordinary taxis and the alternative.
Kratochvíl has held several meetings with representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"On the basis of these, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law, which allows the company to conduct its business lawfully.
The city was acquainted with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the limits," said Kratochvíl.
Uber has worked in Brno in the past.
He was being protested against by taxi drivers for not identifying vehicles as a taxi or missing a meter.
The court has issued a preliminary injunction that banned Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but last year at the end of the year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber was able to drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
It will now be returned by a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to a classic taxi with a flashlight and a meter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively via mobile apps.
An overly exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair hit a foot from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew from the fourth floor of the apartment building in Brno on Saturday evening and landed about a metre from the pavement.
A pedestrian was then on it, who immediately called the officers.
The patrol spotted the open window as soon as she arrived at the address in the western part of the city, with a chair still lying underneath, with a few cans and butts beside it.
"The Ram, who was carrying himself from the fourth floor room, suggested that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
Officers went up the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation," the officers' spokesman Jakub Ghanem said.
Rafaj's appeal request will be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday a request to dismiss the head of the anti-monopoly office (ÚOHS), Petr Rafaj.
The non-profit organizations called for the dismissal of Rafaj at a meeting of the government's anti-corruption council, as well as the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats state that the exchange at the head of the office is in order.
According to ČTK, Rafaj was not invited to the Office of the Government on Monday.
His second mandate will end in the middle of next year, and he cannot be appointed for the third time under the law.
His dismissal is in the remit of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the call of nonprofit organizations, the prime minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason, among others, is the Rafaj's recent case.
In the past week, the prime minister declined to comment on the request, saying he would get acquainted with the materials and the governing parties would take a "signance" on this.
He also said that he had not yet negotiated the challenges with the president, and he did not have a meeting with him anytime soon.
According to the OBR's statement, there is no reason to appeal because Rafaj has not been charged with anything.
The servers of IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz wrote in the past week that the police were interested in Rafaj's meetings with Governor Jiří Čunk.
The meetings have put into contact with, among other things, deciding on the competition for the project of the controversial new Zlín hospital worth eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard.
Čunek admitted the meetings, saying they jointly dealt with his "Senate Activities."
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The Ústí Region council called on the government to appeal Rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the Office's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the ÚOHS regarding public contracts, according to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek, is not transparent and has the hallmarks of its own.
Last March, police intervened at the antitrust office over a toll-collection tender.
In June this year, Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj used apartments written to the company of influential ČSSD backroom player Alexander Čuba.
However, the deposit of 3.5 million for the flat in Brno was paid for from the Rafaja account.
Rafaj has been the chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9. On July 2009, for a second term, the president appointed a former Social Democrat member to a former Social Democrat in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafajovy's second six-year mandate will expire.
The Antitrust Act states that the president can dismiss the chairman of the office at the government's suggestion.
It may only be recalled if it does not perform the function for more than six months, or imparts in serious manner the dignity of its office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the Blanne library, employees collapsed in the heat.
Help air conditioning
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be operational in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
Three children and I go to the library in the centre of Blansko regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was virtually impossible to hold for hold.
It was very hot and bad air.
Ventilation didn't help.
That's why I'm happy for the air conditioning," said one of the blanchee readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the library director, Lukáš Dlapy, temperatures in the building have often climbed to over thirty degrees.
The south face of the building is glassy and acts as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun relies on it for a large part of the day thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, the big problem is to air out the individual departments, because the windows have to be closed overnight for safety reasons.
We often have this way in the library from the morning to 30 degrees," Dlapa said.
The worst part was the study room and the third-floor reading room.
And upstairs, the exhibition room and the principal's office.
There was also an unpleasant climate in the children's ward, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Somehows the librarians collapsed at work and ended up on sick leave.
The problem also occurred regularly in the culture room at dozens of people visiting.
After a few minutes you couldn't breathe," Dlapa observed.
Originally, city officials wanted to do an air conditioning in all the library's premises this year.
In the end, there will only be three circuits out of five.
"Because of limited funding, the air conditioning will only have the most troubled spaces.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
Then the cultural room and the children's department about the floor above," informed Jiří Svoboda from the Blankenship Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had already installed an air-conditioning plant in the said premises last autumn and modified the wiring.
Approximately for CZK 360,000.
The Blansko Municipal Library has nearly three thousand registered readers.
Of that, there are about nine hundred of that.
The Chicago prop chased the coronavirus.
Crawford returns to the game
Not every of the infected athletes comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who keep the health of the players silent as a grave and publish nothing at all.
He was one of the few to step out of the Crawford line.
The 35-year-old from Montreal was only present at the first practice session, having been absent from the line-up ever since.
"I would like to announce to you all that I have been tested positively at Covid-19 and for this I have spent the last fortnight being locked up in my house," he revealed.
Fans no longer need to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into the full load.
"It's amazing to be back.
I'll do everything I can to get into shape as soon as possible," he said.
The veteran goaltender has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a fixed part of the goalie for the fourth season in a row.
The Blackhawks face a preliminary duel with St. Louis, then face Edmonton in the preseason.
Thousands protest in Israel against PM
Thousands of Israelis in several places in the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is dealing with the coronavirus crisis.
The rallies took place, among other things, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and a park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding the resignation of Netanyahu over a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the way the government is dealing with the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the demonstrators wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname, according to the AP.
"Everybody sees the Emperor's loses his clothes," another read.
Netanyahu, 70, is Israel's first prime minister on trial.
He is indicted in three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He rejects all charges, calling them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses being called.
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about 9 million.
455 people have died in connection with the outbreak.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March to help reduce daily increases in the infected.
However, after the gradual easing of the restrictions from the end of April, the numbers of those infected began to rise significantly again at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not helped enough to, say, the tradesmen affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters are also concerned about the fact that the government is issuing divisive instructions in places to fight the coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out of the wreckage by firefighters
The tragic accident occurred around 23 o'clock at Neveklov on the narrow district line leading from the Slap Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at no small speed and smashed the car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be removed from the wreckage by firefighters, among other things, cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are being investigated by police officers.
They ordered a forensic autopsy to clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or any other addictive substance.
The end with the waste and the churning of one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and embarks on a fundamental change in the strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to churd out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters is not new.
Thus, billions of items of clothing end up in the incinerators and in landfills every year.
But the view of slow fashion, often despised approach to dress, has changed quite quickly over the past few years.
About half of the goods were sold to Pietro Filipi at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, is not so easy to buy.
The company does not want to churp out one collection after another and at the end of each season to make the products cheaper below their cost of production.
In addition, according to owner Michal Mička, the days of new and old collections and blind follow-up to rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most merchants count discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a hoax," says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support the local business with its approach.
"Each of our product is made of carefully selected quality materials and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing, which is timeless and above-drop.
Worldwide, the premium brand segment is the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti presents RAF counterfeer Kurt Taussig
"The engagement was to create something to mark the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who had fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city management liked the design," said Vacek, who completed his work after a fortnight of intensive creation.
It consumed about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shenkov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
But he and his brother, thanks to the Nicholas Winton's organization, managed to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig came to the UK, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then underwent pilot training in Africa's South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, who is known to people in the field of street graphic art under the alias Camo, has been working on spray paints in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the areas earmarked for these purposes by the then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna reaches coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight GMT last night) to the southwest coast of the US state of Texas.
It hit the Texas island of Padre Island, roughly 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over the mainland.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a major danger to coastal residents.
It has brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, the AP reports of power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster for the 32 districts in southwest Texas earlier on Saturday and advised people to evacuate voluntarily.
The strongest warning was given to the people of the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay Bay, but in total the element is to hit a territory of almost 500 kilometres long before moving gradually over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and winds, rising levels, dangerous surf and rare tornadoes can pose a threat," warned the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).
This morning, local time (afternoon GMT), the storm was in the U.S.-Mexico border, accompanied by winds of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but it gradually weakened to the mainland to the as long as it progressed to 112 kilometers per hour, which knocked Hanna out of the hurricane category again.
Authorities urged local residents to weather the storm at home, not forgetting the sanitary measures associated with the prevention of the coronavirus to prevent the spread.
Texas is one of the U.S. states that plague the pandemic of covid 19 disease the most.
Given the current security measures and the need to adhere to the distances, possible evacuations are also a major challenge.
The makeshift shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo, Texas County, one of the buildings was also adapted to shelter after evacuees who tested positive for the Coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have called on all evacuees to take the fleece and disinfecting gels with them to hide, if possible.
"It's not even close behind us yet.
We are expecting catastrophic floods," AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS), service in Brownsville, as saying.
Forecasters claim that in some places up to 300 millimetres of precipitation could rain in a matter of hours, in some cases nearly 500 millimetres, which, together with the sea surface, could flood a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman will lend the rank of general to Colonel Lipka
On Wednesday, President Miloš Zeman will lend the rank of general to Colonel Lipko.
This follows an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for the lenting of the rank of brigadier general is the August arrival of Lipka as deputy commander of the alliance's multinational division northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The promotion was proposed to Zeman at the end of June by the government.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as deputy commander of the multinational division of the northeast in Elblag, Poland, in charge of the units of the alliance's forwarding presence in the territory of Poland and the Baltics.
Řehka became director of the National Office for Cybersecurity and Information Security (NÚKIB) in March.
The government proposed to the president that Lipko lend the rank of brigadier general.
Under the Professional Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be bestowed on a soldier for the period of his or her duties or for the period of performance of a service assignment required by the granting of a higher rank.
The post of deputy commander of the Alliance division is matched by the General Ranking.
The soldier to whom the rank has been bestowed has the same rights and obligations as if he were appointed to this rank.
But he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would match the rank.
The loan of the rank continues until the reason for which it was granted.
"Lipka Colonel shows high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
He is instrumental in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and the security of the military's participation in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on the draft promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, attended by Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar or Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronatives standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards are adhering to the distance or wearing the drapes in the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to remain vacant.
Reuters reported the news.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by the officials and that it had yet to be formally approved by the ministers.
The arrangements agreed include the requirement to cover your mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance at security checks and check-in at the airport.
Airplanes must also be guaranteed with enough fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
The airline will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials meet at least some of the airline's requirements.
Different standards were causing confusion.
Arctic Svalbard's temperature record, measured there almost 22 degrees
"There was a 41-year-old record in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
The roughly 2,000-seat Longyearbyen is the largest city on Svalbard, located about 1,300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbard is heating up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers of warming other parts of the Arctic - ’.
The average temperature on Svalbard, according to him, has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could rise by ten degrees if greenhouse gas discharges into the atmosphere is not reduced.
Temperature growth in Svalbard can result in the melting of perpetually frozen ground, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can also cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate heating also threatens arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, who are dependent on the icy cover of the ocean.
Britons returning from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all trips to mainland Spain that are not necessary because of the risk of spreading the disease.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into effect at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomacy said in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones if needed," she added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British are, among other things, concerned about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from the holidays.
Neil Hunter, for example, from Sittingbourne, booked a 10-day vacation in Lanzarote, to depart on Tuesday.
The trip has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as an engineer and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks when I return from my vacation," Metro quoted Hunter as saying.
In the context of Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the start of the second wave of the epidemic.
During the last two days, over 900 new infections have been added there in 24 hours.
Authorities are already tightening coronaviercing in some areas, for example, Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife to prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has recently highlighted the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
Electricity buyout model from Dukovan to be discussed by the government
The government will discuss the purchase model for the electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill envisages that if the feed-in price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, all consumers will pay the difference through fares.
In the latter case, where the feed-in price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for customers.
Both Deputy Prime Minister and Industry Minister Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously said that the more likely option is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term view of electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, as developments have shown several times in the past.
The intention has been criticised by environmental organisations before.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power.
The final impact at the time of applicability of the rule can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact will be spread out among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or consumption of electricity - with higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MEPO) said in the supporting documents for the material.
Havlicek said in May that he expected the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people to make the profits on the Dukovan construction.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns a year per family, which he says is far less than people pay each year in the electricity bills to support so-called supported sources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could range from €50 to €660 (around £1320 to £1,600) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not include any draft amount, to be included only in the purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, to which traders are now most stocked, is currently around 45 euros (about $1190) per MWh.
"With the purchase price difference and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, the supplement of the average household with a consumption of 3,3 MWh per year could be - it can correspond to four-person households, equipped with electrical appliances including an electric hare plate and oven, but which do not use electricity for heating and hot water - less than 100 CZK/year," the MIT government wrote in the documents for the MIT government.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a downright speculative issue," Tomáš Voltr, Executive Director of the Energy Financial Group, told the Czech Press Agency earlier.
The proposed law provides for the purchase being made by the MIT, or the legal entity authorised by it, owned by the state at a predetermined price.
A contract between the investor and the State, guaranteeing the terms of the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, including repeated, but not long past the end of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines as a nuclear reactor electricity plant connected to an electricity system with a minimum capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček said earlier that the new Dablovan block should have a power output of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity annually, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The model of funding for the new Dukovany bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state in construction interest-free, with a 2% interest counted on in operation.
The opposition disagrees with the funding model, and it also resents the possibility of the Dukovany being built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction by 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also pay for any additional costs.
The CEO of ČEZ, Daniel Beneš, told the Czech News Agency in May that the expected sum for building the block at current prices was roughly six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and ČEZ on the construction of the new Duked Bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
Ministry of Regional Development Downloaded Material on Support for Tourism in the Media For Two Billion
The document, according to which the Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, the internet and billboards for advertising holidays in the Czech Republic, was withdrawn from the comment procedure by the authority.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) told the server SeznamZprávy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was highlighted on Friday by Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry justified the plan with a drop in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the revenues and the media also experienced a drop in revenue.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available for inspection on the hlidacstatu.cz website, the MMR planned to give money for advertising on television, radio, print, on the internet, billboards or areas at the stations through the state tourism promotion agency CzechTourism.
The biggest share of the money, namely CZK 700 million, would be given to television.
Most would go to the private Nova and Prima television networks.
Printed diaries and weekly newspapers would receive 400 million and the same episode would be given by the MMR for PR articles, banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of them private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at railway stations or in the metro.
The tourism campaign in the Czech Republic was scheduled to start in mid-August and take a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not in the form that should be presented," Dostálová told the server SeznamMovie without further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) would benefit from the advertisement.
"I firmly believe that this ostentatious contempt will take a shot between the eyes at the election in the autumn of the year," she tweeted.
Dostálová rejects that it is in fact about helping the media hit by the crisis.
"It may also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she told the Daily News N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"We're still counting it, of course, it could be less or more.
It's work material," she added.
The Save Tourism initiative makes no sense to the media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, the chairman of the initiative, on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are located in the state budget, they should be directed at companies, not to the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Spample of life, cock of beers and death like a blade of grass
The third album called A Death is also posthumous with the blade of the Grass of the Brno poet, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and the publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Frič's discography, he is the fifth item, and like the previous titles, the main emphasis is on Frič's poetry, of which he is himself an excellent performer.
Frič, the 1949 edition, was understandably influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was made over his own, personalized experiences and also very visceral expressions of faith.
He was, however, a far cry from the agitation of some agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, totally tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek in that context (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example), the masters will forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of the 2006 author's reading, but also performances with musicians who have always been very sensitive to accompany him, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will - gladly - help myself - in the words of the Ostrava-based poet Petr Hruška about the Fritz's long poetic compositions.
"They were glowing with a proud and never-ending bitterness," Hruška writes, "above the state of our world threatened by extinction.
A world that is increasingly plunging into dull consumerism and aurai, is increasingly moving away from what his soul was made of - the secret of faith, humility, and human closeness.
There was the longing of the one who knows that the values for which he was created are of interest to few, but who also knows that it is not possible to renounce them just because of the general lack of interest.
The poems were reminding us that one might have to lose everything dear, but it is not irrelevant how it would lose it.
If he sells out to general decadence, resigns skeptically, shuts up fearfully, or be left in a quiet and proud insistence on what he believes and loves to do until the last minute."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamacek
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to the Social Democrats.
Party chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Hamacek said on the TV show Prima Partie today.
Paroubek was informed by the news server SeznamZprávy.cz on Friday.
"We text a text from time to time, he sends me some material from time to time, and I'll read it," Hamacek said today.
He added that this was not, however, official and paid cooperation.
The CSSD, he said, does not have the means to waste them for such purposes.
"The fact that I read his opinion sometimes, there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MEP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "are blankly listening to the views of Václav Klaus."
He says it's okay because he's an experienced politician and a former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He described the fact that the media is making an affair a mark of this year's cucumber season.
The server SeznamZprávy.cz reported Friday that Paroubek is fulfilling the role of Hamacek's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is affiliated with Paroubek and served as deputy chair of the party's party in Ústí Region, is heading for the fourth place of the party's candidate in the Ústí Region.
Hamáček said today that he will not comment on the composition of the candidate until it is finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile ahead, it's a kick in the ass, laments the Swede's challenger
The 22-year-old American pole vaulter has ambitions and the potential to be one of the new ruler's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis two years younger, overtaking him at a rally at the NCAA University Association meeting last year.
"We had a battle the year before, he won that day and I was second, then we switched it.
In both cases it was a very good fight," describes Nilsen, who secured the victory with a 5.95 metre performance.
But Duplantis has shot up steeply since then, and is currently alone in the top pole vaults.
At just under the age of 20, he became the world record holder, this year 8. February he broke the bar at 6.17 metres in Tornia, and a week later in Glasgow he added an extra centimetre.
"He jumped six metres at the age of 18 when he graduated from high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he grew from a boy into a man, he would increase all his potential and talent by a thousand.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record," he believes.
While Nilsen's list of achievements is a little bit thinner than the one that boasts Duplantis, the American has set similar goals.
He has hinted at his options so far at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, improving his internal personal record to 5.93m on one of them in February this year. He won the gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Lima last August, having already fought his way into the U.S. team for the World Championships in 2017, where he finished 13.
The next milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because you can make a name for yourself there," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do as well at events such as the Olympic Games, the World Championships or Pan-American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are being postponed, giving Nilsen and the other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, which can easily turn the race under the five rings into a mere contest for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don't think that's possible anytime soon," Nilsen says.
"The kid's been jumping for 16 years and he's got a mile ahead of all the other training."
And by the time Tokyo starts, he'll want to increase it.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands on disability pension for her disabled son.
She's due for the trial
The money the 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily for improving the quality of his life.
The woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to ill health, the court stripped the sick man of his or her sanction and appointed his mother with a guardian to manage, among other things, his son's money.
"From mid-November 2013 to this January this year, the woman used part of the funds from the invalidity pension of her son for her own use, depriving him of CZK 440,000," police spokesperson Dana Ladman said, noting that the accused woman was aggravated by the fact that, as a guardian, she had a particularly imposed obligation to defend the interests of the injured party.
The woman, as instructed to the court, had set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying for the cost of staying with his son in the medical facility and paying for the necessary drugs, she used the remaining funds to purchase the vehicle, electrical appliances and the running of the household," the indictment reads.
That she could not use her son's money for her own use, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping out with them while paying her family expenses.
"We had trouble pulling out of our income to tighten the running of the household.
We've never bought anything above standard.
It was always up to things the son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been populated for 30,000 years, scientists say after the toolmaker's find
Findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone instruments, among which are a fine blade that could be used for meat slicing, and pointy objects that could serve as spearhead or spear tips.
The scientists found that the oldest of the instruments dates from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few of the products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas, and the lead author of one of the two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach 12,500 years.
According to the experts, people inhabited the Chiquihuite cave, located at a high altitude, for a long period of 20,000 years.
The widely accepted theory has spoken of the fact that the first representatives of the Homo sapiens came across the land bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including the unique tip of the spear used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this clovic culture subsequently spread in much of North America.
But this model has been cracked in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, it is written about 42 different locations across North America, which show human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have come to the North American mainland before than previously assumed.
Some could have made it to America by boat.
"It is obvious that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Tleves culture," anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, said of the new findings.
Interest in tickets has so far been fulfilled by an optimistic scenario, the vendors say.
Gradually, prices are also being lowered
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last year's summer, interest is still about half, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
The post-crisis developments thus fill the most optimistic scenarios, according to retailers.
Gradually, ticket prices are also being lowered.
The most sought-after destinations are mainly the southern European states, according to the retailers.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
The portal Letuška.cz sells the most flights to Split, Croatia.
Of the other countries, the most sought-after is the UK, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also being reduced.
At the portal Letuška.cz, it was around CZK 6250 in the middle of the month, up by CZK 3,000 year-on-year.
This is mainly due to the increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices alone are falling to some European sites alone, such as Spain or Italy, down by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers, who are now buying tickets far less in advance than before, fearing the further development of the coronavier situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time for the purchase of the ticket before the departure was reduced by about ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms the future trend, where people will order tickets in a much smaller manner in advance, will require more flexibility, take less risks," said Michal Šindelář, Vice President for Kiwi.com Products.
Currently, the average booking time is 21 days before departure.
Along with the growth of sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also rising.
There are currently scheduled flights to more than 60 destinations at the Prague airport.
Compared to last summer's season, it is about half the destinations.
The grand finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC tournament marched to the grand finale.
It features the experienced 46-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the tournament's surprise, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the charts.
However, he also handled James Wade with a fitting brace in the quarterfinals with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent the world No 1 home.
"Flying Scotsman" had a close call in the semifinals facing Michael Smith.
But he escaped from the gravedigger's shovel at the last minute, dominated in overtime, and after a result of 18:16, he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated in 2018 when he defeated Mensura Suljovic 21-19 in an amazing battle.
World Matchplay's biggest surprise is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and it was perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old dart player first surprisingly knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, they also outmaneuvered Joo Cullen in a dramatic battle, and overcame Adrian Lewis in the quarterfinals after a sharp start.
A big check was the semi-final.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the outset, but the calmly playing Belgian then gained a lead with an excellent run, which he then more or less easily held to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in the high score, which struck the occasional uncertainty of the double.
Coronavirus cases have increased since at least the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic in early March, 15,212 people have been proven to be infected with it.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are sick.
This is according to data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
Maxim was 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positive tested on Thursday, 246 a day earlier and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 were added to the number of infections.
Of the covidos-19 in the Czech Republic, 9 590 people have been cured, or 63 percent of all the ones infected so far.
For most, the disease was mild.
The hospital reports that 151 people with coronavirus are in the hospital, with 19 of whom are rated as serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of the covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days, per 100,000 inhabitants, are still reported by Karvinsko, almost 59.
It is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infections, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events over 100 people, cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals indoors.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be halved from the current 1,000 people.
In the world, the number of people who was demonstrably infected with the new coronavirus has already passed the 16 million mark.
It was reported by the US Johnse Hopkins University, which is following the development of the pandemime globally.
The balance of victims who died with covid-197 disease is close to 645,000, according to this source.
The latest million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell to 22. July.
The largest share of the rapid growth in the number of cases in recent days was the United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people were infected.
The infeitants are now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization announced this week that there were more than 284,000 new cases globally from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily record since the start of the pandemic.
These developments can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous states such as the US, Brazil or India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases has grown in nearly 40 countries around the world in the past week.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The outbreak has already emerged in almost every country in the world, with the DPRK officially announcing the first case today.
Household airs are up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Health harms air fresheners and deodorants
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in the outdoor areas, but also by the home.
This was highlighted by the Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was instrumental in creating the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, domestic pollutants need to be targeted at just now, with many people spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the US Environment Agency (EPA), according to which home-air quality is up to five times worse than the outdoor one.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reckons that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of the poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the Coronavirus Epidemic Epidemic, which has forced many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on the quality of air in homes," Abraham said.
In Israel, she says, the quality of the "home-home air" is hardly addressed.
Dangerous, however, can be the things a person normally comes into contact with - coosculptures, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poison gas is also issued by the garments we regularly carry to the dry cleaners," Abraham said.
Children, she says, are the most at risk, the old members of the household and people with respiratory problems.
Otherwise, healthy individuals may start to experience problems such as headaches, fainting, irritation of the nasal pathways, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergy.
In the long term exposure to unhealthy substances, the internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
But not all of the pollutants come from objects inside the homes, the material from which the houses are built can also be the source.
Vaclav Havel's quiz: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost his chance to reach the top Spanish Football League because of a coroner's outskill.
The competition cancelled the originally postponed duel of the final round of the second league, in which the team could secure a play-off appearance.
Fuenlabrada announced another 12 infected people on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests to the covid-19 at the club to climb to the 28th.
Due to the outbreak in the team, Monday's duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had only taken a point to reach the play-offs.
The competition said today that he finally called off the duel against La Coruni in view of the higher power because it was no longer there.
Fuenlabrada took the decision.
Against the absence of the match, on the other hand, La Coruňa is rebelling.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, the victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save it, but he considers it unfair that the last round did not take place according to the custom complete in a uniform period.
The former elite Spanish club faces a court for the fall to the third tier.
The top two teams in the standings, Huesco and Cádiz, have a certain amount of advancement.
The remaining third-place finish will be played by Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche in the play-off.
Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
Dominika's daughter revealed it
"My dad didn't have to have him for many years," the eldest daughter of Gott Dominika told Aha! noting that the Master could not have come to Havel's name and whenever it came to talk about him, Karl was always annoyed.
It was hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominika, the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that it was easier than he did.
That Havel could have written in his drawer at the time of the Dark Ages, but if he had somehow resisted, he would have had an end to his career," Gottová says.
But he adds that in the end, the Czech giants did find their way to each other.
"I know the word Havel couldn't have heard until his sixtieth.
But then the president congratulated him in a birthday letter and suddenly his dad's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
Indeed, ten years later, Gott even invited the then former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where the new era of their relationship began, because Mr. Havel's dad then regularly invited Mr. Havel home to his house in Bertramka," said the blonde, whose father died last October.
The Nightingale was also said to be annoyed that he had never received a state award from Václav Havel.
After all, he did see it in 2009, even though it was already from the hands of his successor as Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive further honours in memoriam, as the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to be awarded the Order of the White Lion to honor his memory.
