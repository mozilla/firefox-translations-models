An unusually open and unique painting by Karel Gott in the feature-length documentary film by Olga Špátová
This unique film from the workshop of Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
"In the middle of September last year I got a call from Ivanka and Karel Gott, and I was asked if I would make a documentary about his life with Karel again after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! Filming with a man who has lasted more than half a century in the limelight of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immense industriousness was and is a great honor for me. I accepted the call to make a feature-length documentary about Karel Gott, who brings joy to three generations of listeners with his art, as a commitment to this legendary singer," says director Olga Štátová.
The first shooting day was already 22 thanks to a quick agreement and agreement. October last year and the last shots with Karl Gott were shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself away to his supporters, as a painter but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who has been giving joy to several generations not only in Europe and around the world for sixty years with his songs. A man who has written himself in the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not meant to be a showcase of the indisputable glory of Karel Gott and his achievements. "That's why it's not even possible to compare my previous film The Gott Phenomenon with this current one. Everyone is different. At least by filming them in a different stage of Karel Gott’s life, and this will be very reflected in his personal, even intimate confession, which he gave us and that has confirmed us all in what legend we have the opportunity to work and spend time with, which is truly indescribable,” adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in the Czech Republic and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, in a cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. The film will be quite authentic and unique thanks to the sincere openness of Karel Gott.
"Olga has a great gift of filming with her close team so that we often got carried away by a spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about topics quite intimate. With her husband, the cameraman Jan Painter, they actually became part of our family. Originally, we wanted to present the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life anniversary. But because I had a wonderful summer with my family, I wanted us to film as long as possible. Well, and because there were a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was to be put in cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary film is a thank you to my supporters and to all those who supported and accompanied me in my profession,” says Karel Gott himself.
Insects are up to sixty times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Bugs, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. However, there are growing reports that the insect kingdom is becoming radically shrinking. Another scientific study on this topic was published this week, and the situation is even more serious than humanity has been aware of.
The study is based on field research in the tropical forest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write at the beginning of the report, insects are "ten to sixty times less" in the forest today. It is a decrease of the entire population, i.e. not the number of species, while the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of another fauna, which is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also thinning.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. The average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the past thirty years, and warming has become a driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the author’s team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.
A large article in the Washington Post published on Monday, which makes the new findings headline as hyperalarming. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," David Wagner, an entomologist at the University of Connecticut, told the paper, citing as an independent expert.
The extinction of insects also affects Europe. "In our country, the decline is also orderly," points out Lukáš Čížek from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, however, in addition to climate change, it is necessary to take into account the changes of the landscape, which play an essential role in Europe. "It's just running for a significantly longer time than in Puerto Rico," Čížek adds, explaining why scientists could measure such a rapid decline in the forest compared to the 70's.
Czechs in Europe Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia reject the Munich Agreement in 1938 and go to war with Germany? NOT Three Times
The undated image depicts Adolf Hitler during a visit to the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the forts was never to stop the German army, but to slow its progress before the Allies became involved.
If almost exactly 81 years ago Czechoslovakia rejected the Munich agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would exclude the most Czechoslovak soldiers from the fight? German tanks, the air force, or perhaps artillery? Perhaps it would not be either of these weapons, even if the Germans had a crushing advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the biggest losses − because of blisters.
Chairman of the police union Štěpánek resigns, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Police Union, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave office. It was reported on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the unions since 2005. He will be president of the union for two more months. He will remain with the police even after leaving the union.
"I can confirm that I handed over my written resignation to the bureau this week, after which I will continue to serve fully for two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I have decided as a free man who does not want to be forever attached to the trade union. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the association participated in police protests against cuts in the budget or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. He also got into a dispute with the then interior minister, Radek John, in 2011 and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the governing coalition later agreed to John's departure.
The Museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with the exhibition
Imitation of a normalization room with a television running footage of a brutal crackdown by police officers against students of November 17, 1989 in Prague. This is also the case at the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said Tomáš Chvátal, the exhibition's curator.
"I would say that the atmosphere was the same everywhere, with the fact that in Semily the first demonstration was on November 22, and then every day more people gradually packed up," he said. Among the most active were from the beginning a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the immediate vicinity to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečeks, who expanded the petition Several Sentences. According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was also created quite quickly. "One specific thing is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," the curator said.
Approximately 50 photographs should be taken by visitors to the events in the city at that time, the pictures were taken by Karel Bárta 30 years ago. There is also a video from the general strike on November 27, 1989, shot by František Tomíček, who will be in a loop for the entire duration of the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke at the demonstration and sang. The Semil archive also lent a number of surviving banners to the exhibition. "There was on them: Let's not get drunk with a roll, From the trough to the trough, we don't want violence," Chvatal said. Some of the changes in the city were very quick at the time, for example, in December, people in the all-Semili vote decided that the square would be Riegrovo and abolished the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures events before the November events. "In the first part, we introduce the witnesses and students, what was before, such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether it is banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plate from the then museum of the workers' movement," Chvátal said. One room is supposed to just make you feel what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household.
The last part of the exhibition is devoted to what was after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one of the poll posters. Those who have experienced this remember the posters With Us to Europe or Václav Klaus is still under the banner of the OF with a beautiful motto Everyone for their own community," the curator added.
Let the fans be positive, Hašek wishes. Sparta is waiting for a chatter in Pilsen
"We will play at the limit of possibilities, we will do everything we can to succeed. To manage the match both gamely and results," Spartan Martin Hašek promised in an interview with club television.
In the week, the goal was decided by a cup duel in Jihlava (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was an obligation for her. She was relieved, but she continued to struggle gamely.
Although the season is slowly spilling over into the second period, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek spoke about at the beginning of his engagement.
"But it's still Sparta that has very good players. We have a difficult match ahead of us," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans arrived in Štruncovy sady for the last time, in mid-May it was a definite matter in the superstructure. The guests left after a mindless performance with a 0:4 beating, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the match, Sparta are now losing nine points after ten games of the new season. He's experiencing one of the worst entries of the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation either for us or for the fans who would like to see their beloved club in a completely different way than it is at the moment," Hašek feels. "But we would like them to continue to support us, to stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if in Pilsen he will be able to use Tetteh, who received a two-match penalty for the exclusion in Pilsen, but on Friday he appealed against it.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec remain on the numerous moradka, remembering the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011.
The home side, who, including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, have won the last five games, should only meet the midfielder Čermák. And as captain, defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan offspring, should lead them into the match.

The link to both games is on the Epic Store here. You can include the games in your library directly through the web, but you need to download the Epic Games Launcher client to play. You have until 3. October.
Metro 2033 Redux is a modified version of the original game from 2010, adding both graphic and gameplay changes from the sequel to Last Light.
The story, based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's book of the same name, takes place in 2033 in Russia after the nuclear war. The Earth's surface as we know it no longer exists. Humanity had to take shelter, in our case, into the vast complexes of the Moscow metro.
"Take the post-apocalyptic world and the oppressive atmosphere from an unfamiliar environment, take on the vastness of the world and add a lot of spectacular scripts and action passages and traditional: Metro 2033 is in the world," we wrote on Bonusweb in a period review.
Everything, by contrast, is a relaxing play-not-play in a procedurally generated world that carries the message of English writer and philosopher Alan Watts. A player can become anything, from animals to trees to the planet.

"The horrifying result of the study." Islam does not belong to the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Nearly 60 percent of Austria's population fears some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would demand the introduction of a ban on mosque construction. For greater monitoring of the centers of Islam, 80 percent of respondents are.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, arguing that they sometimes feel like foreigners in their own country because of the presence of Muslims.
"The result of the study is terrifying," argues study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a propensity for ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a risk that religious freedoms, granted to Muslims, will be narrowed.”
For believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. According to the sociologist, dialogue and education could help to blunt the polarization.
The most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without higher education or seniors over the age of 75. The most welcoming, on the other hand, are the Green voters, people under the age of 30 and undergraduates.
According to estimates by the Austrian Interior Ministry, around 700 thousand Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of about 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer rooms and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
Thomas Cook: Czechs thrown out of hotel in Mallorca. The guarantees were not enough
The Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group also filed for insolvency earlier in the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently under discussion, it should be decided by the end of September.
According to the Vice-President of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan Pope, there are three options for possible solutions in the game - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will establish a new travel agency. "Which one it will be, but cannot be predicted, will depend on the German owner," he told the Czech News Agency.
In addition to two prematurely completed tours, CK also deals with cases where clients had to pay for their stay, even though the company tries to guarantee the hoteliers. CK promised to pay its clients payments, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient security.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the pope described to the Czech News Agency one of the cases when the hotel fired all the tourists' offices. "The hotelier has not been able to determine who belongs to the German and who belongs to the Czech society. He therefore threw everyone out of the hotel despite the fact that the domestic Neckermann provided a guarantee," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was finally resolved.
The Czech branch of the failed British group Thomas Cook increased its sales to 995 million crowns last year, almost 21 percent more year-on-year, according to the company’s annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. The company’s net profit, on the other hand, decreased by about seven million to 15.3 million crowns. However, the company remained unpaid for a loss of almost 103 million crowns. The branch includes two core divisions - alongside CK Neckermann, it is also the company Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Trump considers lifting U.S. Chinese stock registration
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering canceling Chinese firms' trading permits on stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. The shares of the firms concerned on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the report, pulling the entire market with them.
The withdrawal of shares would be part of a broader effort to curb U.S. investment in China, the source added. He confirmed a report by Bloomberg that had caused a shock in financial markets shortly before. Shares of Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost from two to four percent.
According to government data from February, shares of 156 Chinese firms are trading on the U.S. exchanges of the Nasdaq and NYSE. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.
Bloomberg said a precise mechanism has not yet been developed to secure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges. A possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, who, however, gave the green light to the negotiations on the matter.
China and the U.S. have been waging a trade war with each other for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has had negative effects on the world economy and raises fears of a recession in the global economy. Using customs duties, Washington is trying to get Beijing to change trade practices and reduce China's surplus in U.S. trade.
According to CNBC, trade talks between the U.S. and China should be resumed by 10. October. His goal is to end the trade war.
Police charge CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác over promotion contracts
Police have accused the former manager of the state-run CzechTourism agency, Aleš Pangrác, of contracts for promotion. The gang of the SeznamNews server confirmed that he took over the allegations this week. Czech Television (ČT) said last year that police officers were examining contracts worth 38 million crowns in the case. Some of the money was returned to Pangrác, according to police. In the case, criminals were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development Klára Dostálová (for ANO), whose CzechTourism department falls in. The investigation into the case continues, according to the server.
Detectives from the National Headquarters against Organized Crime provided evidence in this case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry of Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The company's computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. The court order for the search at Dostálová, which was previously quoted by the Czech Television, stated that the minister decided in 2016 when she was a deputy, on the expenses of CzechTourism in favour of the chosen persons through mediation and outside the standard official procedure. Dostálová said at the time that she felt absolutely innocent, she had no doubts, she can document everything and cooperate fully with the police.
According to the agency, it was an individual's misconduct. The media has previously stated that it is the former director of the regional partnership department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. This showed that CzechTourism has concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, I was accused. But that's all I want to say about it," the North's Pangrac told the News List.
Vandal destroys cemetery in Dobruška

"The material damage was calculated at 60 thousand crowns. Police are asking any witnesses to the event to communicate their findings in person at the office or by phone on toll-free line 158," police spokeswoman Lucie Konečná said.
Criminals are investigating the case as damage to a foreign object and disorderly conduct, for which they face up to three years in prison.
Hundreds of enslaved children freed from Nigeria religious school
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing a police commissioner, said there were over three hundred children from the age of five. Some were chained together, others were chained to the iron circles in the wall.
The head of the police in Kaduna, Ali Janga, told the BBC that the raid at the school was carried out on the basis of a statement. He called the school a house of horrors. Starved people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was a razor wire above the walls. According to him, this is a case of slavery.
Several people were detained during the raid, according to police spokesman Jakub Sabo, who was a local teacher.
The children told police they were taken to school by their parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most of them were brought here by parents from Nigerian states in the north," the spokesman said. The Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The school of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal pretended to be a religious school focused on the study of the Koran.
The freed were taken to a stadium where they are provided with help and food. Some have already met relatives.
French chef sues Michelin over removal of star I suffer from depression, he says
The famous French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after winning it. With the publisher of the red guide, he intends to sue to receive the exact reasons for the degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competences of Michelin inspectors, who, according to him, mistook saffron for cheddar. The first trial is due to take place in November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Upper Savoy lost one of the three Michelin stars in January this year. The publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin will be sued because, according to him, the conclusion of the commissioners was not properly justified. According to him, the removal of the star occurred without any notice. “I’ve been depressed for six months. How dare you mess with the health of the chefs?" Veyrat told the commissioners.
Michelin is said to have given the chef only vague reasons, such as that the chef put in the soufflé cheddar, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it and those gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I have been working with Savoy ingredients since the beginning," he objected to Veyrat's decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are fraudsters who just provoke disputes for commercial reasons." The indignant Veyrat doesn't understand "how could they afford to say we put in our souffle cheddar." "They also insulted our region, my employees were crazy about it. We have eggs from their chickens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he said.
The distinctive cook, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is an opponent of a new generation of Michelin commissioners, and therefore demands the exclusion of his restaurant from a red guide. The publisher, however, rejects this. “If the company stays open and our inspectors re-select it, we will continue to recommend it,” said Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin’s international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit testifies that he has no meaningful charges yet and a lawyer is yet to help him formulate it. "We are sorry that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us rudely. We will examine his comments carefully," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
Technically perfect confusion with a weak scenario. Gemini and Will Smith have not been aggravated by the criticism
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith will stand up to his younger version in the film. According to critics, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be held in Czech cinemas 10. October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the absolute leader in his field. It kills effectively and without unnecessary questions. One day, however, he decides to hang his career on the nail. Of course, his employers don't like that, who send another killer to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, more precisely his younger clone made of DNA. Can one determined man win a fight over himself? This time literally.
A certain guarantee of quality was to be the three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee. It is his first sci-fi, but he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated, for example, in the aforementioned Tiger and Dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. Six screenwriters collaborated on the script. The most famous is definitely David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. According to the first testimonials, all this was not enough for a good movie.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to pick it up," said Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.
"This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents that have contributed to it. The weak script and the plot are held together only by the technological magic of filmmakers," Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter summarized his opinion.
"A gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work has resulted in an incredibly blunt action film," said Peter Deburge, a reviewer at Variety.
"A confused product with a bizarre idea," Ella Kemp of the IndieWire website summarized in her review.
"It's hard to care that one man is a double of the other when neither is acting like a human," Nicholas Barber of The Wrap wrote.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's accounts banks provide for free. However, the offer should be considered because some other account services are already charged. "Motivating banks to offer bills for children whose basic management is free is straightforward. Financial houses are counting on their forbidded fees to be refunded once. With the small migration of Czechs among banks, they are probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
"Small accounts" can do almost everything that adult accounts do. The child gets his own credit card, can enter payments, track movements in the account, somewhere has his own electronic banking. Banks will set up an account, but it is up to parents to teach children how to treat them and also to check their payments.
"Relatively flexibly, a parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services, and the like. Above all, however, it can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by looking over the Internet or by SMS. Attention, they may not be free anymore," Kuncová adds, adding: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, he should consider his abilities and options."
Strict but fair, we enjoy the hours! This is how the Benešov grammar school students see their favorite teacher writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, Pavel Hoza is convinced. The secondary school teacher of Czech and history is also a poet, prose writer and awakener of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek will be thinking of Pavel Hoza's lyrics. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish country houses, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have been after them for centuries. Grieving, cursing, blessing. This contemporary successor of Reynek teaches Czech, Literature and History at the Benešov Grammar School, and runs the equivalent of Prague’s Viola in Café na slovíčko and organizes the Benešov Literary Festival every year.
Wife swap: Ondra's parents cruelly abused! He ended up in an institution
It was about nerves. The allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father every now and then. "He came home from school and lied with a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said that he would kneel for punishment," Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! Outside the cameras, he said he had to suffer like this on a wooden pad to massage his feet! "Ondrej came to me after filming and told me - Auntie, I'm doing the troubles and the notes just so I'm not here because I want to go to an institution," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was going on behind the studio apartment door. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after filming and placed for a month in the Centre for Educational Care in České Budějovice. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) for a short time, but then traveled to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I got home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we texted for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I barely responded to that at all. But then she texted me that the little one was in the institution, that then they returned it to them, now he's in the diagnostic. They are both out of work," says his mother Lucie from Pilsen.
Lightning, of course, also addressed the other side, but received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call later," Aneta said, hanging up the phone.
Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against a double-match penalty
Football Sparta have appealed against a two-match penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, who received a player from a disciplinary committee for exclusion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
The Letna club have reported on its Twitter feed and are now awaiting the verdict of the appeals committee.
Half of the penalty has already been served by Tetteh in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta are now aiming to ensure that the twenty-two-year-old Ghanaian striker can play in Sunday's round 11 of the first league in Pilsen.
The situation from last October could be repeated. At that time, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon Falta, who on Thursday received a distance from the disciplinary committee for one match for exclusion against Liberec.
The appeals committee failed to discuss the case, so it postponed the effectiveness of the sentence and Falta was allowed to take office on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The Commission finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the next week and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
Disciplinary Tetteh stopped the activity for a foul on the famous David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spit of the Ghanaian player on the captain of the opponent Tomáš Souček has not been proven.
The Germans elected Keller to head the Football Association
The new chairman of the German Football Association, Fritz Keller, the current head of the Freiburg Bundesliga, has become the new chairman. The sixty-two-year-old winemaker, gastronomist and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years, he did not have an opponent.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April because of an affair with unacknowledged income. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go on trial for possible bribery while assigning the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said one of the main goals would be to return the union's confidence and take it out of the crisis. "It's not going to be a One Man Show, a lot of people will be held accountable. The union is better than his reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the slogan: Together we can do it.
After being elected to head the union, Keller left office in Freiburg.
There was a fire in the underground of the CSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the CSA Mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, told the Czech News Agency.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in a disease at a depth of about 1200 meters. "None of the employees were hurt, no one was injured. The place was immediately intervened by the rescuers of Ban, who immediately extinguished the fire by direct intervention and carried out an examination of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and disabled," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karvina region, coal is already mined only in the Karvina part, in the mines of ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-Sever and ČSM-South. Mining in the Lazy mine should end later this year, the other mines are also waiting for a gradual downturn. The mining company OKD is the only producer of coal in the Czech Republic, its production last year was 4.62 million tons. There are 9000 people working in the mines.
Berlin is responding to public pressure and is dealing with the housing crisis. 6000 flats will be purchased from a private company
Berlin will buy 6000 former social apartments from private Luxembourg-based ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros (23.8 billion CZK) that the city sold 15 years ago. It is responding to pressure from the public, which is rebelling against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher, for the Left (Die Linke) party, this is the largest such buyout in the history of the capital of Germany. The opposition criticizes the move.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give certainties to tenants," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat rent freezes," he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take over thousands of apartments located in the districts of Spandau and Reinickendorf in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too expensively. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that, according to his estimate, the housing unit overpaid about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition Liberal Party (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation. The FDP said in a tweet on Friday. The move was called the protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) a "waste of money."
Already in mid-July, Gewobag received back 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The council did not publish the award. The dispute over apartments on the former exhibition class from the time of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the difficult situation of tenants in major German cities, the newspaper wrote.
The German capital used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, she has gained in attractiveness. Rent prices have doubled over the past decade, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
Nokia is suing the company over the name Lokia. People won't mistake us, the Moravians believe
Nokia has filed an objection to the Lokia brand's application to the Industrial Property Office. According to CCV, however, product confusion is unlikely.
The Brno-based company developing the CCV software is facing legal action from Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. The Finns do not like the fact that the program of the Brno warehouse management company is called Lokia WMS, wrote the daily E15. Nokia has therefore filed objections to the Lokia brand application to the Industrial Property Office. The CCV believes that confusion is not likely.
Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek said the program has been used by two dozen customers, it has been on the market since last September.
“The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone tries to register a stamp that we believe may lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said in a statement.
Brno developers say that they did not think about the brand famous in the past by mobile phones when creating the warehouse program. The designation Lokia according to CCV is based on the Latin name for one type of dragonfly, the rapid movement of which is to be an analogy of the movement of warehouse workers around the warehouse.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software, which companies equip their warehouse operations with, and we do not really head to the field of mobile phone production. And we do not want to compare it to a brand that may be missing a train in his field," said CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák in E15.
CCV applied for the protection of the brand in August before the program was launched at the Industrial Property Office. "It requested protection for products and services belonging to Classes 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to Class 9, the related warehouse business management services belong to Class 35 and the development of computer software up to Class 42 according to the international classification," Ondrášek said.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the earlier Nokia trade mark is valid in all classes of goods and services, thus covering the widest possible range of goods and services, and therefore, of course, also overlaps in Classes 9, 35 and 42. "The CCV does not dispute the claim of the objector when it comes to compliance on these classes of products and services. In reality, however, these are completely different brands aimed at other target groups," Ondrášek said.
The brand dispute can take months, according to E15, and it can complicate the company's activities.
From Sydney to London in four hours? Possible reality in 2030
The Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket. It is designed to power the aircraft at twice the speed of the Concordes. "When the Sabre engine is put into operation, it could allow us to fly to Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. And, for example, the distance between London and New York could be offended by the plane in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which the speed of sound is five-fold, are complicated due to engine overheating. However, Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem by using super cold helium, which should prevent the rise in temperatures.
"The most important thing about the Sabre is that it is a hybrid of rocket and aircraft engine that is powered by a stream of exhaust gases generated from the air," said Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "The missiles have not undergone such a big development in the last 70 years, while the aircraft have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and you will basically create a spacecraft.”
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights around 2030.
Kovosvit sells the office building and other halls. He expects worse times
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million crowns, the consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. The main problems of last year are the Chef's lack of workers and shifts in subcontractors. This year, demand for machine tools has fallen, by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected decrease in turnover by an order of ten percent," the CEO said. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of 1.3 billion crowns and a profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land that it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where out of five floors it uses two, and not yet completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit, streamline its activities. The sale of assets is not part of a current solution, whether it is cash-flow, but part of a long-term plan, when we want to devote all resources to investment development," the CEO said.
About half of Kovosvit's production exports. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, last year to a lesser extent Asia. This year, the chef ranks among the most interesting India, where Kovosvit won a contract for machines allowing five-axis machining worth 100 million crowns. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines for 30 million crowns to China. "The negotiated is another contract in the same volume, which we would like to meet before the end of the year," Kuchař said. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit is facing restrictions on sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centres to France, a company that is a subcontractor of Airbus. This May, she delivered another machine, one more should be delivered at the end of the year or early 2020.
The main corporate investment this year was the transition of heating from steam to hot water for 20 million crowns. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average workers' wage is 28 500 crowns. The company is looking for casting cutters for foundry, machine tools, turning machines and electricians.
The company has been owned since September 2016 by industrialist and armament engineer Jaroslav Strnad. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Bat'a. The company had up to three thousand employees.
Milan Jakubů: The funeral was stolen by the army for itself! Says Andor Šándor
There is still confusion surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated earlier in the week that the army had planned the final farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence despite the wishes of the bombastic family, as only soldiers could. There were also irregularities about the date of the funeral. Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family since the beginning, the arranged Friday funeral date is valid from the beginning, no one has changed it. Just like military honors. We will only deal with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek said on Wednesday. The funeral will eventually take place on Friday and will not be missing all military honors, including the flyover of fighter jets.
There is a tense atmosphere around the last farewell to the popular general. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by people who have worked with the general in the past!
It is, for example, the former head of military intelligence, Andor Šándor (62), who met with Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Šándor remembers his former colleague as a hardworking, intelligent and "good guy."
In addition, he has met him regularly in recent years at the celebrations of the anniversary of the founding of the Military Intelligence. That's why he'd like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I personally would have gone to the funeral of Milan Jakubů," Šándor told Blesku. But he can't.
"I also know about other people from the organization who would like to go, but are out of luck because the potentates will usurp the funeral for themselves. I think that privatizing a funeral in this way is not right," the security expert said. He is not even playing the allegedly considered closure of the ceremony to the public because of the secrecy of army leaders.
"The leadership of the army is not kept secret and the leaders of the military intelligence are not either, because they are being promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media information is true and the family has actually been left behind by the military, it is of course a matter for the family. I personally would never allow the army to overwhelm the family and her wishes," Šándor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday near Špindlerův Mlýn in a car accident. The frontal collision of Milan's Rapid with the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer in the corner should have driven into the opposite direction, Milan Jakubů apparently did not have a chance to prevent the clash. His wife, 47, suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police heard the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Commentary by Jan Šindelář: Managing Railways as a Company
The heavenly election, although apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the inability of the state to give the dears a clear direction. The board has been incomplete for over a year and even after Wednesday night, it doesn't change because one of the members has resigned. The provisional lasts.
The selection procedure itself was a farce from the beginning because the requirements for candidates were significantly reduced, especially in the field of practice. Compared to the selection last year, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was supposed to operate in the past were reduced. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlats.
Nebeský probably presented the weakest professional CV of five finalists, yet without practice from a large company, he rubbed experienced fighters from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. It was the participation of interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the brightest side (even the best hope) of the whole process. Today, they know that they have played only the role of epic scenery in the political game.
Maybe Heaven's surprise will show great talent and eventually turn out to be the greatest boss of the tracks of all time. At least in the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by the taste of political traffic. Czech Railways does not expect a light period, they have to cope with the competition in the liberalization of the market and with the lack of employees in operation. There are no drivers, shifters and mechanics. What motivation should they have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves in senior management like an elephant in porcelain?
The second important group is creditors. We'll see how the tracks are played at the head of the tracks next spring when the tracks defend the credit rating. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. The sad thing is that someone else goes to Moody's to defend the rating every year. The agency did not escape frequent changes in the management of the railways and political influence on the company, criticizing them already this summer.
Among other things, the ANO movement has the slogan that the state must be run as a company. For starters, it would be enough if one big state-owned company was running as a company, and not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if the best ones would lead them. They reported, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive ourselves for the clownings with the selection process.
The pair wrapped the bitch with tape and drowned in the river, the bag was found by children
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouky. A twenty-seven-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old that she wanted to take care of. However, her ten-year-old partner did not like that she was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal with duct tape and rope and greatly eliminated his voice. He put the dog in a jute bag he had tied. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in the bag. At the moment when the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive," said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The following day, children playing by the river found a jute bag on the shore. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. They called the woman walking by and ran away. The woman reported the event to the emergency call line police 158.
"The police, thanks to the knowledge of the townspeople, found out who was probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they weren't wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the incident took place," a police spokeswoman added.
A professional statement in the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a clearly tormented manner due to suffocation, when the animal suffered in a matter of minutes before death.
"The conduct of the perpetrators no doubt points to a clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible way, even if they could donate or sell the dog. The commissioner of the criminal police from Zlín accused the couple of the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both still unpunished charges could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková said.
Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen releases latest album after death
The album Thank You for Dance will include unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish the songs. On an intimate recording, Cohen symbolically copes with the impending death. He died a month after the album was released at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials he had left behind. He invited a number of musicians to collaborate - randomly Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or singer Beck.
"When we invented music for our father's words, we used his own characteristic musical practices. He's still with us," Adam Cohen said. "What amazes me most about him is the reactions of those who have heard him before. One by one, they say Leonard is still alive," he added.
The album's first swallow is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost at home," Cohen sings in her characteristic honey voice. He sang about death, suspected that he would not live to see the release of new material. He also admitted this in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable," he declared.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published a collection of poetry of his father called The Flame. Czech will be published under the title Flame on December 31 at the publishing house Argo.
The first miss Christ finally went into herself: She lost a few pounds and saw through right away
The first modern miss from 1989 Ivana Christová (49) had problems with overweight, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly mental problems. She suffered because she has changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it seems that she took the criticisms to her heart and with excess pounds she went into battle. Even if it's a long run.
It used to be a first-class beauty who conquered Paris. But thirty years have passed since then, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty pageant. Not just because of fame, but also because of how skinny she was.
Over time, she decided not to submit to strict modeling rules, which ordered her to be as slim and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in what she wanted.
But from hunger strikes she went to overeating, which immediately signed off on her figure. In addition, Kila tried to disguise herself with various loose clothes, which, however, added to the size of the plump shapes.
Now it looks like Ivana really went into herself. She lost weight, starting to dress tastefully and appropriately to her fuller figure.
She surprised everyone at the baptism of the book by Miloš Zapletal (75) that she saw through again and already has back the features of a charming brunette, who in 1989 entered history not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also by the controversy of her victory.
Christová will forever be the first beauty winner, but also the very first one that the audience in the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava whistled like the senses of deprivation when she put on a crown.
"Parody of Justice." Scientist warns of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish jail
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in the study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. It concluded that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country is related to increased cancer rates among locals.
The researchers mentioned mainly the industrial zone of Dilovasi, which lies about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metallurgical plants are located. People living in its neighborhood suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan avenges for coup, international criticism despite
It seemed to Sik that the government was not taking any action on the matter, despite the clear conclusions of the study. He wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. Authorities subsequently began prosecuting him for leaking classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict was handed down. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies directly related to public health can be concealed. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"Turkish authorities should investigate this important public health problem instead of persecuting people sounding the alarm through the courts," said Andrew Gardner of the Turkish branch of AI.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of not forcing environmental regulations in certain regions despite the rapid development of industry.
After a thwarted 2016 coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime began a large-scale wave of arrests. Nearly 80 000 people are now behind bars, including a number of Cumhuriyet newspaper staff. Authorities have also put out of service or completely laid off 150 000 civil servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute its opponents. However, the authorities argue that these are measures necessary to ensure national security.
The planet's fastest man has missed his tests. I'm not taking anything, he's defending himself
A traditionally high-profile fight for the fastest man on the planet will be a hunt for silver medalist Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The twenty-three-year-old American is the leader of the world tables with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. However, his start at the peak of the season was threatened due to a case with missed doping tests.
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without charges due to formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping exams last year and this year, but not within 12 months. His first offence was reported by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on April 1, 2018, the beginning of the second quarter, but missed the test itself up to 6. June. And because the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit wrongdoing in the form of three non-implemented checks within 12 months.
Coleman argued that he had merely forgotten to update the data in the app about athletes' whereabouts. "I don't take drugs, I don't take anything legal. A lot of athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's about," he declared before the start of the World Cup.
He suffered his only defeat from six of this year’s 100th start when he entered the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was surpassed by Noah Lyles by just six thousandths of a second. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but he will only run two hundred at the World Championships.
The second fastest paper racer is the 9.86-year-old Nigerian Divine Odudur, who has only been successful in American university competitions.
The title will be defended by the 37-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a time of 9.87 in Stanford in June. The last hundred in Zagreb, however, ran in only 10.29, because he slightly injured his hind thigh muscle.
The favourites also include South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic gold medalist from Rio Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican with a time of 9.96 is 2011 world champion Yohan Blake.
The men's hundred will begin Friday with a preliminary round and run-ups. The semi-finals and finals are on the agenda on Saturday. The medals will be held at 21:15 CEST.
Plane crash near Žinkov in Pilsen region: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people, a man (†63) and a woman (†38), were on the plane. "The plane at half past nine in the evening asked for permission to land at the airport Chaloupky near Klatovy," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said. This was also the last record, at that time, according to the GPS coordinates, it was supposed to be located near Vojovice near Žinkov.
However, it did not reach the airport in Klatovy. The missing aircraft, which sent a distress signal, immediately began to be searched. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter was also involved," police spokeswoman Martina Korandová said. The search did not have a happy end.
In the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from where the plane last reported, the wreckage of the helicopter was noticed before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korandova confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of the trees, the pieces also fell on the ground in the surroundings. "We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and staff of the Institute for the Professional Investigation of the Causes of Air Accidents," Korandová added.
Civilization in the Lent Time
Recently, I remembered a beautiful "line" from one of Šimek's great short stories with Grossmann, which takes place partly in the cemetery, which reads like this: "I warned her that she was crying well, but on a foreign grave!" It occurred to me that many of the world’s politicians, engaged in the senseless fight against climate change, are behaving very similarly now.
They act as if people were ruling on planet Earth. In fact, we are just a speck on her surface, which she can blow out with her fierce forces like a violent whiff of wind the flame of a candle. Probably few of them look at the famous British and American natural science documents dealing with the destruction abilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for some of the larger active volcanoes to "get up" properly, and our advanced civilization will fall from it.
And that this will happen in the immediate future is highly likely. A number of large volcanoes, in the opinion of leading volcanologists, have "charged and unlocked" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it had to happen, happened as soon as possible. Even before the billions of dollars are thrown away unnecessarily for measures aimed at reducing the production of carbon dioxide, because any very angry volcano, along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can emit it into the air at least a hundred times more than was saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
Thus, forcibly limiting CO2 production makes no sense. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that, with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, any warming is considerably more favorable than, for example, the rapid return of the Ice Age.
If we are aware of this, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us try to adapt the cleanest possible and other changes with which we cannot measure ourselves with the power with the least possible cost.
The repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be a year late
The Krkonoše National Park Administration (KRNAP) postponed the deadline for submission of bids by three weeks to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí. The original date for opening the envelopes was September 20, said Radek Drahný, a spokesman for the national park. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting offers is to reduce the budget from 110 million crowns to 83 million crowns.
“We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, it is the price we expect to be offered. If someone makes an offer that is acceptable, the work will start as soon as possible," Drahný said.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the repair of the museum is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor of the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park administration, the European subsidies of 123 million crowns for the project are not threatened.
The KRNAP administration is not able to select the construction company for the repairs of the museum. The second competition was announced this summer, because in the previous tender all offers of companies significantly exceeded the then estimated price of 65 million. The offers exceeded 100 million crowns.
The museum, which is housed in the former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of a new exposure, is estimated at 210 million crowns. The KRNAP visitor centre should be established in the now vacated building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the exhibitions.
The renovated museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative entrance gate of the Giant Mountains for visitors. The visitor center should provide the most understandable form of information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains and motivate people to discover the mountains and their protection. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The centre will also offer opportunities for concerts, festivals, theatre performances or open-air lectures. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the establishment of a research room or a café.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, preparing second-generation Mirai
The Toyota Mirai should never have been just a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was virtually no hydrogen pumping infrastructure in the world, it still put it on the menu. Not quite standard, the customer really had to go after this car, but no one else offered such a variant at that time.
At an international conference on hydrogen, Toyota chief Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed that a new generation will be coming next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will be priced for hybrids within ten years. Of course, this is related to the development of pumping networks. The future is as much associated with hydrogen as it is with electricity.
The conference often used the word hydrogen with the needs of ecological traffic not passenger cars, but on the contrary large tractors, boats, trains, etc. Simply the means of transport that need to be overcome at one refueling long distance. They can't offer this purely battery-powered version. Toyota could find new outlets thanks to its great experience and long development.
It remains to be recalled that, like Toyota, Hyundai, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover, believes in hydrogen power.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There is not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if you are green, then you are among the types of warm. When choosing a new red lipstick, put in the first place just on the division based on the undertone. In the next one, take into account the texture.
If you are a woman with a cold undertone, then lipsticks for purple, plum, cherry or mauve are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of a warm skin undertone, choose lipsticks. You can tell by their tend to orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
It may happen to you that some veins look green and others look blue. In that case, congratulate yourself - you do not have to look at the undertone and you can focus only on your color preferences.
Purposeful slander? The zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
The last time at the end of this month. The management of the city attributes this to the gossip that swarmed around the former director of the zoo and veterinarian Václav Poživil, that he purposefully killed the exotic animals he took care of. For example, it was the female rhino Zamba, the elephant Kalu or the orangutan Ňuňák.
The city council has therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for a zoo with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns without VAT and for the Municipal Center for Animals in Need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns without VAT," said municipal spokeswoman Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that the city is thus announcing a competition for veterinary services for the third time. "Dr. Devit must have explained the unfounded suspicions. I consider it an outrageous dehonestation of such a quality expert," she remarked.
Experts specializing in exotic animals are very few. "It's definitely not pleasant. The zoo is still providing veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contracts cost the same money. "The garden, however, must comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of financing," zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská explained.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which the Jane cheetah was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on anonymous slander on his person. He didn't answer phone calls or respond to SMS text messages yesterday.
As for the contract for the zoo, some veterinarians think that in the zero interest of it there is not necessarily a concern about similar purposeful accusations, as in his case, but simply little awareness. For example, the veterinarian Jiří Král has not heard of it. "It's your first time hearing this. No one approached us. Such a thing will, I think, spread quickly," he added.
The new Metro architect will oversee the D line, bringing the experience of the London Underground
The Prague transport company has chosen an architect to oversee the shape of the metropolitan metro. From October, she will become Anna Švarc, her primary task will be the appearance of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing station. According to her, the metro can not be viewed only as a transport construction, traveling underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who participated, for example, in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, won a tender launched by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to it, 14 other candidates participated in the tender. "Part of the selection process was a cover letter and a resume. Apparently, my previous practice from London decided, where I created an aesthetic manual for the local metro in a team of three people," the new metro architect explains. It was also possible to decide her practice from the Institute of Planning and Development of the Capital City. Prague.
The metro does not perceive only as a traffic-efficient construction. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have the idea of how the metro will change, how the space will improve. However, how it will be done in reality, I will only find out in the coming weeks, when the transport company introduces me to its ideas," says Švarc.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations, the aim of which is primarily to maintain the context of all stations in case they are reconstructed," the design manual explains.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal or whether it can be covered by a personality, I really do not know yet," concludes Švarc.
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, the public pieta will be on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died at 86 on Thursday, will take place Monday night at Paris' Montparnasse Cemetery. This is reported by French media, citing the Chirac family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon during a piety in Invalidovna, Paris, where the coffin with Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Elysée Palace announced.
Crowds of people have been streaming into the presidential mansion since Thursday evening to sign the book of condolences, according to AFP. This will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared a state of mourning.
In the meantime, there are other reactions from the world and from France to the death of the former mayor of Paris and the president from 1995 to 2007, which Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today called "the French in the true sense of the word."
Chiraca was remembered, for example, by the Japanese, because the politician was known for his love of their country and sport sumo. The news of the death of the former French president has appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sports newspapers, the French press notes.
The Tribal Art Museum on Paris's Quai Branly Avenue, which Chirac founded, will not collect admission for ten days in honor of the former head of state.
The opening of the Pumpkin World delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leština (Havlíčkobrodsko) - The farmhouse in Nová Ves near Leština in the Havlíčkův Brod region opened the Pumpkin World for more than a month today. Decorations stacked from thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins dominate the garden of the mighty orange pyramid. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, begins a week later this year, as the pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of the Pipkova family's fields have matured longer. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told the Czech Press Agency today.
They grow many types of pumpkins, but for the last two years they have not enjoyed the weather. This year's harvest has been delayed and some species have not come out. "As usual, we have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some species did not succeed for connoisseurs," she said. Nevertheless, it is possible to choose from several types on the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and paving decorations through pumpkins for cooking hokaido or oblong "spaghetti" to ornamental gourds of various colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers hand-dig the plants and harvest their fruits, cutting off the scissors from the stem of the pumpkin. The pumpkin world has been open to Pipka regularly since 2010, the previous years attracted thousands of people. The decorations from the pumpkins are complemented by attractions made of straw or maze from logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farm. It will be open daily until November 3.
Details of the event are on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, even pumpkin muffins or juice. Other options for adjusting the pumpkin in the kitchen are called by visitors themselves. "A lot of cookbooks have tried their recipes, we will also be inspired," said Pipková. She pointed out that some pumpkin housekeepers also load the sour like cucumbers.
The meal voucher is planned by the ministry from 2021. Taxes do not change anything
The Ministry of Finance is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for food directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, a quarter of employees, or about a million people who do not yet receive food vouchers, will also be able to support meals.
According to the chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators, David Rýc, however, a number of small companies that do not have a canteen or food vouchers provide their employees with meals, for example by importing food or agreeing with restaurants.
"The essence of the intention is that we do not change anything about the tax benefit. It will also not be health and social insurance," Ms Schiller said on Friday. She added that the limit for the employer's maximum contribution applicable as a tax rebate would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the price of the meal voucher. The remaining part is paid by the employee, in some cases they are also paid by the employer, but without a tax credit. The most advantageous value of the meal voucher for employees and employers this year is 123 Kč.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championship
The kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and the canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Water Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifying, Flashy fifth and Fisher eighth. The other three Czech representatives will be aiming for a semi-final start in Spain in the afternoon's corrective qualifying run.
Vavřinec Hradilek failed from a strong kayaking group, who received a fifty-second penalty for an incorrect pass of the goal at the beginning of the ride. On the contrary, he and Snitch can already rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-final.
"I set myself the goal of going down the first ride to the 30s, which I managed to do. Not that I don't care how I turned out, because on Sunday I start very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to have a better starting position," Přindiš said, appreciating his well-being in Seu. "Before the patrol race, I felt the worst in the 14 days we've been here. But then it was good in the race and better today. The whole time is beautiful here, nice races, the spectators came, so fine," he smiled.
The sparkler was also satisfied. "In qualifying, you don't want to make an unnecessary mistake. I didn't really like it in the first wickets. Then I did a great, no problem, and I knew I had a mileage, so there was a second mistake when I wanted to go down straight and turned the erk. Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. The form is, we'll see how it goes next," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised the fact that they will go to the start on Sunday at the end of the semi-final block. "I'm not an early bird, it's also cold in the morning, and when you're here for eighth, it wants to have a jacket and a sweatshirt," Přindiš said. "Overall, it takes an hour and a half to make the semi-final, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," said Flash.
Of the three Czech singecanoists, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the 20th, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. "I went to the top of the way, in the middle passage I felt like I wasn't in time and I wasn't going according to plan, but I was able to get into the comfort track I wanted to follow. I made two nudges and I'm just behind the winner with a clean time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals," Fišerová praised herself.
Coal will give way to gas and core. Renewables won't cover up demand, says European ExxonMobil chief
Renewables will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to inappropriate climates, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with HN, Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the U.S. group ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest oil producers, said this. At the same time, he mentions that large storages, which could later store unused energy from days when there is enough sun and wind, are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobile center in Prague, where 1200 people work and whose task is to support the company’s business activities and provide logistics and other services needed for the company to function.
Declaration of the end of the right in the Chamber of Deputies or What "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
There have been reports in the media and comments recently about the forthcoming coalition of the aforementioned parties. Many applaud that the "right" is finally getting together, but I'm rather asking why these parties still call themselves right-wing.
Apart from the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it does not matter what the entities themselves refer to or what designations are parroted by the mainstream media. The ODS is hardly central in its average of the top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly the party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its left-wingness, and so hypocritically referred to as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that, by its conception, ideology and voter targeting, basically blends with TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU even labels itself as a centre-right for a long time - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say themselves.
Do you feel like I've taken all of the water clean? No, I'm based on the real political action of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is the freedom of the individual, the free market and the minimal interference of the state in the life of individuals and the economy. How do these general assumptions of the right-wing party fulfill? How many laws cutting people’s freedoms by the salami method, raising taxes, confirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing the link to the socialist EU or supporting environmental and gender madness in recent years? A lot, a lot. Not their own stickers, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wingness.
I would not be surprised by the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, on the political map it simply belongs to each other and except for Christian or homosexual and gender aspects in them for voters in the sense of the influence of the state on their lives, I basically do not see the obvious difference. However, the ODS has long been portrayed as the "only right-wing" and, by linking with these three entities, it is already openly revealing its true political classification.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the stickers. Have you noticed how often all these parties quite identically and cheaply refer to the critics of dirigism and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can't they or just don't want to understand that there are many people who don't smell as strong about Eurosocialism and growing non-freedom as an authoritarian regime in Russia? Are they not hiding their complete incompetence of argument and the unjust or blind adoration of the EU?
It is possible that in the Czech Republic there is no other chance of greater success than the centre-left policy. Maybe that's the kind of union voters really want. Perhaps they want left-center politics under the cloak of the "right" because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or can't even identify it). I don't know. I’m not one of those voters.
Unclarified death of a little girl (†8) in the Příbram region: The culprit does not await punishment
Unexplained cases are called "moments" in criminal slang. They are also being investigated if new information emerges after years. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, the criminal Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague’s Prokop Valley, which was 12 years old. "The 1955 case? That's going to be hard, very hard. It would like to find a file for a start, it may no longer exist, talk to those who investigated it. Hope is always, but it would be really hard," Markovic says.
Under the previous regime, the public was not very informed about violent crimes, but according to Markovic, this does not mean that they are being investigated laxly. "It's always mattered to specific people," the criminal thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 50's of the 20th century can be destroyed, although unsealed cases should not be shredded.
Lucie White's father didn't cheer for her at all. You won't believe what she was supposed to do for a living!
Those who do not know that the national treasure of Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession of seamstress and her own name Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glassworks!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love of singing was born when, as a little girl, she performed in a cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the foamer still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother was sitting. That's when the singer was born in me," she confessed to the Impulsu radio.
But her father was a little worried about her daughter's future, and he advised her to go down the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"Dad always said, 'Craft girl, craft. Walk your feet on the ground!' He even asked me if I wanted to go to the local glassworks. The glassworks doesn't work anymore, I do. I'm a trained seamstress and I make various rosaries and pendants from beads at home, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs for money," she added with a laugh.
The launch of the new toll is not under threat, reports the Kremlin. There is a change of operator in the game
The Ministry of Transport on Friday began preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. It is a back-up plan that the state would use if the current toll treaty were finally repealed. In addition, the state is preparing another provisional solution if the tender could not be completed in time. This was stated on Facebook by Transport Minister Vladimír Kremlík (for YES).
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) banned the performance of the toll agreement between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with an annual postponement. The Ministry will file a decomposition against this.
"The launch of a new toll system is not compromised. Starting today, we are launching the preparation of a new transparent procurement procedure, the subject of which will be the services of the operation of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," the minister said.
The state would thus look for an operator of the currently prepared toll, which will be launched from this December. It would not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor the use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to Kremlík, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on the experience with the toll tender so far, I am deeply convinced that the Office is wrong and that within the 12 months stipulated by it it cannot objectively prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to the new operator," he said.
In addition to the new procurement procedure, the resort will also prepare a provisional solution that would solve the toll collection for a temporary period until the state has found a full-fledged form of solution.
The state is not likely to take advantage of the offer submitted to it in recent days by the current administrator of the Kapsch toll. The Austrian firm offered to operate the existing system in case the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that it believed a back-up plan would not be needed. The Ministry will therefore file a decomposition against the decision of the Antitrust Authority.
On Thursday, the Office issued a decision banning the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will not take effect until a year after the decision of the Office is legal. This is not final and may be brought against him by the President of the Office. Both the Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.
Last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator was won by the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch, who failed in the competition with an offer of more than 13 billion crowns, protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract.
I still see myself as a boy who's just looking around so far, says Jan Cina
"That was a big school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with an afro dance. The way I have something Romani in me after my dad, it completely enchanted me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
A much fresher memory than the first step series has the role of a painter in the new film Národní třída. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have attracted him a lot. "The work was challenging, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but fun at the same time. It was filmed on Národní třída, where I was driving as a driver. There was also a lot of filming in the Southern City in Prague," he said about the Czech-German co-production.
Although he is nominated for the Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the highlight of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a guy who's just looking at it. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far in front of me," he revealed, not even thinking about the thank-you speech in case of victory. "Not really, but as a kid, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined me speaking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To like each other and to perceive problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the awarding of the Czech Lions, when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes, and the red carpet was slippery, too. So it didn't take long and he was lying on the ground. He was able to make it a priority. He had a workshop on Vančur's stairs, where he taught how to safely fall down the stairs at VIP events."
The Děčín Zoo rejoices in the small macaque
"Our group currently has seven members. Her youngest member came into the world on August 17, was born female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father is the male Hitam. For the first days after giving birth, the female wore a baby tightly pressed to her body, and for a long time she did not want to show the world whether she gave birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, however, the youngster began to gradually postpone it for a little while, and the nurses already know that it is a male," zoo spokeswoman Alena Houšková said, adding that the Děčín Zoo has successfully reared 12 chicks of this species.
Macaques are the so-called endemics of the island of Sulawesi, that is, they do not live elsewhere in the world in the wild. A typical feature is the black coat and plume on the head, according to which they have a name. Macaques live in rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, it feeds on plant and animal food. The diet is dominated by the fruits of forest trees, which are complemented by flowers and leaves. It solves the need for protein by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
"Apart from the natural enemies, which are the pythons, everything else is written down by man. Locals hunt macaques as a favorite prey with delicious meat and for fur. It is also fatal for these animals to burn and fell the rainforest," the spokeswoman added.
Germany reports the first case of the outbreak with West Nile fever from a mosquito on its territory. Does this have to do with climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also carry malaria.
Germany on Friday reported the first case of a man infecting a West Nile fever on German territory after pinching an infected mosquito. This was reported by the DPA. Until now, all patients have contracted the virus while traveling or contacting sick animals. According to experts, the breakthrough case of the disease is related to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said a seventy-year-old man from Saxony had contracted the virus. The disease had a serious course and because of inflammation of the brain was treated in a hospital in Leipzig. He is now healthy.
The West Niles fever virus was first detected in 1937 in Uganda. In the meantime, it has spread to vast parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in the 1990s to the United States. Its carriers are mainly birds and mosquitoes who become infected with their infected blood.
Managers of state-owned companies are to newly go through the selection process. The law will be able to be circumvented, the opposition says
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said Zbyněk Stanjura, chairman of the ODS parliamentary group.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes to prevent the opaque distribution of functions in the future - critics talk about traffic - in state-owned companies. Newly, candidates should go through the selection procedure at the given ministry and will also be judged by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution that, for example, the ODS does not like, because it will supposedly allow ministers to make excuses that the selection committees are to blame for the possible poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the Committee on Ministers will not be binding. The new document has yet to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Přerov: Driver crashed near village Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight stretch between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old chauffeur of the fabia couldn't handle the shove and drove off the road. The car rolled over onto the roof and he was left wedged under it. He did not survive the injuries.
"According to the initial information found on the spot, a passenger vehicle driving in the direction of Kokory outside the road, where it rolled over on the roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," police spokeswoman Miluše Zajícová told news server Novinky.cz.
And where are the audience? Doha cannot be London
At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, as pilgrimage to Doha has voluntarily and consciously renounced the thrilling atmosphere prevailing at the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of the Dauha skyscrapers invite you to "the biggest sporting event of 2019." However, fears about how dignified her backdrops will be are growing.
"Tickets as a target are sold out for all evenings," the organizers argue.
But that's too little.
The upper gallery of the Khalifa stadium with a total capacity of 40 thousand spectators is already covered with colorful sails, on which the flags of 209 participating countries are also depicted. Athletics has gone to territory in Qatar where it has no roots despite the Diamond League's annual meeting.
Let’s not be surprised that last week only 50 thousand tickets were sold for ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari ries, i.e. in the amount of less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling up the uncovered parts of the grandstands at least halfway. That is why, according to sources of the British newspaper Giuardian, they are reportedly (albeit the organizers themselves deny it) hand out free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, and also to children. Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF Athletics Association, said: “This is how we can inspire future generations.”
The wealthy Qatar has previously won world championships in handball and cycling, after athletics comes football in 2022. The financial offers of the oil power will always be lucrative for wealthy sports federations. This is the reality of today’s sports world.
But even if we accept it and ignore the absence of fans at the stadium, we will not be able to resist a purely sporting sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor world championship of athletes in the Arabian Peninsula should have timed the IAAF leaders better - and for another year. The extremely late term, forced by the climate, crashes the entire schedule of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally start for athletes already in October.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for this at least with technological innovations, with the help of which it promises ultra-modern and attractive mastery. That it's just 37 degrees? Already, the area of the stadium is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built in the blocks, are also supposed to bring the TV viewers closer to what happens in athletes in the hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.
Sparta is really packed this year, acknowledges Hradec Bek Nedomel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will go in Friday's game against the club where he recently worked. However, the former Spartan is convinced that his team-mates will be the same, although they have never worn the Prague club jersey.
"Against Sparta, everyone wants to pull out," says Hradec Králové bek before the game of the 5th extraleague round.
Hradec Králové will try to stretch its winning series, which currently consists of three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen came on Sunday the most appreciated fans, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice.
“We can’t watch the games that were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them in the same way, if not better," the defender from Hradec Králové points out.
They should not even look back on last year's balance with Sparta. They lost in three of the four games, taking the points only once after winning in Prague after an extension. In addition, Sparta's management brought in some significant reinforcements in the summer and expects a return from the team among the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what we're going to talk about is really busy this year," Nedomlel admits before the first game of the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies. It responds to an instruction from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which is seeking to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and then the bank to pay suppliers of the oil firm with cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying a proposal for the central bank to count cryptocurrencies into foreign exchange reserves that are now close to a minimum in 30 years. Citing information from four sources, Bloomberg reported.
The sanctions imposed by the United States against President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This has further exacerbated the country's economic crisis. The current crisis is one of the most serious in global comparison, which has forced officials to use a mixture of different ways of moving money. While Maduro's efforts to launch the world's first state cryptocurrency have failed, ongoing efforts to exploit digital currencies show how desperately the government is trying to find ways to circumvent restrictions.
Neither the Venezuelan central bank nor PDVSA responded to the request for comment.
It is unclear how PDVSA came to its own bitcoins and ethers, nor how much value it owns these currencies. The business is having trouble getting payments from customers by conventional channels because large banks are unwilling to trade with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the firm received most of the payment of 700 million dollars (16.6 billion CZK) in Chinese yuan because the parties failed to find financial institutions that would allow the transaction.
PDVSA may not want to sell cryptocurrencies in the open market because it would require it to register on the stock exchange and submit to in-depth scrutiny, the so-called due diligence. Instead, it wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank and paid with it to the entities to which PDVSA owes. Oil firm officials believe the central bank is less exposed to any obstacles that could arise when paying with cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized Internet ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are allowed without the need for an intermediary. Few banks engage in digital currencies because of money laundering issues and client information related to them and complicating compliance.
After the 2018 debacle, cryptocurrencies are experiencing a return to the limelight this year thanks to the expectation of their greater adoption by institutions and Facebook’s plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. They remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen nearly 20 percent in the last four days, but has a profit of about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Neckermann cancels all flights, it concerns five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of both British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., acting under the brand name Neckermann Travel Agency, did not file an insolvency petition," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue to cancel the planned departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from September 26 to 6. October.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights affects about 500 clients. According to him, 800 Neckermann clients who are currently abroad will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic by their planned flight is ensured.
The travel agency admitted that some clients had been asked to pay for their stay. "In this case, it is necessary for clients to contact the CK Neckermann SOS line immediately," Šrámek added.
The collapse of Thomas Cook occurred on Monday. In August this year, the travel agency reached an agreement on the basis of which creditors were supposed to put 900 million pounds into the company.
She was to receive half of the sum from the Chinese firm Fosun Tourism. It was supposed to be the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, information emerged on September 20 that creditors had demanded from the travel agency to gain a reserve of 200 million pounds, otherwise the deal was falling. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
Under the bridge, someone killed a non-conflict homeless woman. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder occurred sometime in the early evening until the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is this time that the police appeal for possible testimony relates.
"Some of the drivers who drove along the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or along the street Pod Krejcárkem could shoot the killer, for example, on a dashboard camera. Maybe a witness could have just seen him and described him. In short, we will welcome any testimony to this case and accept it on line 158," said Jan Daněk, a spokesman for the regional police headquarters.
According to a spokesperson for Daňek, the murdered homeless woman was non-conflict, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. There was a woman at the scene. "She most often moved around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she had large blue shopping bags with her," Daněk added the description of the victim, who could also help the witnesses.
Slovaks succeed, only pay fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association has succeeded in appealing against the closure of the stadium for fan racism. The team was originally supposed to play the European Championship qualifiers with Wales without spectators, instead the association will only pay a fine of 15 thousand euros (about 387 thousand crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of fans during a recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting wards of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2:1. Both associations closed the stadium for one match and Slovakia fined 20 thousand euros, Hungary 67 thousand euros.
Slovaks were only fined 15 thousand euros for insulting political shouts after the appeal. The closest match of the national team in qualifying for the European Championship with Wales 10. October in Trnava will be made available to fans.
Basketball players for the under-17 World Championship medal did not reach, finished fourth
Even the third World Championship 17th was won by the American women, who beat Spain narrowly 77:75 despite 40 points from Spain's Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the start, but we couldn't keep it up because they overwhelmed us under the basket," said captain Karolína Malečková. "Playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, thanks to two threes took the lead 8:0 and dominated the whole first quarter on the course. At that point, it seemed to repay the opponents defeat from the base group of 85:88 after the extension. But the referees whistled 15 fouls at half-time and helped Hungary to return to the game with a 12:2 cord.
"I'm convinced that it was enough to put two more three baskets, run on 20 points and we wouldn't let it go anymore. But instead, our mistakes came. I don't care about referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent to catch on," coach Richard Fousek said.
"It wasn't the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are warriors, they didn't release anything and fought to the end. The opponent was very good,” he added.
The Czechs kept in the game especially Petra Holešínská accurate shooting from a distance and pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the best Czech shooter had a problem with fouls and a large part of the third quarter was missing on the pitch. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they already kept, despite the Czechs fighting until the last seconds.
"For us, the first five games were very challenging, we turned the matches around in a narrow rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. Against Spain, it was obvious that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take. Because of the physique, we weren't consistent in defence. We didn't play a quick counter-attack, we missed the rebounds. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don't bring everything together, you'll find it hard to win," Fousek added.
He believes his trustee is expecting a promising future. “In two years, the girls have been able to win the Youth Olympics, be second in the European Sixteen-Year Championships and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, it is a quality team with a good character and we need to continue to work with it and develop talent. Now he's up to the federation, which coach they'll be assigned in the higher categories," Fousek added.
The end of political traffic? The new law, according to critics, will not help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to play the role of ministers to take responsibility for the election while continuing to choose their candidates.
Greater transparency in selection procedures for posts in state-owned firms - this is one of the objectives of the nomination law. 119 members voted in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of YES, the KSČM, the Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned firms will have to go through the selection process before the government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation to the minister binding. That didn't work out in the end.
Citizen Democrats and the SPD movement fear the nomination bill will record ministers. "Newly, the minister will be able to hide behind some decision of the commission and thus will not have a clear transparent responsibility," said Tomio Okamura, the SPD chairman. The vice-chairman of the ODS, Martin Kupka, speaks similarly.
The Government Committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, indebtedness, a minimum age of 25 years and the main selection criterion should also be expertise.
The bill will still have to go through the Senate, and then the president will get it for signature.
Tough competition for the Škoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed is betting on a rich equipment, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult to classify model. It is clearly one of the compact SUVs, but does not offer all-wheel drive. This item leaves the larger sibling Sportage, which is such a direct answer to cars like the Škoda Karoq, the Opel Grandland X or the Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, XCeed also bets on more dynamic body shapes, which by sloping the rear can remotely remind the world of SUV-coupé, popular in this part of the market especially among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, XCeed can not be included only alongside plastered versions of classic compacts, which include, for example, Ford Focus Active. In contrast, the Koreans made a much larger number of changes to the bodywork, so those who do not want to see Ceed in the shapes of the novelty may not even see.
Unlike the compact hatchback or the Ceed estate, the XCeed also offers exclusively with turbocharged engines, so do not expect the basic atmospheric fourteen hundred. The XCeed starts with a turbocharged litre and also offers a supercharged 16,000 with 150 kW, reserved for siblings with the GT version. Don't expect a sports level here. Turbodiesel 1.6 CRDi is only available in a mild-hybrid design, that is, the combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps with reducing consumption and emissions. From 100 kW it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
Soon, the offer will grow with a plug-in hybrid, a variant that travels about six tens of kilometers just for electricity. The battery can also be charged from a normal socket.
Simona Krain: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucia White!
The day before the baptism of the calendar Fuck The Age, Simona Krainová posted her latest photos of herself completely naked! "I was a little worried about people condemning me, that I was taking pictures naked at my age. I'm a very shy person. But so far, I've only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want to, you can have a strong figure even at 46. Of course, there's hard work and renunciation behind it, but there's no other way.'
"With Lukáš Dvořák we took about three thousand photos, selected about a hundred and there are twelve in the calendar, so the rest is still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked," said the model, who came to her baptism very exposed.
She wore an extended jacket from Bernhardt and shorts under it, but they could not be seen, so it looked like she had forgotten the bottom. Daily running has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so pleased with the success that she kissed at the baptism of everyone she met. Husband, friends, even Slavica Lucie Bíla.
The car-tuner brought the voice of the digital soul
All you know about obesity is wrong, the headline proclaims a long text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. The provocative explanation then says that the medical community has for decades ignored the facts of obesity and waged a fierce (and unnecessary) war against overweight people, which not only marked public opinion, but also ruined a lot of lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes puts forward right at the beginning is the fact that from knowing and knowing the facts to putting into practice, there is often a very long and tiring journey. He mentions the case of the scurvy, when some captains had already handed out lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the seventeenth century, believing that they would prevent such diseases. However, the British Navy has withdrawn from the practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear influence of fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take this into account. Even seat belts existed long before the invention of the car, but it became mandatory only in the 1960s, as well as the first confirmed death in connection with asbestos dates back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every discovery in the field of public health - and no matter how significant it was - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices and financial stimuli within the society into which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and around one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obesity. Today, more Americans live with obesity than with breast, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and HIV cancer combined.
Obesity is seen as a personal failure of an individual who is said to be burdening the health sector and reducing GDP. The fear of thickness is so great in the population that Americans today spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. The truth is, diets don’t work. In 1959, research showed that 95% to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on the diet gain more than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes further describes the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. Personal meets here with a systemic one, when, for example, in the faculties, when teaching future doctors, he devotes himself to the issue of nutrition only 19 hours from the whole study. Which, at a time when the 60 calorie process that Americans take, comes from ultra-processed food - that is, too much processed food.
The stigmatized obesity, in turn, is illustrated by reports from offices where overweight people usually experience shorter check-ups, doctors approach them with less empathy and consider them more problematic patients.
But being overweight is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes, since 1980, the share of obesity in 73 countries has doubled and increased in 113. And in that time, no country has managed to shrink and stop this increase. Absolutely none.
The Brno Grand Prix? There is a risk of ticket price rises
The most expensive item is the listing fee every year before the Grand Prix. This year there were about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno during the Grand Prix will spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less offset the costs associated with organizing the event, including the listing fee," said Petr Pelc, an economist.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno doesn't have that many of the world's tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors from abroad. It is important for Brno as well as, for example, the Tuřany airport or the exhibition centre. And these are projects that are supported by public money," the economist added.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: 686 million crowns
- profits from the past five years: 682 million crowns
- problem: lack of money to hold, increasing listing fee for promoter company Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in the price of tickets
- current situation: negotiations on a new contract to organize races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration Filip Hrůza, the organizers now have to evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix is draining money from public budgets for other matters. To some extent, however, it is a political, and not an economic, question," he said.
In the future, the cost of a motoring event may be even higher. In the game, the variant of increasing the listing fee is almost double.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst-case scenarios are fulfilled, I am afraid that it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount," admitted Brno Mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As the daily Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties with raising money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that the ad must be placed in places that do not take up cameras. The selection of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, the company from the same area cannot be the second sponsor," Vaňková explained.
More money can be obtained from tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and tell you what the costs will actually be. And we have to adapt the revaluation of tickets to it," said the Brno opposition councillor for the ANO movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
D5 accident: Truck collision closes highway
The event was reported around 08:00 on the 22nd kilometre in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can drive through a gas station," police spokeswoman Michaela Richter said in the morning. The operation was restored around 14:30. According to Richterová, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the cause of the accident is being investigated by police officers.
Petr Svoboda, a spokesman for the Central Bohemian fire department, said that one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other plastic granulate. "Due to the major impact, the transported vehicles were shifted, which firefighters had to first secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Another 200 litres were pumped out by firefighters. The accident was called in by the staff of the Environment Department of the Beroun town hall due to a fuel leak. The rescue of the crashed vehicles and the passage of the highway was ensured by a private company that extracted even contaminated soil.
Unsuccessful qualifications. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha yet
The World Championships in Doha started with qualifying setbacks for Czech athletics. Diana Mesuliánková dropped out in the 800-meter run and neither Romana Maláčová nor the hammermaker Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place, which surprised her last year in London, failed to qualify.
The start on Friday will be completed by the hurdler Vít Müller and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela Joglová.
Šafránková threw her third attempt at 65.46 meters and fell behind by almost six meters after her high this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her power. To participate in the final, it was necessary to climb the limit of 460 cm.
Mesuliáníková, who reached the championship at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth run-up to the penultimate sixth place and even a time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough to advance to the semi-finals. She fell behind her high by one and a half seconds this year. "It was quite quick for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent there in the corner, which kind of robbed me of my strength. I felt like I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to run again, so it was a little uncomfortable in this. I can't be completely satisfied," the Czech representative said.
She was glad to have at least one opponent in the finish line. "She wasn't really good at it, so every losing opponent was good. But I think it was in fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. The fastest half-maker in the run-up was Winnie Nanyond of Uganda in 2:00.36.
In Doha, the best eight-year-old Caster Semenya of South Africa, who has too high testosterone levels in her body, is missing, but like some other runners, she refuses the treatment ordered by the IAAF rules since this year.
In the 100-meter run-up, American Christian Coleman confirmed his number one favorite, with a time of 9.98 to be the only one below the ten-second mark. His countryman Justin Gatlin, who is 37 years old, has also advanced to the semi-finals. The Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is the performance of 9.86 second of this year’s tables and was expected to face Coleman, who has a performance of 9.81 this season.
The Kubánec Juan Miguel Echevarría, who flew to a distance of 840 cm with the first jump, showed great form already in the long-distance qualification. No athlete in the World Cup qualifiers has jumped that far in the last 20 years. The twenty-one-year-old Cuban leads this year's table with a performance of 865 cm.
French candidate for Oskar Les Miserables to launch Be2Can parade
The Golden Bear and both actor winners from this year's Berlinale, the Cannes Jury Prize and much more will present the 6th edition of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year, the Be2Can festival will also bring a selection of the most remarkable and inspiring, presented by the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's show will be the French drama Les Miserables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French Oscar nominee. The film will be premiered in Prague by two leading police officers of the crime unit, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also the co-writer of the film's screenplay.
This year, Be2Can will take place in Prague’s Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, Brno (Kino Art), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8. October.
The directorial feature debut of director Ladj Ly was shown and awarded at a number of other world festivals after his success in Cannes. At the IFF Durban he won the Award for Best Picture and the Award for Best Screenplay, he was also presented at the IFF in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and will soon also be shown in San Sebastian.
As part of the festival, however, viewers can also look forward to the films Synonyms, Young Ahmed, System Intruder, Goodbye, My Son, Sorry, We did not find you, Ghost City Anthology and the film At the Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will head to the Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, the Czech triumph of the Painted Bird.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
The vote of the upper house of the Canadian parliament has confirmed a well-known proclamation for several days: Canada is taking away honorary citizenship of the former human rights legend, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, has lost her honorary title because of her involvement in genocide against the Rohingya minority nation.
The decision to take Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislative body a week ago, and the senators have now unanimously backed him. "This is the right message for both her and Myanmar and the world," said independent Senator Ratna Omidvar. "We must make it clear that genocide co-contractors here in Canada are not welcome - all the more as honest citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian parliament does not technically change for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The silence of a longtime human rights campaigner on the atrocities committed by Myanmar's army for months on the Rohingya Muslim minority has been unbearable.
The fact that there is an officially organized genocide in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the local government - has completely failed in her obligation to protect her citizens, was recently brought by a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that, as the report says, "shock both the horror of their actions and the huge scale." According to the United Nations, Suu Kyi and her leadership administration have committed complicity primarily by covering up the actions of the soldiers and emitting a protection of a fog of lies around them - for example, that it is a "anti-terrorist operation."
After the elimination of Suu Kyi, five figures remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, 49th Imam of Shiite Muslims and Malala Yousufzai.
The development around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy was also reflected by the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where the profile of Suu Kyi added information about atrocities against the Rohingya and about the parliamentary decision to take her the title of honorary citizen. "We have also muted the illumination of her photo on a table depicting the timeline of the human rights struggle, and we are thinking about replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," museum spokesman Rorie McLeod said in a statement.
The only thing that will remain in the current upheaval of Suu Kyi - at least for the time being - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for a huge contribution to the fight for democracy. "Even though Ms. Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be annulled," Nobel Foundation chief Lars Heikensten told Canada's CBS.
Microplastics have reached the human intestines, a study has confirmed for the first time
Scientists have been confirmed to several years of suspicion. The team, led by University of Vienna professor Philippe Schwabl, published a study that demonstrates for the first time the presence of microplastics in human faeces. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, small particles of plastics measuring between 50 and 500 micrometers were found in the samples of all subjects surveyed. None of the eight subjects were vegetarian, six of them did not avoid sea fish, all drank water from plastic bottles and food packaged in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are produced either directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetic industry, or arise from the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and lemonade; in short, everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the digestive system of man has therefore only been officially confirmed. There were about 20 microplastic particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world’s population will have them in them.
Of course, both lay and scientific awareness suspects that this is not good. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. “This is the first study of its kind and has confirmed what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of the occurrence of microplastics in the human body, we need to continue to investigate what exactly that means for human health," Schwabl says.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of toxic chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, there is no other solution than to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. This, however, will be difficult - the first task facing governments and the authorities will at least stop its steep rise. As far as plastic bottles are concerned, experts estimate that in three years, humanity will consume a fifth more than it does today. The current pace is a thrilling million bought bottles per minute. Approximately eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the seas and oceans each year. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and infests marine digestive systems.
Some states have already stepped in to curtail and other measures, Kenya, for example - under the threat of draconian punishments - has banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering small bans (well-known straws) in the same direction, the domestic Ministry of the Environment is also heading in the same direction. But critics say such measures are pretty, but totally inadequate.
Harry in Princess Diana's footsteps (†36)! Where's Meghan?
Diana was exceptional in that she could catch people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused an outcry when she visited Africa and especially the minefield. The images, wearing a protective suit and a shield on his face, have become iconic. And no one could have guessed at that time that a few months later the Princess of Men's Hearts would breathe her last breath in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Her younger son, Harry, also scored when he went to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to the mine removal station in Diric, Angola, and also put on a special protective suit, looking very thoughtful. He certainly couldn't help but remember his beloved mother, whom he lost at just 13.
Harry gave a speech at the scene, where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which is working to defuse minefields and other explosives in the countries where the war took place. "Minefields are unhealed wounds of war. By cleaning them up, we can help the community to find peace with which opportunities also come," he said, also appealing to the conservation and maintenance of wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopedic center just after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention it on the official Instagram account: "The Duke is honored to visit the place and community that was so important to his mother, get acquainted with their tireless mission and speak to everyone who (Diana) had the impression that they needed the most to be heard, even though the problem was not popular worldwide," the post on Instagram, Sussex Royal, said in a post.
But royal fans may be sorry that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) for such a quest for memories of Diana. Both have had a separate program with Harry since Wednesday, probably to protect them. After all, taking a small baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to put his beloved family at any cost.
Singles. We don't have a certain reproduction, but we don't have to worry
Some words have unfortunate connotations, although they only communicate the state of affairs. The word only child belongs to them. It indicates a child growing up without siblings, but does not sound neutral. "You know, an only child," they say, without any need to add. Interestingly, this feature has been "unique" since ancient times, even from a time when expressions such as demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is required to ensure simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that in Europe today no state achieves this value. France and Sweden are approaching it at the most, but European countries are not guaranteed a simple rate of reproduction of the population. (Within the West, only Israel with an aggregate fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman is out of line.) It's a situation like it's made for alarmism. That's why it's no wonder when the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Maláčová falls for him: "There are almost as many individuals as two-children's families," she said in an interview with LN. But she neglected the devil hidden in detail.
Yes, it is good to draw attention to the problem, rather than downplay or ideologize. For example, as in Germany, where the campaign for more children easily acquires the label of fascism (in the style of "so supported by Hitler"). It is good to be reminded that many pairs of singles are directly planning. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to these decisions (for example, the weak spread of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But in spite of all this, let's point out one thing.
If Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost so many unique people", there is a drop of demagoguery. That statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). It then declined to a terrifying 1.14 in 2000. But since then, it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 child per woman, which is the European above-average. It's not enough for a simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with the alarmism can they take a little bit away.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. To start with, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - a lot of countries have committed to that under the Paris Agreement. The Central American state, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully switch to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis expected to run on electricity.
The official tourist organization says that it already comes from about 95 percent of the energy from renewable sources - in 2017 Costa Rica operated for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks.
The density of afforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rain forests with a diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist draws. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and gives an example to other states in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the U.N. said in a statement.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks, which is a lot due to the small area of the country (51 100 square kilometers). Rainy or fog forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world’s biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls, and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Gentle to the planet. The Night of Scientists begins in Prague
"I would definitely visit CTU in Prague and look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, to which there is no access for the public at any other time," advises the national coordinator of the Night of Scientists, Jitřenka Navrátilová.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would run over to CULS and watch the film Green desert," Navratilova adds. There will also be nine laboratories. The slogan of this year's Night of Scientists sounds "scrupulous to the planet."
The Supreme Public Prosecutor has resumed prosecution of a mother who manipulated her daughter against her father
The Supreme Public Prosecutor Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittal of a mother who has long manipulated her daughter and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of abuse and endangering her upbringing. The regional court acquitted her of the charges, Zeman disagrees. According to his appeal to the Supreme Court, a crime can be seen in a similar hearing.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more concrete definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary also in terms of directing further application practice," Zeman's appeal reads.
Last year, the District Court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty of abuse of the entrusted person and the threat to the upbringing of the child. She and her daughter formed a strong, almost symbiotic bond, even when she was supposed to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative relationship with the father. The situation marked the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to self-harm in the case of transfer to the care of her father.
The Svitava court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman in the appeal proceedings, it is not a crime. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court even after the Supreme Court had already ordered him to make the decision again.
The Regional Court noted that the situation when one parent manipulates a child against another is not exceptional. It is dealt with in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or social protection bodies of youth. Criminal law is rarely the solution.
According to the Attorney General, however, the woman committed both abuse and endangering her upbringing. "The accused acted quite purposefully when she aroused negative feelings about her father in her daughter, and purposefully confirmed these negative emotions. Such behavior not only followed the illegal intention to limit or exclude the contact of the father with the minor, but she had to be aware that this would cause negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," the appeal reads.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case to the regional court once more. The appeal implies that the child is now in the care of the father.
Step down, he called on Schiller for words about Czernin's opposition filth
"I find it completely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government anywhere, much less on the floor of parliament, should enjoy such a totalitarian expression," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir when discussing the draft constitutional action against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes and the draft constitutional action, which the Senate came up with, was thrown off the table by MPs.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There is not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages like taxpayers' money being spent here, empty straw being beaten around. And I even allow myself, I don't use hard terms, one of them quote: It's opposition and senatorial dirt," the finance minister said.
"These expressions were often used by the Nazis to citizens of Jewish origin and by the Communists to their political opponents. It is a totalitarian rhetoric, without a little respect for man and for opinion," wrote the deputy chairman of TOP 09 Czernin, who will face the former first vice-chairwoman Markéta Pekarová Adamová in the autumn.
"I have quoted one of the many reports that I received dozens during the proceedings of the House. Their common denominator was disgust over the constant personal dehonestation that we witness daily in domestic politics and which was also the main motive of Thursday's proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies. The fact that someone relates the expression to themselves surprises me," Schillerová told the Czech News Agency.
Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, a memorial procession were accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 college students in Ayotzinapa disappeared, despite extensive investigations, the case has so far failed to clarify. The students were reportedly to be detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened after that, but according to the investigation, the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, according to APTN.
A memorial procession was held in Mexico City on Thursday, with families wanting to express frustration over the fact that they still failed to find answers and explain their children's disappearances.
But the mostly calm march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals that destroyed everything in their path. The vandals were destroying shops and hotels, not shielding themselves or destroying monuments, setting fires around the city and draining windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything possible to capture it, asking the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
More than 142 people were arrested as part of the investigation, but neither of them was convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, investigators were reportedly supposed to torture the suspects, APTN adds.
Mahulena Bočanová interrupted the annual detox and sins again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided to Lightning that she had quit with alcohol. "I decided during the holidays that I would let my old, run-down body breathe. I've set a deadline forever. I feel very rested, I have a lot of energy and my psyche has improved. I haven't been in a good place mentally lately. I get up better, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, more money.'
The annual abstinence was enough and the actress again found her way to alcohol. "Sometimes I have bubbles or good wine, but I don't drink what I used to drink. I'll have one drink and have fun until morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also enjoyed non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," boasted Mahulena, who still forms a couple with the Brno-based entrepreneur Petr.
Bočanová also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will newly join the series Ordinations in the Rose Garden. "I'm embarrassed for the first two shows, I was really bad, I was overreacting. But it's getting better," the actress smiles critically.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He mainly wishes him peace
The presenter and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) will not be afraid of any questions. In your show Call and Write to the boss, he speaks publicly on various topics. And he's no stranger to the tabloids, which he's sparkling and humorously glossing over. Although this time he wasn't laughing.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karel got sick and said it fairly without the tabloid journalists having to poke around. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all appreciate Karel Gott immensely. And I would, of course, wish him successful treatment and especially peace! The calm he needs now," the owner of Barrandov TV said.
"I wish the media would let him go. And she waited for the news that the Master himself decides to provide to the media. I don't like the different statements that his old acquaintances and celebrities think about his health. And for our media, I can say that we will only deal with his illness and his person if he expresses interest in it himself. I think other media should consider a similar approach.”
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
"It turns out that young Czechs have a little more confidence in their knowledge of finances than reality. In this case, women and respondents without graduation had a significantly greater proportion of bad answers," said Jaroslava Palendalová, director of the KRUK.
Men and young high school students or undergraduates believe in their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial matters from parents (37 percent), self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and in the third row from teaching in school (21 percent).
Questions about finances are consulted with parents primarily by women, while information on the Internet is sought rather by men. Obtaining information on finances from parents prevails in all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospectuses of financial institutions, professional journals and publications have virtually minimal influence.
"Again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent authority in all the main areas of life, is shown. Therefore, the key level of financial literacy is parents, who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring," Palenda said.
94% of young people prefer savings and investment.
Clearly, young people are faced with the question of whether it is better to save and buy, for example, your own house or apartment, or to enjoy and spend money, without savings and your own housing.
The strategy of savings and investments in fixed tangible assets is granted to 94 percent of respondents. This applies across all age categories of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current level of personal income.
The investigation strategy is then one hundred percent held by people in marriage with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income above 30 000 crowns per month want to enjoy themselves.
The hunter was injured in the fall from the sitting, carrying him to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before half past eight in the evening in the peaks at the Devil's Mill.
"It was a very complex and inaccessible terrain, so we went to the injured man with five of our rescuers with proper equipment. At the same time, we asked for cooperation from the Emergency Medical Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found hunters in a selected location with multiple injuries. Immediately it was treated and then gently, but with difficulty transported on the so-called Austrian wheelchair over impassable terrain.
"The transport in the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the crew of the ambulance after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaškovský, the authorized chief of the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service and at the same time the intervening rescuer, a colleague of the hunter was fortunately able to describe in detail where the injured person was located.
"We found it relatively quickly. However, if he had the Rescue app on his phone, our rescuers would have been with him sooner and at the same time he would have known about the accident and his situation immediately dispatching line 155," commented Radan Jaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the activated Rescue app should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
Zeman conservationist - Man straining constitution calls for enforcement of the law
Those who move in a divided society and do not want to go completely crazy will welcome situations when they do not have to cheer only for their own. When he can admit the pluses to someone he otherwise criticizes. It doesn’t feel like it’s just based on pre-assigned stickers. Such situations include a list of severely damaged monuments that President Zeman fencing during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what it is. And who sometimes travels through the Czech Republic, a number of those devastated monuments - from the centers of historic towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farms - he sees with his own eyes. Everyone knows that demagoguery can come to the floor. That if we reproach the town hall for the lack of memory or some horror in the zoning plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatized object whose owner is not traceable. The head of state of local politics calls out: "The section of the Heritage Act allows you to fine owners of objects who do not care about their property." But even if the owner is unreachable, it must be admitted that the president calls for the enforceability of the law. Which even critics of his bending of the constitution should recognize as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of the complex problem. But he stands up for a good cause similar to squatters he doesn't recognize himself. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all swearing, squatters point to a problem outside the current interest. To the fact that this or that building is in a state of disrepair." And let's face it, the president is doing the de facto same.
If you come to the historic center of Jáchymov, you will be amazed how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and tolar mining (for American dollars). Why? It is said that because of the fast-feeding sale of houses in the 90's, officials say. But why is it that seven kilometers away Ostrov, the seat of the Šliks, who coined the Jáchymov dollars, has the historical core nicely repaired? It is good if the president points out these things.
Babiš called for security cooperation in the memorial to the victims of terror
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monica visited the September 11, 2001 Ground Zero memorial in New York on September 27, 2019.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all the states of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said this today in the New York Memorial of the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very moving place," the prime minister said when, accompanied by his wife Monica, he laid a white rose with the names of Lukáš Rambousek and Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2750 dead who were killed by the attack by the hijacked planes on the former World Trade Center (WTC) skyscraper. The WTC towers collapsed after the impact, in their place now a memorial with a name list of the victims.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," Babiš said. The September 11, 2001 attack on the U.S. was described by the prime minister as a reason why the U.N. should cooperate in a unified campaign against international terrorism. In addition to the destruction of the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed a hijacked plane into a Defense Department building in Washington, and planned to strike another target in Washington, apparently the White House and Congress. But the plane crashed when the passengers stood up to the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, where all the states of the world should come together and fight international terrorism in a coordinated manner," the Czech prime minister added.
The Slovenians have also beaten the Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championships
Slovenian volleyball players will play sensationally for the first European Champions title. With the support of nearly 12,000 storming fans in Ljubljana, the reigning two-time world champions beat the Poles 3:1 and are the first finalists.
A decision on who will be challenged in Sunday's climax in Paris will be made on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team was much more compact in the semi-finals than the Polish world champions. They belonged only to the beginning of the opening set and with luck the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players outperformed in defense and of the players in the red-and-white jersey basically scored only a native of Cuba León.
On the other hand, both the packers Chebulj and Urnaut were presented in the home line-up in life form, and also the second universal Štern, which soon replaced the lackluster Gasparini. The Poles paid the price for all the previous matches on this Euros winning confidently, while the Slovenians gained confidence after tough battles in the playoffs with both the Bulgarians and the Russians.
The Slovenians lost to the Poles in the Olympic qualifiers in GdaŇsk 1:3 this year, but they were defeated at home. But now the sold-out Ljubljana Arena Stožica will leave. Already after today, however, they have a certain second medal in history, in Paris they can improve the unexpected silver from the European Championships four years ago.
At the previous European Championship, the Slovenians finished eighth, behind the Czech national team.
Technology companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyam's history has been somewhat baked. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist in his most famous book, The End of History, and the Last Man wrote: "What we may be witnessing... is the final point of the ideological development of humanity and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the ultimate form of governance."
Twenty-six years later, we are rather witnessing how, from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, the models of illiberal are more likely to prevail, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism are thriving. The current ninth book by Fukuyam's book Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment is attempting to cope with the onset of these forces. As his interview with George Eaton to the New Statesman shows, many of his former opinions rethink: he argues that the ideas of socialism should go back into public space, and Marx was right about many things. Although he insists that his thought development is still in line with the position of the 1990s, and critics of the End of History and the Last Man are said not to have understood correctly.
“What I was saying at the time was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that it provides peace and prosperity, but people want more than that. Liberal democracy does not even try to define what a good life is. He leaves it to individuals who feel alienated, don't see the meaning, and therefore come together into groups according to their identity that give them a sense of belonging."
In its time, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists who perceived communism as the final stage of history. When Fukuyama is asked how he now perceives the rise of the Socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about the ownership of the means of production, then except when the public's services are in demand, I do not think that will work. But if you mean the redistribution programs that are trying to solve the huge imbalance in income and wealth that we are witnessing, then yes. I don't think he could come back, he should come back. The long period that President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher started, and in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came to the floor, have in many ways had a disastrous effect.”
In the end, Fukuyama tries to calm the current situation, and warns all liberals that even the emergence of new not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Soldiers rehearse, pull down the curtains. China prepares celebrations at the scene of the massacre
The army rehearsed the show on recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close and residents near the square were ordered to close the curtains. Military vehicles were rolling toward the square and warplanes were circling the sky.
Several Chinese have told Reuters they are proud that their country will display its military strength. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would upset other states.
Apparently, she was referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are approaching. But they may also be concerned in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, in which thousands of people repeatedly demonstrate against China-appointed administrators.
The celebrations are also being prepared outside Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen has already put on a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen is located opposite island Taiwan and is one of China’s ten most innovative cities.
A list of forbidden items is growing before the anniversary. It already has drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, radios and radio waves, The Guardian reported. He added that China's popular social network Weibo was erasing "harmful political information."
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the oar) despite all the predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, who is involved in China. "This is a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was formed in 1949 when the Communists, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, won in battle with Chiang Kai-shek nationalists who had retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 60's, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime in Tiananmen Square massacred thousands of pro-democratic protesters from students and workers.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly taken over elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, the mixture of the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and the persecution of the opposition) and (Dicken) capitalism (the exploitation of workers) is now a mixture.
Czechs or children are forbidden to enter. CTIA reveals discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, incorrect information on prices and non-compliance with the principles of fairness of sales.
In one case of discrimination, restaurants in Prague refuse to let smaller children into the business. On his website, according to the CTIA, he writes that the facility is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "At the consumer's electronic inquiry whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child aged four in the restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," Fröhlich added.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to let Czech-speaking people to the table, while the English-speaking person allowed it. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of a consumer, were not allowed to sit at the table in the restaurant and make an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do this," a CTIA spokesperson described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. Since they are not yet finalized, the inspection spokesman could not provide further information about the restaurants.
However, discrimination only occurred in a very small part of restaurants controlled in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination mentioned above, it revealed other misconduct in 64 cases. Most of them were shortcomings in compliance with the principles of fairness of sales and non-informing the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspection reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged amounts higher than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, the final fines of 60 000 crowns have already been imposed.
On holiday with a credit card only? NEO account offers ATM withdrawals around the world for free!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have already gotten used to paying directly by card. The main reasons include, in particular, comfort, security, but also the possibility to use travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travelers in almost every corner of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, for example because of work, don't have time to go to exchange money repeatedly to exchange cash. And even "holidaymakers" don't want to rely on the cash to be enough for them. In addition, some foreign currencies do not even have Czech banks or exchange offices. For the NEO account, we have therefore solved this so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs free of charge, wherever they are,” says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communications and spokesperson for Expobank CZ.
Moreover, the payment card is a much more reliable way not to lose your money compared to cash. With the loss of a full wallet, the owner may not wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he loses only his credit card, he can easily block it over the phone or through online banking. Thus, in a quick negotiation, they do not have to suffer any financial loss at all. "Keeping money in a bank account has other benefits in addition to their reliable protection. For a NEO account, for example, it is an interest of 1.6% per year, which is among the highest among current and savings accounts. Its establishment and administration takes place completely online without the need to visit the branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100 thousand euros and the account management is completely free of charge," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone planning to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay by card online, it can be done even at the last minute. However, the ownership of a payment card alone often means insurance protection when traveling. "For example, for embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign trips to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they travel. They often lose any further furnishing," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always appropriate to verify the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it applies to all activities that travelers plan to undertake.
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The advantage of the children's clinic is being built by an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
The Albanian Ledjon Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few people know that she is a foreigner.
In the Czech Republic, hundreds of medics from abroad are studying who could stay and work here. The pediatric clinic in Prague’s Motol tried to obtain some of them.
In order for Tara Hussein Tayeb to arrive at the Motol hospital in Prague around five o'clock in the afternoon, she had to get up a lot. The Kurdish woman with short hair cuts flew to the Czech Republic from Suleimania, a city in the northeast of Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and in the afternoon still treats small patients in private practice. He also teaches at university.
Spilk in par. In Indianapolis, after the first round, he is on the edge of the procedure
After the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis, golfer Klára Spilková is on the edge of progressing to the final rounds. On Thursday, she played two birdies, two bogeys, and finished the opening day at par on the LPGA series. With the result of 72, it is in a split 69th place, which is the anticipated cut.
Twenty-four-year-old Spilk returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month health break and did not make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She had a rest due to fatigue and exhaustion after a passed disease.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament for the European LET series is a member of the LPGA Tour for the first year and has not been doing very well yet. Of the twelve tournaments, she went through the cut three times, best being the 32nd in Hawaii. He is struggling to keep the card for next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was best played by Korean Hor Mi-jung. After the first round, he scores -9 and a lead of two shots in front of three opponents.
The Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast fared well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with moderate growth. The PX index rose 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. It was pulled up by Czech banks, telecommunications company O2 and technology firm Avast. On the contrary, Austrian titles and media companies CME did not succeed. This is according to the results of trading on the exchange website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in a slightly positive territory and eventually, even with a small profit, ended. "However, in the whole week (PX index) lost slightly over one percent," said Josef Dudek of Fio banka.
Domestic banks have partially corrected the declines of recent days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to 803 crowns and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to 72.80 crowns. Shares of Avast appreciated by 0.89 percent to 113 crowns and operator O2 added 0.46 percent to 216.50 crowns.
Kofola's securities grew the most, by 1.38 percent to 294 crowns. The tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares rose to 13 640 crowns, then gained less than a percent.
The securities of the energy company ČEZ stagnated at 520 crowns on Thursday.
The loss was three titles - Erste Bank wrote off 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and insurance company VIG 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The crown weakened slightly against both major currencies. On the euro, it lost four pennies to 25,85 Kč/EUR, to the dollar three pennies to 23,62 Kč/USD. This is according to data on the Patria Online server.
My heart is like a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. I'll just have a few infusions, Zeman joked
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the hospital's director, Miroslav Zavoral, doctors found no "morbid conditions" with the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors at the president's inspection revealed mild signs of dehydration. His problems with low pressure were caused by insufficient watering. "To fix the dehydration of the organism, I will have a few infusions that will get minerals into my body," Zeman said.
According to him, however, the director of the ÚVN stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". The president mentioned in this context that Zavoral received several hate messages for the health check.
According to the president, doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single place on his body. "So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, as if it's not a smoker, the liver works like I'm abstinent, the kidneys are fine too and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The editors of iDNES.cz turned to the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement on her health.
The issue of Zeman's health has become a topic especially at the time of last year's presidential election or in some public appearances, in which Zeman has clear problems with walking. According to Prague Castle, the president is poorly walking due to diabetic multifunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low pressure and is harder to hear. Because of his health, he cut down on smoking.
Scientists are looking for toddlers with a birth defect, called ankle valgosity, into their study
Valgosity (sowing) of the ankles is a birth defect that affects five to ten percent of children. By default, it is treated with intense exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototype shoes that will carry healthy children and children with a diagnosis to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will not have any risks for children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunová, head of research from the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study through the website, where a registration form and all information are available.
The researchers are looking for fifty children diagnosed and fifty children healthy. Of each group, half will always wear health shoes, and half will not.
"The moment when parents should register their child is the moment when they embark on the first separate steps, typically embarking on, for example, the furniture that they stick to when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements over the course of seven months from the first steps of the child, each lasting about 20 minutes, for half of the participants also includes wearing the tested shoes," Gimunová points out.
Pike in a pond, or a relatively prosperous open-air museum?
Babiš chose for his optimistic view statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt. Or a statement that, according to one recent study, our country is twenty-fourth in quality of life from 140 countries.
However, the developer Dušan Kunovský and the architect Josef Pleskot also presented other, not so "pink" data in a television interview on the occasion of the Summit of Architecture and Development. For example, the Czech Republic ranks 154th in the world in the speed of construction proceedings. It may be that the current economic "boom" will leave behind no significant building heritage as it has in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also the slow, non-performing bureaucracy. This is documented by comparative studies in which the Czech Republic is significantly lagging behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
So far, our country has simply failed to make good use of the potential for the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. While it is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, people with a better standard of living will also want to have a place to live, travel modernly and quickly, have quality cultural stands, live without an unbearable environmental burden.
However, in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has not been possible for years to complete the internal and external circuit or to build a high-speed railway or metro to the airport. And Prague does not have a modern, architecturally bold national library, concert hall or national gallery. The reason is not only the absurd tug-of-war about architectural competitions, planning and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservativism, which adheres to the slogan "every bolder change is for the worse".
And when it seems that something more courageous could happen, it will almost certainly be thwarted by conservationists or other somewhat stubborn associations, or politicians. In the absurd drama around the "blob" of Jan Kaplický designed for the new building of the National Library, President Václav Klaus even wanted to join the excavators.
The list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone highway network or start building train speedways, so Germany finally decided to run its runways for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "detour" through Bavaria. In addition, repairs of existing infrastructure are sometimes drowned in the schlendrian. Getting quickly from Prague to Brno is now a puzzle.
Babiš came into politics with a promise that he would "arrange things." When it comes to meaningful investment and the acceleration of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, not much has happened yet. Since 2018, the amendment to the Act on the acceleration of the construction of transport infrastructure has been in force, but we will have to wait for the more extensive positive effects of, for example, easier land expropriation. And the new building law, passed by the government, which is said to be expected to shorten the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will begin, if we are lucky, to apply from 2021. But a lot of people probably wouldn't bet on it.
Uncombed wants 45 million from the state
According to Vladimír Řepka, a spokesman for the office, the Ministry of Justice has received six applications in this context and is now analyzing them. The young man was in prison for two years for assaulting the woman, but the judiciary finally acquitted him.
The appeal in the case was not filed by both the Attorney General Pavel Zeman and the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec Králové Public Prosecutor’s Office accused him of the then twenty-year-old student of the grammar school Nečesaný. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman in the head several times with a log and then took more than ten thousand crowns from her. Her son found the seriously injured woman, her life was saved by doctors of the Hradec Králové hospital.
Uncombed denied any guilt from the beginning. "I'm innocent, and I swear to that. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the injured person, but I am not the perpetrator," said the young man, who did not deny that the fateful day was in the hairdresser. He said he wanted to get a haircut. He left after the woman told him he was already closing. He then turned himself in to the police as a witness.
The hairdresser did not recognize him as an aggressor during the interrogation, but later described him as an attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Králové Regional Court gradually handed down five judgments in the case. At first, he twice found Uncombed guilty and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, and the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Uncombed gradually went to prison twice, but each time after the intervention of the Supreme Court he was freed. After the ordered exchange of the Judicial Chamber, the sentences were repeatedly acquitted, the last of which was upheld by the High Court in March.
However, the President of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, also stated in the reasoning of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but that given the procedural situation, he did not have a better option. He said he rejected the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal verdict, even though her appeals were warranted.
"The problem with this matter is not that there is a lack of evidence, but of their assessment. We believe that sufficient evidence has been gathered in the pre-trial proceedings, which would be richly sufficient in another criminal case for the recognition of guilt," Lněnička said.
However, the Hradec Králové and the Supreme Court viewed the case differently and their opinion would probably not change the further annulment of the acquittal judgment.
Epilepsy has complicated his love of sport, thanks to surgery he has a new hope
For the first time, Honzík's parents noticed that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always looked into the space for a few minutes, immobilized and did not respond to anyone. The pediatrician sent him to a pediatric neurological clinic, where doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy after a series of examinations and immediately put on medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of medications that made him completely stop having seizures. At the age of five, doctors dropped his medication, and because the seizures did not return, his parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to lead him more to sports. He rode his bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing with his sister and friends. At the age of eleven, he had another seizure and it all started again.
Doctors tried various combinations of drugs again, but this time nothing worked, seizures in the form of absences were constantly repeated. Since he always ceased to perceive Honza during the seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped cycling and exchanged downhill skis for cross-country skis and snowboarding. Although the sport triggered a seizure from time to time, he never completely gave up on it. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who was constantly in charge of his eyes to help in case of an emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to experts at the University Hospital in Motol. After a series of examinations, the doctors there concluded that Honza was a candidate for surgery, which removes the bearing from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. "I had to do 2 operations in a row, first the doctors injected probes into my brain that scanned its activity, then they could remove my bearing. It was a hell of a few weeks for me. I just had to lie down and almost not move, the wires sticking out of my head that were connected to the computer," Honza recalls.
The operation was successful and doctors removed the relatively extensive bearing. "The first days after the surgery it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. In contrast to how normally she is alive and communicative, it was a terrifying change, but fortunately everything went back to normal after a few days," the mother describes, adding: "A month and a half after the operation had 1 seizure, but according to doctors, it happens. Since then, he's been without a seizure for 3 months.'
This school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and has started to cooperate with the Company E, with which he travels around schools for discussions about epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is starting to return to sports slowly. "I'm learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well, so that I don't expose my body to sudden stress, which is quite a nut job with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, they will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI of the canoeing triathlon, where patients with epilepsy and health athletes meet and which takes place already this weekend of September 28, 2019 in the Veselská sand pit. But I hope next year, yes.
XXX Lutz can buy rival Kik, authorized by the office. But there's a catch
"The Office for the Protection of Competition has authorised, subject to the fulfilment of structural obligations established in favour of maintaining the effective competition of the concentration of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and by Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia, on the other hand," said Martin Švanda, a spokesman for the Office.
XLCEE- Holding, in addition to the XXX Lutz chain, owns Möbelix stores. If the Kika chain were to absorb, it would occupy too much of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, part of the purchased company must be sold off.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, the transaction must be authorized by the antitrust authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from holding Signa was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kika last year for a symbolic award.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. She faced problems when she revealed inconsistencies in her accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, Jysk and Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The same owner has the Möbelix brand. After the acquisition of the foreign branches of Kika, XXX Lutz will operate more than 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about 114 billion CZK).
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Václav IV with an exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the Roman and Czech king Wenceslas IV, can be viewed today and on Saturday by people in Prague’s Clementinum. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Václav's death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in the showcases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free of charge, it is open for both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
The exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and Library of Wenceslas IV, the library prepared together with the National Archives. The National Archives looks at the written heritage from the reign of Václav IV from the perspective of official documents and the National Library from the perspective of literary works, said the exhibition by its author Jan Vojtíšek.
"Visitors can look forward, for example, to the work on the agriculture of Peter de Crescentiis, which is essentially an encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, i.e. a prayer book of one of the Benedictines of the monastery of St. Jiří at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he said, listing the reasons why people should look at the exhibition.
The Epistles of Peter of Blois will also be exhibited, where the half-figure of King Henry II of England is depicted in the opening miniature of H (enrico). The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's history, who, in addition to two volumes of the Václav IV Bible, also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see the Latin collection of John Wycliffe's tracts from the period from about 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book has been preserved in the Czech Republic from the Václav IV library. According to experts, this library was one of the most extensive and beautiful book collections in Central Europe at that time, because the young king wanted to build a representative library that would be equal to the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library disappeared soon after Václav's death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed in the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. Several codes have been saved. Today, the Austrian National Library owns the most of them.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of a digital library Manuscriptorium," said Martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition called What's Hidden Under the Floor, which presents the archaeological discoveries, will also be open in Klementinum for free.
Kristýna Plíšková has not made it to the final, she is missing her second title
The plíšková environment in Taškent testified, in 2016 she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit and this year she did very well.
After winning with Paolini, Kawa and Kuzhmova, she made it through to the top four.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvanck did not go well for Kristýna. The Belgian kept her serve and broke Plíšková's serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvancková soon took the lead 3:0 and Kristýna failed to reverse, although she finally managed to change one brejkbol. In the last she turned away one swordball, but the second was the end.
Petra Černocká changed her image and she did well! She was rejuvenating in her light hair
The film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her life's anniversary in November, she never looked like a pensioner. And now she's helped it. She changed her image until her colleagues recognized her.
The actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother, who would have her hair interwoven with a gray color, wore settled things and went into the company sporadically. She's always taken care of herself, and the older she gets, the more she can untie herself in looking at her image.
Fortunately, she did not succumb to the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of the skin with the help of good old indulons. And her anti-wrinkle recipe pays off. But now she's changed her hair color and she's completely seen through.
When she came to a social event where celebrities were saying goodbye to summer, no one could get to know Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was still dressed in a yellow coat that brightened her even more.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate that even on the threshold of the seventies they can risk their appearance. And Peter paid off, he looks like a maximum of fifty.
