Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center calls such a fraud a myth, saying that electoral fraud in the U.S. is less common than the number of people who die after lightning strike.
After all, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the U.S. over the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states have responsibility in the U.S. to organize federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been proclaiming new laws since 2009 that make it more difficult to elect or enter the electoral list.
The phenomenon was boomed after the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states were submitted in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photo and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, invalidating the right to enlist on the electoral list on the day of the election, and withdraw the right to vote for citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 election, he did not require any American state to submit an identity order with a photo.
The first state to introduce this demand was Indiana.
The Constitutionality of the Indian Act was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities have been in a hurry to expand this procedure to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported draft such laws in 34 states with the aim of forcing voters to present photo ID cards.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens do not own, i.e. 21 million people in age allowing you to vote, no photo ID issued by the government office of their state.
Furthermore, it does not have an identity card of about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the purchase of the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting mainly young people, members of minorities and low-income people.
25% African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35 000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, are known for their inclination to Democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID card issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote rather Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in the election.
Until 2004, no state had required proof of citizenship in the elections.
The first such request was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have passed laws that stipulate the obligation of voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer a democratic party.
Republican legislators in eight countries supported laws in eight states that cancel voter counts on the day of the election.
In addition, they have restricted the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to enroll.
These limitations have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, about 10 million people were helped by voter enrollment campaigns to register.
However, the measures adopted after 2009 caused a decrease in the record of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican legislators then enacted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for elections in advance.
During the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans made up 33% of the voters who voted in advance, even though African-American voters in the state were only 13%.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of the electorate, who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters opposed the approval of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their vetoes.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, the U.S. attorney general has even intervened.
They have managed to reduce the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 countries adopted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photo.
However, the newly introduced rules will make it quite undeniably difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics speak primarily about bias of the approved laws and see them as an obvious effort to influence the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The 2011 report of the Brennan Center shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College necessary for the victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test sometimes yielded erroneous results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All this increased the hesitancy of men, who were already reluctant to go to the examination at all.
Get tested or not?
We asked two experts for the opinion.
In studies conducted in the U.S., there has been a high level of contamination between the individual groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, noted the different mortality rate among patients who underwent examination and those who did not go to them.
This study also showed after 12 years apart that those who do not go for the examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
Therefore, I recommend an examination from 50 years of age or from 40 years, if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also a more endangered group.
The key is to take the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and species that are inert.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain to the patient the level of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to cure prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus in these cases rather on the active supervision of the disease.
Today, many of the men diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
Rather, we will propose them the implementation of active supervision and in the event of progression of the disease, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly and with greater precision, we are setting criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not.
I recommend undergoing the examination.
However, it is important to pass an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo the examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows it to evaluate for and against the PSA examination.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, the best means of reducing the risks of disease seems to adopt the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved adequately, up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided.
“If everyone quits smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes heredity.
Some percentages also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," spokesperson André Beaulieu shakes his head.
Encouraging figure: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of cancer death drops by half.
Weight
According to SCC, body and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophagus, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
“The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the report said.
Nutrition
This organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid sausages for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet come to clear conclusions.
Studies focused on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
Although one of them says there will be a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks more about increasing it.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly proven.
Mr. Beaulieu continues to insist on how important it is to talk about his fears and precedents from the family with his doctor.
"Submitting an examination doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a valid stir last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And it is also the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "the least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is no one hundred percent certainty among the physicists that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle at our disposal, which closely resembles the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the Great Physical Congress in Kyoto confirms it, but there is still no data to be absolutely sure.
However, suppose it's the Higgs boson, as the risks of error appear to be small, and let's look at what it's all about.
In this world, there is a completely unquestionable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
Furthermore, physicist particles are divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, which obediently adhere to Pauli's principle.
And at the other end there are bosons, obsessed anarchists who value nothing at all - certainly not to this principle, which means that they can easily be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the equipment (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: mesons that we leave unnoticed here, and "strength particles" through which great natural forces spread, and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow related.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as can be guessed.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or a "light particle", which is a "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "cancels" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, similar to a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "excellent" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore one of the bosons, "carriers of force".
A more Stable Field
It's also with the Higgs boson, except that it's necessary to "speak" another field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to its excitation, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen level of the pond, which only a large boulder ripens.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator of the part as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with accommodating beam is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again useful for us to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Neither all particles nor all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, for example, magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on its own on the refrigerator.
And it is still true that all particles do not react with the Higgs field: the ones that do so have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let’s look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Nováková asks, what about all these researches, what will they "bring us"?
From a science point of view, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to investigate any mismatch between observation and prediction of SM.
Moreover, many physicists literally want them to be found, because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge flaws, does not bring any clarification of gravity (smooth!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the cosmic matter (again, dusk!).
However, CERN has not yet found such a contradiction.
Responses
The responses of these researches in the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Novák are very difficult to predict, but the mistake would be to think that there will be none.
Behold: in the very early 60's, the pioneers of the laser in Bell's laboratories had no idea of a revolution that their work will provoke.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (before-bearing beams were pulsed) in 1962, I already said it - the laser was initially considered such a "labric toy".
Just imagine...
In addition, application can also result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle did not plan to do so at first, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and earned him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC must necessarily change our lives, but it means that one really never knows...
Palliative care - The best way to leave life... | Le Devoir
Through his Commission for Dignified Dying, Quebek has recently been involved in a delicate question about the end of his life.
The debate should continue soon and a bill is being prepared at the same time.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoire tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montreal.
The prostate cancer that ate it gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's already seven," he says without emotion in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where the previous day had arrived.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet, or to eat alone.
He looks resignedly at a tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop at him, bring him medication, offer a bath.
Courage to ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of this diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
Hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"All life, one learns that men urinate in standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“It depends on the abilities of the person,” the psychologist says.
In the opinion of a number of people engaged in palliative care, the crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who start a home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who take care of them do not provide them with so-called "healing" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "on suffocation in full consciousness."
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in my life," she says, then consents us to put her on a breathing apparatus.
Still, he is still looking forward to his last visit to his son from Italy in the coming days.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, provides body care with the help of nutrition.
This is the palliative care that is starting if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, one palliative care bed per 11 700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize we're all going to die one day.
Here, life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it's the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, it is possible to give him, for example, a sips of brandy or pepsi, to taste.
Diabetics no longer have to watch their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night they bore Mr. X. a beer who died last night.
This morning, his son will drink beer in honor of his deceased father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," Nathalie Savard, director of the care service, tells Nathalie Savardova.
In Victor-Gadbois home, the days go one after another, but they don't resemble each other.
In addition to the ninety-three-year-old man, who rejoices in the last meeting with his family thoroughly laid out on pillows while toasting him in his honor, a tragically thirty-six-year-old man dies, surrounded by his parents, a wife and two young children after trying all the possibilities to survive.
"For six months now, there are always three to five beds that are intended for people with cancer up to 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martelová.
53% of patients coming to Victor-Gadbois's home come here from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e., to the care that is intended to alleviate suffering as soon as the patient reaches the final stage of his life, whether it is at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Treatment Society, specialise more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental unavailability of health care in Quebec that many doctors specializing in palliative care are afraid of the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto in circulation has been in circulation with peaks in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec medical system is not powerful enough to ensure access for all people to quality palliative care before it is possible to agree to perform euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in huge pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
They are concerned that patients should not ask for death because they are not receiving appropriate care.
At the same time, many oncologists take care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
The hopes of Hélène Richard's survival were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my ondator that I was quiting treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was no longer fighting, telling us.
And yet she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for failing to fulfill their wishes when the palliative scipers were relieved by their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is definitely not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the director of palliative care at the Grand Montreal Society for Home Palliative Care, patients are resisting pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that put the patient to the moment of demise, whether impact or whether the sedatives are given to him permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient we will not relieve pain will have an increasing possibility of access to palliative sedatives.
The sick, who are not given sedatives, always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I just don’t need to give me euthanasia,” it means “I mean you’re going to get rid of the pain.”
The implementation of this report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, construction and public workers, political party lobbyists and experts on the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters are mixed.
This "field" came to Quebec taxpayers very expensive, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has crumbled since we took the crucial measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of the Montreal Police.
Thanks to him, a scandal erupted in 2011 on the basis of a rigorous investigation aimed at embezzling funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which the then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest only after long delays.
The "Duchesneau report" confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque party funding and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he says, "summary has only saved a billion dollars on contracts," when some people kept their instincts in rein in order to gain a stake in them!
The Harbonneau commission "always has brought two mayors to resign," he adds, hoping that she will "dissemple the cunning of some people."
Standing Unit for Combating Corruption Established in 2011
The Standing Unit for Combating Corruption, Established in 2011, is also involved in the fight against its military by government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau's retinues" who have ensured since 2009 that the Montreal "treater of money pipelines" significantly mitigates the inflating of orders...
In recent weeks, they have carried out a number of searches and indicted a number of municipal councillors for fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban municipality.
Another on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest Quebec city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have also been made by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito sparked a sensation by explaining the mechanism of the "system" of public procurement.
During these years, he devoted 3% of the value of the contracts he received in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
After 2000, Zambito was generous in all directions and donated more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing illegally raising funds for former liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money pipelines, the prices of which he exaggerated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very actively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it in great detail before the committee: within ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocket money worth a total of $736 000 in exchange for contracts with money pipelines for which he overwhelmed the price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they had their rewards paid for 30% to 40% overestimated invoices through false extra work.
The mayor's party's organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblas of closing his eyes at the parallel budget that was bringing dirty money into his coffers.
On the basis of these revelations, Trembaly resigned at the beginning of November, thereby ejecting Montreal into a large-scale crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, since 2010 she has advocated for the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters right in the middle of a flourishing real estate business.
70% of money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that he "pulls the threads in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system of contaminated with ants to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
According to her, the process is "painful, but positive".
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but it is necessary to set up our own investigative unit in Montreal and to ensure that these questionable practices cannot be returned.
Like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneu himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but he fears in particular the role of "Members informed about this deceit" if they have not become wet in these cocks!
He estimates that 70% of the campaign finances in Quebec comes from money, and ironically adds: "I've heard it's just a weak decoction of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to the parties to $100, but that will not solve the situation: "Until electoral spending is severely restricted, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system of awarding public contracts and party funding: "Which we can no longer fall; if we focus boldly on the essence of things, we can build again on stronger foundations and with greater control and observance of laws."
If this story denigrated the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends to anyone who mocks it to look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you have set a whole new pace with PSG.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into themselves, or a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day I get next door next to them.
The technical team helped me a lot too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier in matches.
In football, everything goes so fast.
But I don't lose my head.
From my beginnings in the preparation in INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always shifted to the individual levels.
So you are using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti has...
Relegiators from this summer are accustomed to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have the decisive say at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today he does not have equal in the 1. league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
I had a reassuring conversation with him in January.
I had a lot of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In League 1, Lyon took our frontal position.
But we stay in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have made it very easy for the eighth round.
What is your goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group ahead of Porto first so that we can play in the rematch of the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
In order for Paris to become a big European club, it must win titles and go down in history.
This is not the case today.
On the financial point of view, PSG has the means to make this intent happen.
And would it be a big setback not to win in League 1 like last season?
Of course, that would be very disappointing.
We really want to win the league title a lot this year.
We missed a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had what we could do to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it will be successful this year.
Even though big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are also striving for the title, I think we have weapons at our disposal to beat them.
Do you think the media expects PSG too much?
It is not unusual to expect from us a lot given what has been invested here and what kind of players we have.
We totally accept that.
It is a fact that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there is still something that we are reproached in the newspaper, it is not very pleasant.
You ask what more people might want from you.
Of course, you can't win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We try to set the playing style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which has not made it to the eight-finals for the second season, and they also invested large sums!
Given the invested sums, you could expect you to have a lead ahead of the others 15 points!
This offends the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille clubs, who did not fare well last season, have moved with the new PSG to the next stage.
This shows how amazing the League 1 is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say that despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.
It seems as if PSG is relying on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It is good that it is said that there is an "dependence on Zlatan".
That means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's the star of League 1.
Wherever he passed, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both people and players.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is truly special.
This led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to injury, I couldn't play the way I would have imagined.
But I've been through it, and I came out of it stronger.
Today I manage to play good matches in the national team.
And that's what I've been hoping since I took to the national team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our demeanoration exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the national team?
He's talking about results.
In qualifying for the World Championships, we are in a good place.
The coach chooses sternly, is close to the players and can excite for victory.
That was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has reached its goal by qualifying for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is a draw (1:1) from 16. October in Spain with a solid starting match?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have not experienced such a struggle in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (transferable to dollars, euros...) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between pairs of partners.
Thanks to 15 000 computers connected to the network, about 200 000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate first reached a high of $30 ($23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, today it is at the limit of about ten dollars (the exchange rate overview is listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world in exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its virtual finance report, which was published in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money", "computing the dollar and the euro" and the "similarity of ordinary money."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like "credits" used for the procedure in the video game, which a person gets by playing or that can be bought (and sometimes remade).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Every month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all network nodes are depositories of current accounts books, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two electronic addresses by e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The information file related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of current accounts, which is distributed across the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction in this book.
It is done by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers, the solver of which, a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is a phase of cutting the file; i.e., the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then "cut" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes can easily check its correctness.
The transaction is then inviolably displayed connected to the string of all other transactions; any modification would change the fingerprint.
If the user would like to pay twice with the same money in a row (within ten minutes) for fraud, the network confirms only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different fingerprint.
A computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is regularly divided into two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they can be divided into a hundred million, so the margin space is...
The difficulty of the assigned task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rises and downs.
The website that provides services for Bitcoin has been hacked and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
“The crack was used not to the protocol itself,” said Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-fundable money payment company used by the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also checks the money laundering options thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Significant players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, as a WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins do not orbit.
"A huge discounts" were launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a Bitcoin conversion into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payments, but uses a Bitcoin system to verify transactions that make them cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set for merchants where you don’t need to install new terminals or software.
Just communicate the address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, explains Pierre Noizat, who assures that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement of the questioning of hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while before Bitcoin succeeds, but 2013 could be decisive,” he predicts.
In addition, the ECB expects a reassessment of various risks that are considered increased today if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And what next?
French troops have abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobili).
NATO and U.S. troops are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and that the Afghans choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The greatest harm was suffered by people in the Afghan countryside, which we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so have we, for we have lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often rural people who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even when they were joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent aid from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab foundation, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked under aerial escort helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstopfighting procedure between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was then empty and the earth was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their take control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants, which were completely dominated by Al-Ká'ida, but their situation has not improved until now.
Former mujaweeks, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree in an effort to preserve women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries of the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became trafficters, seized state lands that they sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were never even in battle.
From what I've heard in campaigns, people crave a government that thieves won't be made up.
Many young people want to leave as those who have managed to take advantage of American generosity: the capital flight is considerable.
The young are tired of the war and the associated ideology.
During exile in Iran or Pakistan, they recognized the modern world and their benefits captivated them.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; there are currently 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given work, they no longer want to return to the namination of former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that lead her head be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewing provinc militias, which will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should look forward to a certain degree of decentralization, following the example of Western states, but the U.S. wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so that the post of prime minister, which has existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 50's and earlier years.
No industry has been restored, no dam is working, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government infrastructure control would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan possessed vast mineral wealth.
And that only fueled the feeling that the Western states were here just to seize it.
Without energy for processing iron ore ore or copper in place and without means for transporting raw materials through the mountains, however, no mineral extraction can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine and have let international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) explore the vast Buddhist site to preserve the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of imports and exports depend, will need to renew normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: girls' and boy's lyceums, the Department of French at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, the support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the "gaining heart and soul" initiative has been operational, attempting to confuse the difficult task of reconciling aid and military activities, which then served the service of the "civic-arms steps" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but, thanks to the small French NGO, achieved a number of successes in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural restoration in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, involving a number of local workers, helped to dampen uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, aforesting, fruit trees, soil protection and expanding the cultivation area.
What kind of memory do we leave after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions that are very challenging in these valleys, which are often located at an altitude of above 2 000 m.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small farm assistance from the local community in the province of Capepa.
In order to free themselves from the uprisings led by foreign groups, these farmers wish to achieve slight civic assistance in their favor, which would be properly controlled and touch directly.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohammed Morsi has embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all others, that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final wording on the day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been supplemented many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal conjecture.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's ambivalence.
From the opposition's point of view, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium," he continues to "speak his word" and "twipes the law."
His supporters, however, assure that this is a means of contaminating with the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention to clarify the text to the Egyptians after the article.
For the president, it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is torn by protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the US weekly Time, Mohammed Morsi appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially since this hasty-organized vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or I will keep unlimited powers" that should otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special atmosphere, 85 deputies of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text yesterday.
Most of the liberals were absent in the vote.
In mid-Nophraine, not long before the constitution was announced, they banished the door, saying they did not have the opportunity to assert their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have mimicked their move.
In order to achieve a quorum, 11 alternates were hastily replenished yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators further questioned that one of the few disputes revolved around... a prayer hour when some members of the committee were of the opinion that the hours in the meeting room were not properly adjusted.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject matter of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains the same as the 1971 version of the Constitution and stipulates that "Sharia's Unions are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules," which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Phypocrite," argues liberals, who see only the rhetorical problem in this.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They shall focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of Al-Azhar to an advisory role, in particular for the control of conformity of Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "persons called to express their expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are even more stirred up by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"There has been no specific religious consequence for now.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not lumber, but university workers, many of them graduated in French schools," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a job on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "there may be contradictions regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
There is in particular a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic Legal Science].
And in the future, the question may arise as to what extent civil judges are competent to comment on it."
The text approved yesterday, in addition to religious pages, is highly criticized because of the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists there has been a significant reduction in the regime.
Another place of contention: powers conferred on the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by parliament, but by the National Council of Defense.
Furthermore, there will be no banning proceedings with civilians in military courts, as requested by the human rights association.
These associations speak in relation to the text, which they believe is directed against freedom, of its doubts.
The crime of blasphemy is preserved and an insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, according to Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak in a televised address last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, holy sites await Ukrainian tourists, the navel of the world and the sea from a saturated salt solution
The promised land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and intangibility of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Respecting the holy places
Visit the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God’s mercy will come down to all those who enter this “bath.”
And Galilee - instead of the miracles of Jesus: the transformation of water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling with nets.
Here Jesus also appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers will go through the Path of Pain, or the Way of Jesus, the Way of the Cross (Platin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonio - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre on the mountain of Golgotha - to the place of the crucifixion, the stone of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in the place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made a cross to Jesus’ crucifixion.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wall of Lamentations, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then filled.
Take the path to the vertical
The ruins of Masada's fortress remained from a secret shelter from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who deal with mountaineering can get to her on their own.
Others will take a cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus is transported to this ski paradise by tourists from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods reportedly lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can’t visit all of them during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parliament).
In it are stored ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, which were found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and approximately 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel-A Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition, his canvases are widely represented by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In the Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Museum-steam, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with mannequins of spa users and spa zookeepers from that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth a visit to the unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter - and you find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars glistened.
And there are the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve your health
The three main spa resorts of Israel are situated on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each offers swimming pools, aqua parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea you can bathe even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe throughout the year.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the most peculiar sea in the world, located at the lowest continental point on the planet - at the level of 417 m below sea level.
Côte d'Azur water in it is a saturated saline solution that easily keeps on the surface even people who can't swim.
The surrounding countryside is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment with the use of saltwater - brine, and healing mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes to heal your nerves.
Touch the mysterious distant past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them passed the famous naval route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is the place where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they then lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love wandering through the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiace.
It is said that if you cling to the walls in the aisle of "your" sign, happiness will be favorably inclined to you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get a picture taken.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "conquench" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully renovated theatre today is used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, on the word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For the trip, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now $1 is approximately 3.8 shekels).
Buses are mainly by public transport, but there is a speed tram in Jerusalem, and in the city of Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper one.
It is basically an underground cableway.
Travelling with all kinds of urban public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can carry 1.5 hours with transfer.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, the work ceases in marketplaces, shops and public transport.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you get only kosher meals: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without scaly and dishes, which contain combinations of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish mash hummus, various types of sauces, balls of minced chickpeas - falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of fattened cats that are gracefully wandering to their taste.
In the evening you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Overear cats love populated places and will gladly embark on every goodness.
According to the car brand, the car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost around 15 shekels per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed by numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Getting to know the country and rest came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa waiver 9. February 2011.
'Great and mighty' will announce it to Moscow: emigrants save money on their language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, there have already been fraudsters in the country who sell "counterfeited" certificates
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, a law came into force, according to which every working migrant will be required to pass the examination of the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales sectors.
However, FMS promises that over time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the tests will consist not only of language proficiency, but also of Russian history and the basics of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
This law is not subject to people who have successfully achieved attestation and obtain an academic diploma in the break-up of the USSR in 1991.
Use, Convicted and Protection of Rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of Pushkin's Institute of the Russian Language, University of Friendship Between Nations, Moscow State University, State University in St. St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass trials in all cities; already today, more than 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have been able to ask the press many times the question: and what will it really bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service correspond to this - this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slave labor."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, Viktor Sebelev, chairman of the board of directors of FMS in Tajikistan, explains Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before they are committed.
Only the organized recruitment system will allow 90% of the problems of foreign workers to be solved.
Problems arise in emigrants without a profession, without education who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says with the conviction of Sebelev - the future migrant is doomed to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of help, provide him with a "vouchor" to glorious, tight hostels, in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, will suffer for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but after arrival they cheat them, confiscate their passports, they do not pay the promised wages," confirms the head of the Main Tajik Labor Migration Administration of the World Championship Tolib Sharipov.
Don't swear!
The less so much that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to Russia for work, recognize that they do not only not know the language of the country they want to get into, but they do not even have experience with the work.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather a misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiki can afford to obtain at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need to feed children something, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed decently, put on and equipped to school.
As children grow to a working age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, in view of the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out on those migrants who have a legal position.
If they don't have it, they won't count or take any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live as before in Russia illegally.
"Vellow, or Unauthorized Entry prohibited"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those linguistic difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we basically have fake documents, without registration, and from this there are cases of extortion.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," said citizen Tajikistan, Umed Khushadav, a citizen of Tajikistan, with a journalist.
"Well, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that false is not only the evidence of migrants on registration.
FMS staff have already seized several false certificates of passing the language exam.
Counterfeat documents are printed on an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, in the hope of making it easier to undergo tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times the amount higher than passing the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to secure the system from corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy documents, this is agreed by government officials and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, government authorities can promise foreign workers who have not mastered the tests for the first time to take a course of the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active dealing with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not put into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
The Ministry of Russia is presenting a draft tightening of the law in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of the government authorities to recent events: the complaint was the cases of the shooting at weddings that went without casualties, and a massacre prepared by Moscow's attorney Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in seven people perished.
The police want to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the committee of the Duma for Security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who promised that changes to the law on weapons will be presented to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem on the way of "tightening the screws".
An open letter has appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "nonsense tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminologist in an interview with the BBC's Russian newsroom.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed in the six months of 2012. The use of firearms by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior was committed, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced, the tightening of civil weapons legislation will not allow the perpetrators to switch to the "black" market.
According to them, it is currently possible to find any weapon in Moscow at a low price.
At present, the Interior Ministry says the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years at the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that accept weapons orders
The first of them - an "army or military way", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baraněc says.
Another type of "black guns" is weapons stolen by criminals among the officials of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement authorities.
Illegal "mainly" are being sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It is proven that some fires were established intentionally - to cover up the manka," says the former soldier.
In the words of Baranka, the manufacturers of weapons also bring their contributions.
"Currently, private arms companies are being created that are not competitive in the international market, and they are discarding weapons that supply the black market, including Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in small production, and a mafia was created that organized their smooth production," explains the former soldier.
Where'd the gun come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for the Analysis of Problems and Design of Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed the statements of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, they come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all the weapons found themselves on the black market "due to official officials whose work is linked to weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there was theft of weapons in their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavation by black "archaeologists" no longer buy - they are just too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go directly to military warehouses for new shipments.
Through an Ensign, the interested party buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order a gun with him and he'll sell it over the fence.
"He takes her to the city and sells it for 900 euros a piece of two magazines," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, so whenever a plan in the clarification of crimes begins to burn, they will carry out a control purchase with merchants of illegal weapons," the adviser adds.
"As in a luxury store"
Sellers most often find each other with each other through their acquaintance.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy appeared who offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Testing" platform, where there will be a man who would lead me to the "corner" where we will deal with each other.
The price was mainly I only found out there
Military correspondent Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, tells the clerks - an adviser.- I have such an acquaintance, but I do not fully trust him.
The sellers are on the market, but there it is also necessary to go there, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to settle that the daughter's tooth fell out."
And now I'm going to get there through the man I'm sure of.
He will only supply them to me, because he knows that I will not give him.
Beginners seek weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-90's, when he was processing a paper for publication on this topic.
Schemes did not change, according to him.
They gave him an album with photos where there was "everything you thought."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalled.
The buyer, according to the words Baraněc, does not offer a hare in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller into the forest and we build a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and if I convince myself that the gun shoots well, we start to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Tray on the sofa
Search engines will bring you to the website and groups on the "Vkontakt" website, where it is offered to buy a weapon "for various purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a set amount of money," they write in an advertising headline on the website "Buy a combat gun or a vending machine."
On this site, users leave their announcements and ask questions.
And the sale to minors?
"Of course, without a license," the user asks "Ivan" (speaking is preserved).
"I buy TT.Moscope" - briefly formulates the requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently blew up a huge network of frontline websites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can rattle with a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish on baits and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military Rapporteur and Higher Military Dial Officer Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered beyond the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes a payment through the ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photo and a description with instructions where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO's "Leisure to the Gun."
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can stay without a gun and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When buying an illegal firearm, you will pay an estimated amount from $100 to $900, according to experts.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Right for a gun" you will get a Makarov pistol for $100 to $300.
You have to wait a month or a month.
The weapon is dispatched from warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle cell.
According to the official statistics office, compared to the period January - October 2011, the number of these crimes in Russia fell by a total of 7%, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers pass through work at the cash desk of "McDonald"
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and popular fast food chains has picked up in America, such as "McDonald," "Burger King," Taco Bell, "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will be transformed into a ninth wave, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
The entire share is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the increase in modest salaries received by regular workers in Walmart and fast food systems, the aim of the protest organizers is to achieve in them the creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is practically unaffected by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday", when the orgy of cheap sell-offs hit America, engulfed millions of inhabitants and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart workers, where 2.2 million people work worldwide, have left their workplaces and demonstrated together with unions and left-wing activists of multinational retail chains whose goods are intended for people from the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many employees with low wages in Walmart stores only buy at work.
The availability and assortment of goods have made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because little pays its employees.
They also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trucks or handheld scanners.
Demonstrators on the "Black Friday" demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company increased sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker receives $9.5 an hour, but that doesn't match the cost level, employees say.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, the company will cost $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the wage increase fully to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than they are today.
Walmart's defense attorneys point out that the protest was held in only nine countries and should not cause virtually any harm to society.
The company's "Black Friday" in stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5000 items of goods per second.
In total, her treasury carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
In an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post website, a representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said that the jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all the "further media sensation" organized by the unions.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their destination was not Walmart department stores (they are not very popular in the aforementioned progressive city, and therefore they are hardly here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says it sells billions of portions, and then it doesn't even pay you sick leave and don't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and the regulations of New York state is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only slightly, and on average their rank-and-file workers in New York City receive $8.90 per hour.
No one has a lower wage in this expensive city.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work part-time after school and live with their parents go through the "McDonald" job at the "McDonald" job.
Few people see their main source of liveliness in this or plan to stay there for long.
At present, I am constantly meeting in an interview with the "McDonald" workers who complain that they have to live off this money and sometimes even feed their children from them.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks at fast food establishments start receiving at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. laws prohibit the administration from defending the establishment of trade unions and punishing trade union activists by bullying and layoffs.
On the other hand, governance rarely makes their lives easier.
However, it is difficult to introduce trade unions in fast food businesses even for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extraordinarily high turnover of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, noisy protests were also held in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the event was at noon a rally at the "McDonald" near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, especially city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick leave and pay you properly for your honest work!"
The protesters also received support for other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayoral candidate Billo de Blasio, who said that "we must come together to support fast food workers so that they will achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food.
But only a few hundred people attended it, although far from all of them were fast food workers, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain is misleading average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is the popular theme of augmented reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At its annual conference in early summer, Google demonstrated the working model of the new product, and in November it was announced that Microsoft also applied for the patent.
An interview with the head of an interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge laboratory, Sharamo Izadi, shows that for the company’s scientists, glasses are a thing of the past.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us what your research group is doing?
- We deal with human-to-mart interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far been stranded at the pixel phase on the flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with its finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone there is a very interesting option to control with gestures.
- What's next for us in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has transferred the interaction to the physical level, very many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the output flow is not particularly so far.
We try to change this, we are working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to get to know not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it?
- Surely it cannot be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our surroundings about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about swagger, just such scoops, short.
Gestures would not be taken by the camera of the device, but with a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
It is still large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, for example, a gesture + voice.
- And how?
- How do you ask me, for example, to give you this can of lemonade?
You will say it and at the same time show it.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's going to be very difficult to recognize.
So you want to get users to adapt to what a machine can or cannot at the moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's a rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human responses.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a fairly good deep resolution, this is very important.
- If you are talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Is there not enough resolution, depth or anything else today?
Basically, the current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a rate of 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's like nuts and depth.
At the current point of view, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds to the work of designers of algorithms.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y-axis, but also Z.
So also very important is the speed, the number of shots per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are frankly a little short, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes of our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much this affects a person's interaction with the machine.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just don't need as many touches, but I need some extra shots per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- Three "cameras" are now used in the Kinect system, one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter, and the other - a receiver of a deflected signal.
And already the third camera - this is actually a common sensor of visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or aggravate it because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations performed.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Don’t you think that when it comes to the daily use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding a smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "portable" form of reality expansion, when it would be possible to switch at any time from the glasses to the smartphone, the projection screen and further around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in this is their strength (private things you see only) and at the same time weakness - augmented reality on the basis of glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
Imagine for a moment that handling virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man" but also to an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers do your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tasmeral sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the other hand as a certain kind of substrate for imaging.
It records compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding the palpability of these "images in the air" - for example, interference with several directional ultrasound beams at the defined point where the finger is located evokes a tasting sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on your fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
Here there is another challenge that will be fought for for a long time - how to get a person who physically finds himself in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking through an open, practically infinite space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country trails (not at all, as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain delusion becomes a goal, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers - many things are in their very beginnings.
Tasteful instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrograd avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are at the head, are an avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already important figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe without reaching all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, the one at the Summer Garden, here in fashionable pubs and on the openings.
The paintings of Cyril Miller, wherever they are on display, are always attracted to crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophicalist St. Petersburg narrators, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a conspicuous man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80's and early 90's.
In addition to being a city person, his appearance on the streets brings a smile on the face of citizens, he raises everyone's mood.
He recently took a bottle of binge and became a petrophile-grower, because he matured into this complex role with all his bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk around the city all over the red and not in yellow or in turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although in general, everything that is just a little different from gray arouses aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at making an interview.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to discuss.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I understood what my path was.
At that time, the wave of old unofficial artists passed, and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I befriended the artists of the new wave, the post-gazones, who brought us to the "Pushinska 10", and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to theatre, dress, music, all genres except the word.
And all this was merged in your art-clinic ...- For me it was important to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best powers of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995 I took a place on Pushkina 10, and even before the reconstruction there was a music-artistry club, a bohemian club, a home of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
There was a lot born:NEM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how Šnura brought with the project "Each Van Gogh".
Both Šnur and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, dressed in tight leotards, in the middle of them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in vogue.
When the band started playing live, it became a "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many programs of hali-Galiv times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, which started his great career, basic education and professional training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the reverberation Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and regular guests left.
I'm the hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, a survey was held in the press, the special prize was "People in our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was appointed, ending my peak.
In new times according to the old rules, the work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the current years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which the topicality and piercing are vividly captured.
I will have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, today to be such is painful and terrible.
But in the clowns everything is blustered, the tragedy is taken.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian disguise in the ordering order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, oriented towards external mechanics, not the inner person.
Or maybe he can't shake hands and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing clothes.
- We recently saw you as a city bottle-holder.- A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should he be if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, utility art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
Previously, people gathered in clusters, bohemians loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken into a micro-company, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today you need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And there are a thousand spectators coming to Stasa Mikhailov!
- Fans come to him, there is a sexually social sphere involved.
And 300 people come to cultural land, and 10 thousand will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything withers.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one fools them and does not break what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted such pictures that hung on the wall with Falko and Larionov at one of the collectors.
I started with the paintings that people usually end with.
Today, people often confuse each other.
They say: Culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that is from elsewhere.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money for drawing paintings.
And I'm in favor of such a culture.
- Cyril, what's in need in St. Petersburg?
- Good experts on culture.
There is such a concept: an official through culture.
Not everyone can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper tsars, this was not the case in everything, the Tsars may not have understood the culture too much, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
In St. Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they are tucked somewhere in the corner, because there are a need for big experts who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today, tasteful language is thriving.
The same e-art, but they differ in that they sincerely say that we accept not all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think is St. Petersburg?
- Petersburg - this is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And on our escald, art thrives miserably.
We need cultural land, but here there are more writers than readers today, that is wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are inquisitive, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashionable thing, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented for the funds of the grant of St.Peterburk
Giving Birth in Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of space arquits with Earthlings on board embark on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep their genus in conditions of weightlessness or on a given substitute planet?
I don't think the choice is very big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute p. K. Sternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better living conditions on Mars, temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius on the surface of Venus.
It is possible to live there only at great altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Scientists have begun to address the issues of reproduction in space with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insects were carried out in orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to verify how the embryo develops in weightlessness.
At the ascent we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem arises with the fact that this bird must find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP).
If they don't find support, the birds are messing around and doing somercists.
After 10 hours, there was a complete disappearance of instincts in the freshly hatched birds.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was that within four days they simply died.
"We let the birds hatch twice, but then we refused because it's just impossible to work with them there," comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with the chickens in space.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
In the biosatelt "Bion", however, there will be only beings of one gender.
There was an experiment with rats who were already pregnant to broadcast into space.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural there.
"It was only up to biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, cosmic rats were born a thunderbolt.
However, it has not yet been reached to the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a tough task.
Animals, in the absence of the usual environment, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens is governed by abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Těreškov.
The most precious thing mankind has is the female body.
Our Tchaika flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether it would last a flight into space.
Whether he can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"No one has answered this question yet," says veteran of the vascan-space industry Vachtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after flying into space, the first female cosmonaute Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonaute Svetlana Savicka was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who have been born and healthy offspring have been born after many years.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights," says Cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Russia's Herogue, Valery Polyakov.
Nevertheless, humanity must inevitably look for new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the formation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions with zero attraction, astronauts adopt the habits needed to work in the open universe.
Water mimics the state of weightlessness.
Although for adults water is even a comfortable, but in a way a strange environment, for young children it is a natural element.
The little ichtiander seems to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the baby is located on average 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid and that it is then easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, only 2 weeks pass.
"That's very little for the baby to forget something," says baby at the newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short - if a state of weightlessness for a newborn baby is a more natural state, then for women is more natural inevitable gravity, an attractive force.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, the body's ability to expel the fetus decreases very quickly.
This can be left aside if the stimulators of muscle activity in childbirth work.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber, in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"What's next?" Valery Poljakokov asks complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the Earth's attraction does not affect the body, it cannot properly form the skeleton or the system of muscles.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he unconditionally needs for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unadapted to the local environment," said RAN Igor Pestov, head of IBM Pioetic Commission.
So the kind of childbihage in the universe is just a theoretical question today.
But one day there will come a time when it becomes a reality, and when the Earthlings will go in their aerial to a far planet that becomes the home of their descendants born in the universe.
Head of the SAO: Control of the Švarc system failed due to politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation in connection with public procurement, but it is lagging behind in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, says this.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - this is what I think is missing in our opinion," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also indicated by the joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of improper practice, he cites the approach of Petr Nečas to the so-called "svarcsystem".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneur with his controls - is he banned or allowed?
"The law must be set up somehow, and if it disables something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which is obliged to go to control and enforce duties," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German side, within which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, the European legislation regulates how to deal with public procurement, followed by individual national legislation and then practice itself.
We put all this together, and even though the control is not yet finished, we showed very interesting differences - generally speaking, the legislation is perhaps "stricer and more perfect" in our country, however, the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to deal with the application of the law itself.
What can this project help you, what does it mean for you?
It is such a joint control that could contribute to the need to stop efforts to refine laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price in order to exclude enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But by lowering the limit of orders, we don’t necessarily have to achieve that.
Perhaps the system will overwhelm itself with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw much easier from it than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transfer of legislation related to public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our SAO, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, as the SAO operates there Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similarly to us, also has a college, only it is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle the two authorities proceed similarly.
The powers are also similar to some extent, but by the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so it has these auditories even at the level of individual Länder - in this the system is a little different from ours.
The BRH can only control federal money, represented by state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by regions and municipalities, are checked there from the level of the Federal Courts of Auditors.
As far as the legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, however, in some respects, Germany is described as a model, but it can certainly not be said that it is better in everything.
Is it also because they have better controllers?
I'm sure I'm not, but again I say, I don't like that comparisons.
But it must be said that even the countries we consider a role model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, it would be no beneficial for them to cooperate with our office, would it?
As for domestic legislation, what was the amendment to the Public Procurement Act meant for your office, are there any effects already manifested?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet reflected in our inspections in our inspections.
Because we do ex post checks, we need to count on some delay.
We are only observing this in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new tool "hazardation of risks of wastefulness", through which we have driven almost 14 thousand public contracts, and we analyzed them - there, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted and so on.
Do you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or an additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
A problem that may arise here that the rules will "tightens" and it will not be possible to follow them.
Even in the functioning of the previous rules, the audited persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth tightening the law in this way?
I don't think so in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only put more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And how to get out of it?
Let's show where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs by checking the so-called "svarcsystem" - and what does that mean?
Is the Shunca system banned or allowed?
The law must be set up in some way, and if it disables something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which is obliged to go to control and enforce duties.
He can say, "We're going to change that law and we're going to allow it," but he can't say we're going to act like nothing.
There are relatively strict rules in the Public Procurement Act, how to formally execute - which is correct to protect public tender.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best bid is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - this is what I think is missing in our opinion.
Roads are sometimes frozen, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
But the roads are usually passable, somewhere with caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region this morning, the roads were passable, but sometimes frozen and also snowy.
The temperature dropped between five to ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped and lies only a weak layer in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
In places there was also lower visibility due to the fog, according to data from the dispatching of regional road workers.
R6 expressways and first-class roads are now passable without restrictions in the region.
Caution, however, is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
All second- and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
On them, however, in some sections there are still remnants of frozen and sometimes mired snow.
Especially in higher elevations, driving should be given increased attention.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Regions
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frying, in higher elevations and in the mountains there may be a layer of snow on the roads, reports on its website the Road and Motorway Directorate.
Road workers warn drivers against frost, it can form especially in the higher elevations of the Pardubice Region.
Ice can be around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically, roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy are treated.
Snow is mainly on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest elevations on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia, it is most often clear to partly cloudy without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a light wind blows.
The Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen Region are passable this morning, but with caution and the ride needs to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, temperatures range from three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some roads may be icy.
In places, drivers must also count on the fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information of the dispatching of regional road workers.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, but increased caution is recommended by the road managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frosty surface.
In the southern Pilsen and Tachov regions, however, there may be frozen sections.
Second- and third-class roads are damp and also in this case there is a warning about the icy sections.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Today, the snow on the road must be counted on drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region.
After the chemical sprinkles, she remained on the Červenohorské saddle and on the way to the Videlský Cross.
Snowmen were driven into the field by snow at night, according to the road managers, about three centimeters were snowed in Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, roads are usually passable without restrictions.
"In the Šumperk region, there is a remnant of snow in the highest elevations.
Drivers have to count on snow porridge on Červenohorské sedlo in the direction of Jeseník," a dispatcher at the Šumperk Road Administration told the Czech News Agency today.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník region also went to the field at night, but the highest positions are now after chemical treatment bare and wet.
In the Olomouc region, the roads are passable without restrictions, but in the Šternberk region, drivers should be careful in forest sections, where the roads remained damp.
Ústí nad Labem Region, Liberec Region
Several difficult-to-miss places are reported today morning by road workers in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with fallen snow or glacier, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the Ústí region is closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are also held below zero in lower elevations, so ice and snow will probably last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Central Bohemian Uplands, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications are not yet reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by road workers, especially from around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions were ideal for her at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night bright and cold.
Of the main roads, unfavorable conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the border of the Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bent branches of trees, which, under the snow, bent to the road.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we humans like to catch on to us.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and we say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to readers in more detail?
It is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before 20 December at 21 o'CL o'CLight, 3 concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at a time when the Mayan calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to accumulate enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think, together with the public, about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World Cancelled".
It is already very popular on YouTube, will there be a feature at these benefit concerts?
Of course, in complete conclusion, that is, if we do everything succeed and the end of the world does not occur...
It will be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
The anthems suddenly also connect in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
Words about this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, sings in it also Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, due to the fact that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and entertained by our cooperation with us.
What will the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world go for?
The equipment of the Studeo barrier-free educational centre, which we have been implementing with the Tapolistic Association in Jedlička Institute for six years.
Under students of the schools of Jedlička’s institute, the lecturers regularly attend and devote themselves to them in activities that they enjoy and interest.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to allow them this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We tried to put together a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic events" in the future?
In May we will perform at the Prague Spring for the first time, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and personally, while we are in the USA, I would like to connect it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have already performed, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group made up of disabled people.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair, its trucks have to travel in the luggage compartment, then, of course, we carry a large amount of cargo and crates with tools...
However, so far it has always been done without problems, both CSA and British Airways have been well prepared for us that I was surprised many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how they differ in wheelchair access, public access to handicapped people and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our country, we have just seen in Russia that everything is still in the very beginning in the east.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-free, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric wheelchair to move alone in the city center.
It does not pay for such a self-evident as that you prefer wheelchair users in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civic associations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things that we're still in...
However, it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved in this.
In both London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with heavy disabilities to move independently in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, in which we are a little ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or wheelchair accessible is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things start to change for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years ago, what made you start it in 1998?
I joined the Jedlička Institute as an educator, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play, among other things, on the saxophone, so I and my colleague established an interest music club.
Well, over time, as our presenter Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But has the popularity come in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with well-known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We realized that a job that is not seen, in fact, it was as if it did not exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it with The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something differently.
Showbusiness is overflowing with things where one imitates the other.
It is in a way logical, everything new is received carefully and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that is natural...
But the regret is utterly useless, because people with disabilities are no suffering from all abandoned beings we have to regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary resources to do so.
I say that if something happens to people with disabilities, it's not just a shift for them, it's for the whole society.
Did this success also help that you are a strict boss, as many people have marked you?
When we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and demand a certain discipline.
I think that’s perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their heads in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to rehearse twice a week, go to the preparation and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were at the beginnings of it in 1998?
Only one Láďa Angelovich.
We are an open group, people are leaving and coming, that cannot be prevented.
Whoever has the will and taste always has an open door with us
The day before the expected end of the world will take place, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynomy with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will connect with telebridge at the end of the evening while singing the song of The Tap Tap "The End of the World Canceled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years old have free tickets in the presale of Bohemiaticket
Poland and Cosmos.
Last week, Poland was adopted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the next years participated in a number of projects of the agency.
Poland’s journey to the cosmos has started much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were engaged in the cosmos before the Second World War; but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I will commemorate the lecture A. Šternfeld in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, who on December 6, 1933, presented ideas from his pioneering work Entering the Cosmonautics.
Thoughts of a young engineer (b. 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld recalled that only dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Peltere and André Louis Hirsch Award for joining the Cosmonautics in France.
The mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish journals, he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of astronautics, and his contribution was also appreciated that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925, a rail drainage was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used to start the dressage or to brake it.
Information about this dressage is known only from the period press.
From 1933, Polish artillery has begun to deal with missiles.
The research was provided by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with prof. Mieczyslaw Wolf and Prof. Gustaem Mokrzyckeigi.
It is clear from the preserved materials that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, the arrival of the German troops was interrupted by the research.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter missile was created in the professional press, designed by engineer Rohoziński and the following year the work of Rakieta - the torpedo powietrzna and rakitobombom lotnicza by Leliwy-Krzywoblock.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) dedicated to all the projects of military use of missile technology, which he coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ceased to start the war.
After the war in the Polish press, other works dedicated to the cosmonautics appear in Polish Astronautyczne (Polkkie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is mentioned in the company in the November issue of the 1954 edition of the 1954 magazine, in which there are four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from prof. M. Subotowicze, is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, the projects of artificial satellites were already underway, and it was clear that space research was a perspective field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to enter the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and already in the autumn PTA became a full member.
And the following year, the first PTA chairman Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became the vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has significantly contributed to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred on 10. October 1958.
The rocket with an interval of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were launched in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another developmental type should have been capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have an output of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
In 1962, however, further developments were suspended.
The meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 liters were available.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the development of the Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests began in October 1970, taking place at the Aviation Institute.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in the exploration of space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaute after Vladimir Remko.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalised world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that the individual economic departments, the national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the considerable differences in the price of labor, (mens) there is a price tension.
Under this term, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer strives to impose cheap goods in competition by "staying" the price of a competitor in order to bring a greater market share to itself and thus increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to translate production abroad, or to buy there cheaply, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus responsibility for its produced unemployment, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The whole situation is amplified by the complete unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social social damage he has done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create a situation in individual economies where national governments are forced to enter into mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital their own populations, regardless of the social slumping.
This is mainly reflected in the changes in applicable laws.
The aim is to economically force the population to adopt the price dictate of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done both by a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is rising poverty, along with an increase in the gap between the poor and the rich.
Public food dispensaries for the poor have been in the Federal Republic of Germany for many years who cannot make a living from their own work.
The number of these people is already going up to the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, there are quite commonly cases that properly employed people receive such wages that the state must pay them to an existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees of the Bundestag.
The economical measures of virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people, under the pressure of a catastrophic social level, are forced to either emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live on the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital will come to the country one day.
But here it is necessary to ask where it will come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turk, the Moroccan, or the Egyptian, or the African are still working for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media misbehaves that the state cannot capitalize on its own economy, that a managed economy is leading to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital stubbornly insists on the opinion that the State must not interfere with the economy by directing interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not affect, now it actually governs politics and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is the clear answer that yes.
The proof is the existence of practically the omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is criminal, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministries for lack of funds are commissioning the draft laws to private law firms that are usually in contact with industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power thus comes not in this way from the people, as Western-type constitutions preach, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now quickly in a situation, as described by Appianos in his work of the Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia: "The state has long been in complete disarray and the authorities were occupied by violence.
For bribery, illegal acquisition of favor and with the help of stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption flourished without any inhibitions, and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold vote" ..."characteric people did not apply for the office at all, so that once, as a result of this disruption, the state was without consuls for eight months." “It has indeed begun to be said that the only remedy in the evil situation is self-government, and that it is necessary to choose an energetic man.” Appiano thought of Pompeio, but he became Caesar, who turned democracy into self-government.
Conclusion As in Antiquity, the current society is based on the reckless preference of its own benefit, regardless of the social interest.
Private capital is no longer inherently able to understand and exercise society-wide benefit.
The result is now, like then, an unprecedented decadence of the elites without any effort to reform a deeper character.
The causality of the rise of both fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20 century.
In the present state, the demise of these systems in favor of liberal-type democracy can be considered a certain recess with the expectation of another round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring in the future of possible hundreds of thousands of casualties, humanitarian and social catastrophes, which we are already witnessing together with crimes against humanity as we know them from old and new history.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from competition at both international and internal European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms that will strengthen the capital participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"Nothing comes from violence and never can" Sting in the song Fragile, whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want wars, there wouldn't be any" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reactions emerged.
One is behind Israel, they argue its right to self-defense, and the Palestinians fall into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, genocide against Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodically recurring waves of killing and who is the victim, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I want to offer readers a view of the curtain, the view of who, above all, the 95-year-long tension (counting from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East.
Some of my reflections are supported by available historical facts some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether they were always these personalities who have completely autonomously guided their actions, or whether someone who directed their actions to a pre-determined goal was behind their throne.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have come to the life of a generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands out one that could be considered the head of the octopus (if anyone is still standing over them I don't know, but I don't rule it out) - the Rothschiels.
There's not much written about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought as early as the 90's of the 19th century to stop linking their name to the highly criminal acts in which they stood and which for them always meant the consolidation of power, the proliferation of wealth, or both.
They have major shares in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank are not waging or preparing wars (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there are only four, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to rebel this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the central bank status of the Rothschield Bank of America, began to issue his own (understand government) money during the Civil War, and was murdered in the theater in 1865.
JFK began to spend its own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led from 1859 to the formulation of the plan of three world wars by the highest-end, 33rd stage of initiation by Albert Pik.
The first war was tasked with removing large monarchist state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial estate of Great Britain, and the third is to reduce the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury are enough and do not consume as many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a foreground for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of richest families, led by Rothschieldy, works is inducing a crisis and then offering a solution (order of chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, so as not to repeat the crisis as the one it provoked in 1907).
So after they managed to unleash the First World War of the Tsarland R-U throne Ferdinand by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the First World War, they destroyed the tsarist Russia by the launch of the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, militarily and economically unfounded, surrender of Germany (no longer the need for war for the destruction of tsarist Russia) and subsequently the Central European power, Austria Hungary, was fragmented.
For the easier start of the Second World War, the bankers of politics had a latently conflicting situation created by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, creating the assumption of radicalization of the impoverished masses and then it was enough to just slip them a strong enough, culprits marking and simple solutions offering the Fever and then creating a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play the fifth time,
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschiilda stimulated the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created a precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began to take place.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
World War II broke out whether Hitler broke out of the chain on which he was initially held by international bankers, or everything he did was plan to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created a precondition for accepting the Jewish state by world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like Germany’s 2nd war, the proclamation of Israel was created by the proclamation of the Third War.
If international bankers succeed in starting it, the Jewish people, like the latter, will be a victim on the front line of fighting, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let us only take how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice begets injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything stood the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers are only suing people to choose their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel's hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, towards international bankers loyal, a politician who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to grow into a global conflict and, given Iran's control over the Strait of the Strait of the world, which is only a broad one (the world's).
In what light the words David Rockefeller said now appear in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree to the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes it a totally controlled being.
And it forces all the small and the great, rich and poor, free and of the slaves, to have on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that he cannot buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of the beast or the number of its name.
This must be understood: let him summage the numbers of the beast.
That number denotes a person, and it's sixty-six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When It's The Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, who were the patron saint of his regime for several decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - she could not afford to throw the shah overboard, because it would so fundamentally jeopardize trust in allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostage by force.
Inmates were eventually released after 444 days, after the negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their lot at home sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was filled, six employees escaped from it.
After the complex peripeties, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of a film crew that surveyed the locations for filming a sci-fi movie in the country.
Combination of genres
The plan, invented by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to make the legend believable, the film project was written in specialized magazines, there were press conferences, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, a betrayal - an example of Danny's team series.
The film alternates with moods - on the one hand, documentary sequences from Tehran (in the subtitle sequence are shown iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightweight passages from Hollywood, dealt with irony and mild exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a mocked actor he became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also the first Affleck film that doesn’t take place in the director’s home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the director's older films escalated above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows him in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, while reconstructing real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and unconvincibility, which occurs when history moves somewhere out of the blue.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in scenes of the fictional (a fake crew at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer much in the cinematic sense of thrilling scenes.
He almost works with it quite successfully, sometimes he thinks of something about reality - everything does not work out so elegantly there (a scene in which the impending crisis at the Tehran airport turns the phone call in America and the chase after the runway quite far-fetched).
But the weakness of Argo is the distraction resulting from the need to show too many plots in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and are far from the only film.
Affleck's film kind of loses a dramatic turn, it's a picture that can be watched with a slight interest, to appreciate the realization and retro style evoking thrillers of the 70's.
But it's hard to tear down.
As a reminder of one still certain way of living history and proof of how exaggerated the notions of all-powerful and omniscient secret services are, but it is sufficient.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces the survey on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU".
"The last event led us to do so, when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the leadership of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the poll, told Právo.
Among the nominees nominated, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court on the unification of premium rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured in the prices of life insurance, because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU can be nominated by people by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The controversial EU regulation also includes the mandatory mixing of biofuels into fuel, which is due to nature, as a result of the use of reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or the directive on the size of the hen cages, due to which eggs have significantly increased this year.
Criticism has previously also faced a factual ban on the use of the term spread butter or the elimination of ink lamps from sale.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from one or another trade or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic now even threatens the veto promotes the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and were not allowed to show "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission has resisted by merely harmonising the existing inconsistent national standards that have complicated trading.
Despite the resistance of some countries, the EU has already softened the standards on fruit and vegetables, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for the poll may also be last year's EU regulation, according to which the sold inflatable balloons must be mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 must not inflate them unattended adult supervision.
The EU has called off on U.S. research, according to which balloons among the toys are the leading cause of the death of children to suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 when blowing into fairground farts.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule on the European officials themselves is also quite absurd - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) in place.
Bankovápáplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, has nominated the EU regulation on the volume of food inventories in the territory of a Member State in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities.
The EU has set maximum volumes of food stocks that could be located in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a hefty fine.
The organizers of the poll were also intrigued by the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies on the application for a grant.
However, these ideas were not created in Brussels, but in Prague.
“We are handicapped by the fact that we do not have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said then-Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was born in our country and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state was supposed to be full of warehouses that he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the Czech Republic continuing to ports.
In the end, the European Commission went out to meet the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for obtaining the subsidy was offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development managed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically to write an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While the regulations are easily criticized in the Member States, EU efforts to regulate, while more effective functioning and the development of the whole Union, according to a number of experts, they deserve recognition.
According to experts, the more serious problem, is, for example, drawing EU subsidies for projects that have no indication of anything inconsistent with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced by the Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
The emotions among Czechs are also aroused by the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic in Brussels must fight for the right to specific designation of its traditional products, while not always succeeding in this match.
Although the Czechs defended the designation of Olomouc cheesecakes after a six-year battle with the Germans and Austrians, but the domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed our producers.
The name rum can only be carried by products from cane spirit, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, the company of world-famous cheeses feta and gorgonzola, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany and Parma hams have already found, for example, Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pohořelice and Třeboň carp and Žatek hops.
The EU trademark can also boast Pardubice gingerbread and Hořice tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does it occur to you that he wants to run for president?
I'm not interested in being a senator or a president.
If it works in our country without any problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country steal from the last twenty years, as thieves run here, people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I was already forty and I am an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but you soon went to the Castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who elected you?
All the time I said I would go to the fight for the Castle according to the result in the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool to make my visions.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The trouble is not only that, as a nation, we swear in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
To this will be joined by the media, which dishonors a person and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I was told to brib journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You set out to fight for the Castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive property returns above twenty million.
You have to change the law.
As president, however, you do not have such powers, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How are you going to figure this out?
When, as a citizen, I was lobbying for the guidance to be a free trade, it was possible to enforce it.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or from the right, they deliberately reject it, and this delays citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much more potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without partisan boxing and dogmas I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing or left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me rather left.
It doesn’t matter to me at all whether a little left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we go forward.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or ODS, and I will also oppose the bad idea.
You're gonna say you're a populist.
But you're not proving what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about already work in the world, or important experts have spoken about.
But without the support of parliament, you'll just have passwords.
And with that, you won’t be able to do with politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will succeed in asserting, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to enforce it.
If I were elected president, it is not a problem to hold a television live broadcast, where I will ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to enact substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want it.
If there is a strong personality who will name the abuses, one can push for the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, that was due to public pressure.
I'm just honestly, I'm an amateur, that I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I try to find allies.
I have only just started in politics and I will try to gain majority support for my program.
I try to move things myself if I can’t, I’ll be done in six years and I’ll go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a saver.
I know that I will not do anything in one person, so I went around a number of well-known people to see if they would also run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Jančura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered fraud with light heating oils.
I've been running that people are really dissatisfied, but now I'm in a bind.
Sixty percent of people did not go to the polls, and those who went mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People have elected the Senate to make the changes difficult to push.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as for the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering starting your own party?
I haven't considered that yet, because I don't have time to check every potential sidewalk's clean past, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20 grand in my transparent account.
Don't you have the money?
You're talking about property returns, what's yours?
Private property is estimated at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Škoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against bad things and abuses.
Do you drive Aston Martin, have $60 million property and you don’t have the money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to give your own money too much.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors is that my program is probably not so interested.
And I have no obligation to campaign from my own.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover me what I will receive a senatorial salary.
But I wouldn't have made a living out of it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs 30 grand a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I'm not running.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to dampen these activities?
But that has nothing to do with the salary.
As I promised, I partially dampened my activities.
For example, my representative will become the managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who would save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much did you be used to taking monthly as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take on.
And if I was president, I would end my business.

MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures don't just take place in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
"I find the building happy, it looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who is passing by the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Of all, the house is nice."
I wonder why we still need a library today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
No one voluntarily visits to any of these old-style libraries today, do they?
Spijkenisses, a housing estate in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own job opportunities, which is not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80 000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision was made to contribute to universal education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges that are depicted on euro banknotes.
However, the success of the educational offensive was not dizzying.
And so the city councillors recognized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam's MVRDV architectural studio, a master of insanely bold column charts and a contractor of witty, often even cynical buildings, accepted the thing with the usual calmness, and at a competitive meeting in 2003 he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission was still looking around and shrugging his shoulders, the cheeky Maas piled up his presents on himself by his size, and ended his activist-reasoning speech with the words "Dear City Community!"
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was planted for 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second place of the "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
Small-town gray, which has not yet been able to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an extraordinarily ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
First impression: reading eldorado under the hatch for cheese.
Although the middle of the massif of the mountain is a lift, but you will discover real spatial and reading passions only during the walking time of the topography.
From all sides, the glazed interior is bright and clear, the floor made of burnt cabbage and elegant street lantern clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog and boys and girls who play football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the shelves with books along the facade stand, and in the middle there is a large dark space that is mostly uncozy and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and we extended the space for the reader from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountains of Books is cleverly used: in the center there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a control room for housekeeping.
A special pleasure are black shelves for books, which are once the lining of the walls, one sill and another time the railing of stairs.
Appearance, structure and odor are foreign.
Even sworn architects and building engineers are twisting their heads over the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
And so, in a fries farm, we once encountered a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, it has been used as a base under the roots of a millimeter flee from synthetic matter in greenhouses and in the fields in the Netherlands.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons and then is ripe for throwing in bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such a quantity - was pressed on boards with a thickness of four centimeters.
By acting hot and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and loadable material that smells a little like a new car and a bit like sporty shoes.
105 steps can be reached the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long journey, you will be rewarded in a literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also by Dutch croquettes and ficuses in pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, but mainly about the correct humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for the New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but despite many glass surfaces, this house is a demonstration project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
He heats up and cools through the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass hat-court, the sun shines in only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden trusses, which stand perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as shading and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest can handle fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic in the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there before.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to Boekenberg as the "long-expected soul" of Spilkenisse.
Reason: every city resident was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal fund.
Thus, optical gaps in the previously not fully equipped library, which currently consists of 70 000 pieces, should have been filled first.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are completely full.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says designer Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident has a certain relationship with the new house now.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This succeeded MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called the formation of identity in professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated, it may be.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting in the decision to adopt Palestine.
According to U.S.-Europe relations expert Stephen Szabo, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the proposal for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
Then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its particular relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it's going to support the U.S. position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO enforced it.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on major international issues?
Yes, that's right.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, in the direction of the policy, which was, so to speak, controlled by the US, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I mean, they're just getting settled in their role, but they're on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
To the foreign policy they have in France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It shows readiness to take on national interests as well as positions that are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, other than the economic interests of other superpowers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to deter the public, but also the elites in Arab countries.
This actually plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to attribute too much importance to it, that’s not a one-sided relationship.
In any case, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany’s relations with the US hurt when Germany abstained from voting in the case of both important decisions, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great understanding in Europe and even in the US for a German attitude.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a turning point as it was on Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even benefit from this a certain respect.
This signals that they must be considered an international player and their interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, has made a clear vote of the veto.
Are there differences of opinion among the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal politics.
I think the Obama administration is probably secretly of a considerable understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, of course, this attitude cannot, of course, stand up publicly.
I think the differences in opinions are not really as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all too excited about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
They cannot therefore be part of a wider line and instead have to drive things forward from their own position.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future and push Europe towards a European stance.
This, of course, is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does he want to take on the main role?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not accustomed to this, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a bigger role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes on a bigger role, anti-German sentiments arise.
This does not make it easier for the Germans.
It is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The US influence in European policy is now steadily declining, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum. Who else is left here?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and it makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America are jointly studying the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Professional of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this lies the designation, which is quite officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they use protections until they are sued by the real owners of the brand.
It is unclear whether rights will be reached.
"It's becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violating the protection rights in the Far East.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
Counter-germintors need a few extra letters to sign up their tags.
For example, Gucci will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prad, they will register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sporting goods Puma, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens a binder with the recordings of the stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had a Zegna DF Puma trademark there. An artificial name that also parasitizes on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
There are several-storey department stores in large cities where counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
Pattloch's cases are different. On behalf of its mandates, it is proceeding against Chinese companies from the trademark office who are officially entitled to use a label that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," an affiliate mark.
This is the word on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It hurts the trade, we have to fight it," Pattloch urges.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the court costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to data from CLSA, China, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest market of luxury goods and the market that is growing the fastest.
However, the deletion of dubious records in the register of brands can be difficult to achieve, and it costs something.
The proceedings can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the reproached name became a "market reality" after a long duration.
When the plaintiff has bad luck, they still have to pay the plagiarist because it has damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
Known cases also apply to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German pump manufacturer for the Concrete mixture Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion goods maker Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the well-known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO sign office admits that there were deficiencies there in 2010 due to too small numbers of employees and premises.
But last year, the "proceede of the workforce has returned to normal from an emergency situation."
For example, the number of unconstructed objection procedures fell by 22 percent.
57 000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81 500 complaints are still pending at the office.
Something against it is expensive
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million brand protection applications, nearly a third more than 2010.
This is a record and it means that China has been running a list of new applications worldwide for the tenth time in a row.
This also applies to the number of valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected in the fees.
In simple terms, each login costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
The dispute against this is several times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans have achieved the abolition of its illegal production of imitated automobile parts.
However, the forger has secured China's rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would omit it ourselves, because in Germany, surnames cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trade office also rejected the Munich-based company’s objection.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg has obtained the right, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight today.
You need to be careful
The matter is now being heard in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Deficial is extremely costly and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company's archives, they even had to inspect the hundred-year-old files to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered in vain a "high six-digal amount in euros" in opposition to settle the dispute.
"That's where you see what it means to us," Wentzler says.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will also affect Europe.
This is when the imitators secure unprotected brands.
In Germany, for example, one Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
The group gave up this area of business a long time ago, yet it was able to avert registration.
"You need to be careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German businesses to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Foreigners would rather have "everything worth protecting in any way, even in China," Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it may be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the last act of its drama with the brand, then it will probably have to pay the royalties for its own name to the opposing party, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in a disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Stunting, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, orphans are happy about it for parents who died of AIDS.
A story of a connection that surpasses far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's moccasins are looking for a tact on the dance floor and quickly finding it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - are slowly swollen, the voices of the singers - are being urged, and they are chasing each other.
The 29-year-old conductor, Fiete Hopf, almost lifts it off his textile boots as he connects voices with his supplely wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is trying out a new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years old, from human genetics researcher to a caretaker.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every chorus voice has a different text and, moreover, in a very foreign language - a zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Program, estimates that there are roughly 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245 000 orphans from parents who died of AIDS.
More than 40 percent of the population is already positive.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni, Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend a second-grade school.
A patronage can be taken over for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means "tory story story story" language in the language, or also "the one who glorifies".
With gassy bantušt'in, no one can talk in this space, just sing.
For almost a decade, he has been replaying the choir of the song in this foreign soft language and sometimes also brings them back to where they originally come from: to the south of Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, the village of Esitjeni, which is dependent on the power of the voices of the German corps, is in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland.
Forty percent is infected
There are about 2000 people, some still in plain clay or straw huts. Most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, because they have succumbed to HIV.
In Estijen, you can see in the small, the stance of all Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The circumcise of the male foreskin, which demonstrably reduces the risk of infection by half, does not accept the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus weakened immunity in themselves. There is no rarity that they die at less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by a choir on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, the members of the Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothes, education.
Without graduation, they have no chance in the poor country at all.
At first, it was still a private commitment of individuals who, for a few euros a year, allowed a child to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, the choir of the association "Voices for Africa" was founded, which has since taken care of orphans from parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrh (gonore).
Frequent viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Mutters and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found primarily in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four of the five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases are often, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (modon), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively few among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV are in this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more often than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomaviruses often occur among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of infections with syphilis more than doubled in 2001 to 3698 illnesses in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about one-tenth less than a year before.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unobserved.
How can I protect yourself?
The dangers of infection can reduce condoms, but they do not offer one hundred percent protection.
Because the originators of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations and last but not least to the fees that the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money is collected.
"In total, we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says the chairwoman of the association, Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can assert herself.
It also takes care that orphaned children find shelter, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the zulu language is called old women, are the support of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children arrive in time in the uniforms of school every day.
Children who no longer have no one go to the shelter to Khanyisila, a lonely woman who is paid for by the association as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" established a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged for many people to have had an HIV test in the village.
That's not self-evident. Even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because he has to do with sexuality."
In fact, pretty strange in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his subtly subsistence lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state-approved way of life is also to blame for the HIV virus to spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
To at least somewhat promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels once every two, three years together in South Africa, singing songs full of grief, belligerence, confidence in the future and the self-confidence of blacks, many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the speech of blacks - such an award brings not only the mood and joy, but also has already brought tears to many wild border soldiers.
The path always leads to Esitjen, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village can hardly be found on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esytjen, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is 8733 kilometers away, to the trampling singers in the Bergheimer Straße retirement, you can see that the light shines here as well.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although the sun is the closest, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published on Thursday by the professional magazine "Science".
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It is reportedly at least 30 centimeters and maybe even up to 20 meters thick.
This water seems to have come from comets or perhaps from the asteroids that crashed into Mercury.
But let us not put the discovery of ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said leading scientists working on the Messenger spacecraft, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us clarify how the water and other essential elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved by Earthlings, participate in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, pictures, small windows will be sent to Earth, small windows into endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic instrument developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, circling beyond Neptune, Ceres is not a “planet” under the new conceptual definition of the International Astronomical Union.
This cutout from the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, harder to identify are pink-colored "newborns" in the birth hall of stars.
This area where stars form - scientists unromanticly called it W5 - discovered the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This changeable heat of dying stars was captured by the Spitzer telescope NASA.
The muffin ring consists of a material that the star ejected during the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, which is 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
A photo of the galactic "cradle" was taken by the NASA Spitzer telescope.
The star cluster of Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters, is visible to the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors will stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may seem like a red eye to the observer in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light-years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to Earth continents earned this nebula the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the origin of an extraordinary coloration.
This "baby" among the stars was able to scan the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope in full glory.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps these are the remains of Saturn's moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: the vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloration, become real works of art.
The footage, published by the European Southern Observatory, depicts the trifid gland several thousand light-years away from the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (ditated into three parts, tri-clant), as the dark stripes of dust divide the glowing heart of this star maternity ward into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadononese, astronomers photographed a harbinger of cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the nucleus of two merging galaxies is rushing to each other and a collision must inevitably occur.
This birth of the star was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don’t like technical abbreviations, you can call it the nickname South Windmill.
A photo from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a cutout of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Cefea.
This 1400 light-years-old nebulae consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual household dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, which is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arpo 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this starwash, there is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The robe of the stars is still emerging of new additions.
Also, this star cloud, coupled with the Rosette Nebula, is giving birth to ever-new young stars. They are 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is not yet dust, but only gas.
Scientists believe it was formed only shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the universe.
Our Views of Space: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608. Before Galileo Galilei, he used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to widen - and the views they mediate are getting deeper and deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inside of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the inexpensive method of construction: the telescope is secured by a hooker at a height angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the altitude angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Portohic), scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - any computer owner who gives its computing power can help.
A view of the observatory of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There is a Very Large Telescope - and honoring its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can shine through the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is supposed to be full 42 meters and folded is to be made of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures can be expected in 2018 at the earliest.
Two Kecka binoculars on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Kecko telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into space using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be created - with a thirty-meter diameter of a mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
The most important impressions from space, however, are conveyed to us by the Hubble Space Telescope.
It has been providing us with remote worlds since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler space telescope has been searching for extra-solar planets since March 2009 - especially for those that are habitable.
2. In February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The picture documents the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be fired into space aboard the Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the telescope's tasks is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice is at the south pole of Mercury.
For this, however, there is no reliable data, as Messenger is circling this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for several decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger spacecraft, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now sure.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to the biblical age.
There is even a long-lived museum.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to the biblical age.
There is even a long-lived museum.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call the Talyš mountain range wildly romantic.
The minibus rattles along the road with many bends along densely forested hills, predatory rivers and simple peasant buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems to be in the Black Forest.
However, this is the southernmost south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group Talys, about which it is not very well known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and live to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts overly monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is somehow not suitable for the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
Eight hours are needed for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-lane.
The fairy-tale wealth for which the countries owe to the oil in the Caspian Sea have not yet arrived here in the countryside.
Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced, however, that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world next year," says Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the life of almost eight dozen Talys from the neighborhood, who are over the age of a hundred years old, is documented. Fatulayeva shows the black and white photo.
He's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still fathered a child.
However, the disputed star of this museum is the shepherd of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who was reportedly 168 years old.
However, the birth certificate does not exist.
And since the oldest person with the documents was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely dubious.
"It was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he said he also fathered a daughter.
Was Şirali Müslümov not wrong at the age of a few decades?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the age-old people in Central Asia.
"Conspicuously, many people of old age live even in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "Also in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be given, especially when registers are missing.
A glass of melted butter every day
But the fact is that people in the area around Leric live a strikingly often the biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many old people live here in the South?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
On the contrary, the director of the museum of Fatuljeva believes that it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talys, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, it does not seem plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cizemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, resides Rubab Mirzayeva.
At 97, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a buttermilk that he cradles tirelessly.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and daughter. They are both grandparents a long time ago.
There are also two young children around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical belly glasses "armad".
The white teeth of Mirzayevs form a perfect line and hides a long dark blonde copy under the scarf, which is proudly uncovered in front of us by her son.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look like it and kept color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension to live is enough
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven’t bought food at the supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst part was during the Second World War.
But everything improved when the oar was taken over by the "beloved father" Geidar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is made around the figure of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took possession of the oar.
At least the elderly people in Azerbaijan do not suffer from a lack.
Mirzayeva receives a pension of 230 manates each month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is a matter of here, from which you can enjoy well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-grazed son is right: “The elderly people enjoy great seriousness in our culture.”
They live in the middle of a big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
If it's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The unspoiled demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the country's deep ambivalence.
A future constitution based on Sharia law is being discussed sharply.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And for succeeding in doing so, I am responsible, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but above all to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, still hopelessly quarreted in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "god-state" on the Nile issued at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi almost apoloskaya said he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own to "save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctor’s degree in Southern California, really saves, doesn’t even know the world.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
The 234 paragraphs, which the hundred-headed Constituent Assembly with the predominance of Islamists havetily approved in the 15-hour night marathon, partly arouse concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that the jurisdiction is based on "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that the Islamists will use this unclear wording and the associated legal free space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, this is explained by the newly added paragraph: In all matters related to Sharia, it is necessary to consult the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a major influence on all Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight of legislation, which would bring the judiciary a factual withdrawal of legal capacity.
In the draft constitution, many things are of interpretation
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of military courts is to continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, there were up to 11 000 civilians in military custody.
As the proposal stands, the state should also protect the "right essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values."
This is legal formulated so inaccurately that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature using this paragraph.
In comprehensible language, this means nothing but censorship.
After all, no paragraph defines in writing the explicit equality of men and women.
On the other hand, another paragraph forbids the defamation or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
Unclear, however, remains what is defamation and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally doubtful is the wording that "insulting people" is prohibited.
In this case, is the caricature of the president or a joke on behalf of the law experts?
The matter of interpretation, as much more in this proposal, which Morsi submits for signature and, in his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of a popular vote.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks, the opposition has been forming against the outnumber of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual concord on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it comes into effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hampin Sabbahi, who came in third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Prize winner and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradei said the draft constitution belongs "on the dustbin of history".
Through the short-move service, Twitter accused supporters of Morsi wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy."
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition officer Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a defiance of a sub-demonstration, but out of caution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
She was attended by many veiled women and supporters of Salafists who called: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called on Morsi, "Clear the land!" and assured, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square Tahrir, on which everything began, would probably provoke a state of similar civil war.
It was Mursi's followers clearly who didn't want to take any chances.
The Muslim Brotherhood said the opponents and supporters of the constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country should go.
The majority is considered certain in favor of the Islamists' proposal.
"The word 'human rights' don't occur once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, is viciously blamed by Hafiz Abu Sa'du.
A forty-eight-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or standing trial.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beat, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution, the words 'human rights' are not even once," he complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag."
Morsi's expansion of power to all three power forces in the state has forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are scandalous offenses against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the president strengthening civil society, he effectively canceled it," Sa'da complains.
Without civil society, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which follows the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire on him.
The protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian rafficis: The most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country be associated with the local appetite for an extraordinarily stinking fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it lie for a week.
Thus, you get a sense of paralyzing the smell of gaffic, one of Norway's largest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a wonderful view - and there is a ubiquitous odor hanging in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trough fermented in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and getting cold, the Norwegians are beginning to meet here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, to the most captivating food.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk general" who is responsible for the course of the festival.
All around us, people eat little cubes fish and drink them with plenty of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit than a krakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can overcharge the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus journey.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators, the fish were dipped in the autumn in an airtight barrel with water and salt.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses no doubt dulled with alcohol.
Before just one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by a large amount of labor, high earnings and a large-scale care system.
The people of Sweden, an old rival who was much richer than Norway until recently, is flowing into the country for work.
The garaks are viewed as something important, indispensable, albeit a fairly smelly part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or sandwiches will cost you $9 pound ($14) apiece.
Norway often does not get into global news - and it seems to suit most people.
The name Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot dead 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioning with distaste.
Instead, the shooting is called "an event of 22. July." "
Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway's current wealth lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the early 70's of the 20th century.
"But oil is not the only reason we're doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, representing a prototype of Nordic's well-being with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes.
We are, as they say, judicious people.
Her English, like the English of most people here, is absolutely impeccable.
We're not showing up, we don't like the pomp.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from the sector is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading to the global financial crash was squandering the money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had the strings tightly tightened on their purses.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat garakfisk," he adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for something to eat - I've had enough of the greed.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But the evening is the smelly fish here again.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where coffin is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather the most demanding fish for their senses.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast in which there is a presenter with a bow tie surrounded by plates with gaffic.
It's like a Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by aquavit.
Or maybe fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a tough start
As the incoming Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers were erected, closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the goal was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a difficult task.
Mexico has fared well economically at the time of the outgoing Felipe Calderon's time, but the country is in the clutches of the drug war, which has already taken an estimated 60 000 lives a victim in six years.
"My government has a great commitment against the Mexican people to reduce violence," President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he shook hands with the U.S. president, Pen Niet gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions on the new leader are different even in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A direct man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in a good way.
Citizens attribute to him the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city by one of the new motorways that Pen Nieto had built. These highways are a huge improvement over the leaky and bumpy roads that were here before.
The boards with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum with the themes of climate change.
"We expect it to bring about a real and lasting change," says Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of state for President Pen Niet, the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in security and the economy that our country needs so badly.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, many are expected within the party from the Enrique Pen Niet.
And it rejects the expression of the opposition characterizing the new president as a person with no substantial content.
He is a very straight lined man, very biased with the excellent vision of the country.
He is a great statesman and, above all, is a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that many people have from its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo can not be more evident.
Tungling under highway overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the army was called in to help manage drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially pressing violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in deserted places in dispensing places.
At the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1 000 women were murdered in Mexico, much more than in the notorious violence city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murders of innocent women.
At best, Pen Niet's critics say he failed to address the problem of women's murders during his time in office.
And in the worst case, his leadership accuses his eyes.
In a concrete house typical of the dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna, and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believes her was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone washed her body," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of him after blows, and the posthumous stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they have been denied.
The state authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, troublemaker and whine.
They want you to simply accept what they say and remain silent.
"But that can't be right when there's been so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The sheerbe that President Pena Nieto receives on Saturday is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime, and the new president has promised that during his time in office they will be his priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," Pri Olvera said in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims regarding the rough treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in a military link in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of the rough treatment of Manning in prison.
Private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many options to complain about the rough treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutors have. Ashden Fein, during the cross-examination of the soldier Manning at a preliminary hearing in the Ft. Maede claimed in Maryland that the weekly visits Manning had with the officers of the unit during the nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of mistreatment.
The cross-examination, which occurred during a hearing carried out at the suggestion of the defense to dismiss the case against Manning for the reason of the rough treatment at the time of detention, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he contemplated suicide in custody.
An analyst of military intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is charged with theft of thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, passed forms that officers filled in after a meeting with Manning at the Quantico detention centre, where he was held under high security from July 2010 to April 2011.
Manning's officers asked questions and recording his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment on the part of his guards as "excellent" and rated the overall handling of the facility as "very professional."
The forms show no complaints about ill-treatment, even though Manning's officers have directly asked how he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about the various issues orally and that the officers who visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they had not seen these problems.
"They wrote down "number of problems" (after discussing the fears), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge plk. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 during a meeting with a committee assessing the suicidal idea he had expressed on the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime.
The army said it had used the restrictive regime (one degree under surveillance regime for suicide) to protect others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was OK and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so I could enjoy a higher quality of life, as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning on Thursday testified to his arrest in Iraq and transferring to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before being transported to a Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and fainted once there because of heat.
He stated that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very daunting.
"My world has only shrunk to the Arifjan base, to the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning said that upon arrival in Quantica, he spent most days (minimum 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, a slide-on, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against the rules during the day.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of his cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards could not see his face, when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was remantime in April 2011 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he made in Thursday's testimony regarding the fact that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other cellmates in the morning count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket.
During a hearing on Friday, Judge Manning said he had deducted from the orders of his guards that he had a blanket that he could cover himself, but admitted that no one had issued him an order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the night because he tried to show the officer he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his slippers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his slippers, and his glasses were removed from his cell the night.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience of his imprisonment and that in the event of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to begin early next year, he will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it planned to make Manning plead guilty to the lower crime and that he would fight the other allegations because they are too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the terms of detention as justified.
The Pentagon said Manning was held in accordance with regulations concerning all those arrested in custody with maximum security.
Allegations against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawfully causing the disclosure of news documents on the Internet, transmission of information related to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is charged on all counts, he can be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely broke through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexiconos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I was standing there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in central California and all my life I was called a "Mexican."
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York say "Italy."
So later I ended up with the label "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, it wasn't necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I do not have a vocabulary of a native speaker and I can not get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and queue for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking the moment when Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House this week.
On the agenda, they had the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why there is the same probability that the Mexicans will stay in Mexico as if they travel to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even if he had not provided any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader to rewrite half of Mexican territory into the United States under threat of weapons.
But for Mexicans who have been thinking in the span of centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after a U.S. official says something just a little critical of Mexico, you'll hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the elite about how Americans interfere with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the Montezuma children will take the war trail.
And yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There are a lot of those.
In Mexico, there are both winners and losers, the people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others who do not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that at some point of our family tree, there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we are living an American dream now, we go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live an American dream, not a Mexican one.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and they see us as an inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is only a failure.
If our families in Mexico didn't fail, they would never leave it.
And we would not now be found to be imprisoned behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans dislike it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know do not feel like part of either.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best from both countries, but you don’t have roots in either.
In Mexico, he looks at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reunite with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how wonderful it is to visit this country and push for political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure it is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for how they negotiated with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel resentful for the way in which they were treated with their family members in a substantially closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
The Old Battles, the New Near East
Ending the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such happening is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary conjectures about who started it, many buildings were turned into ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza fell near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are captured in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this can interrupt their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that there are currently not many reasons for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire closed on November 21, this week's fights would be strengthened by hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim that they have forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of the 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the most deplorable and populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its hardened rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can say very well that time is on their side.
Islamists across the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a re-resumed regional power that was once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has joined Hamas. Likewise, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering Hamas people say that the Islamic crescent moon is huddling around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the Hezbollah party/militia rules, through Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly inclined to Islamism, can depose Bashar al-Assades, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
The Brotherhood, on the other hand, is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be expelled even by Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back into a crate.
Israel's Iron Dome Anti-Range Anti-Range System proved its worth, and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwar about as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the launch of the last round of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, there has been relatively calm in Israel from suicide bombing bombers, partly thanks to the wall that extends into the West Bank, the main part of what may be the Palestinian state once, and protects Jewish settlements, which are still growing despite their illegality from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, joined the election campaign on January 22 with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, they wouldn't fire rockets, like their compatriots in Gaza did?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
Perhaps hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than the spending of all its four Arab neighbors combined.
The launch of a new war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments heal their economy.
The fact that President Morsi has worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
Israelis should also look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, the denial of rights to the Palestinians is creating the self-determination of a keen barrel with gunpowder that must one day erupt in areas occupied by Israel - as well as the bus that erupted in Tel Aviv last week.
Already at present, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this situation as the Arab population is growing.
The bloody attacks against Gaza taking place every few years to push Hamas will increasingly take a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides proclaim, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states where Israel will advance territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping fire will provide pressures from the outside with at least a little greater influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must establish itself to stop the supply of weapons to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to embrace the idea of a 1967 Jewish state-based on borders with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from outside must also push for a consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has a share of how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back at the White House, he seems just as reluctant in his entry into the trial.
This is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in the stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Ugly Cigarette Packaging Laws Appears in Australia
On unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are depicted warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australian laws on ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the world's first kind, have been replaced by logos and brand colors, with general olive green boxes with heinous pictures of sick parts of the body and the depiction of babies and newborns sick as a result of smoking their parents.
In addition to the various health warnings and images, the only difference between the boxes are the names of the tags that are printed in the same small font.
It is the strictest regime in the world related to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by ridding the habit of its gravity.
It relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking until the age of 26, there's 99% chance they never start smoking.
"Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them together with their product," federal health secretary Tanya Plibersek said, citing studies that showed children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering taking similar steps.
The tobacco industry has been harshly lobbying against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation, there will be serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfegrims from China and Indonesia will bring many more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others say the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, small family businesses, said demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals to laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from near-zero sales.
Ha said that Zico has sold nearly 6 000 units to wholesale retailers and expects new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible snag, experts cite the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan focuses.
Across a string of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from a direct view, tobacco marketing has shifted online.
Australia has banned internet advertising carried out by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're a tobacco industry marketing officer and you only have this little space to promote your products, online space is an insurmountable place for you to be in," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman has seen an increase in the ratings of brands on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the trouble to create this video, or is that a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on how it handles new regulations than marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to invade new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly trade.
The SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments considering similar laws related to packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering tougher laws.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no influence on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You just take out a cigarette and stick the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of a tumor in your mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason to quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the newsagents of King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, argues that it is harder for him to level on the shelves.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, that's the end, let's close the shop', 'he said, and he threw his hands.
In a world of constant connectivity, it's not so bad to be bored
I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of the next plane.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction with books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly come up with the praise of boredom.
They say it's good to get bored for us (and our children).
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we have no chance to enjoy boredom.
Should we support boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back to that.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary of Canada, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011) says.
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After watching the research literature and presenting the idea to the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do that."
Boredom is distinguished from apathy by the fact that the person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there is no urge to do anything with apathy.
He says the heart of boredom is "disrupting the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and a feeling of slow-moving time."
Boredom can be very reminiscent of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see the problem as an environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem within themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study, The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention, which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape on which the person read the article from the journal.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV program in the next room, while others heard it so quietly that they could barely notice it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distraction can lead to boredom, Mark J said. Fencke, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "such as finding the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help make sure you don't get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and scribbling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight boredom and keep people more physically attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to wiggle will learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fencke said.
We've all experienced boredom sometimes - my flight delay, a humming speaker, a particularly lengthy movie.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 80's of the last century developed a "Scale for Susceptibility to Boredness" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions such as: "Many things I have to do is repeat and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodafone, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and various external stimulations.
Teenagers are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know whether the percentage of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knew that "adolescence is a peak time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Break is the way the brain tells you you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should do.
If you’re bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate management is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of the constant turkey of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restlessly desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly over-stimulating," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise turns off."
There's no guide to the new Marijuana law in Colorado
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a senior college student and a Southeast Colorado footballer, is facing felony charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said he was going one day in September with several friends in Lamar, on plains near the Kansas border when he was stopped.
After the officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offenses for which there is $100 for each fine - and a court date was set for him.
"They treated us like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on the legalization of a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends more on the spot than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana infringements have already been lifted here and in Washington state, which approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped blaming adults aged 21 and the elderly for possession of small quantities that will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative Colorado precincts have said they would continue to carry on existing cases involving marijuana, and are still blaming people for possession.
At the same time, several cities from the Denver suburbs towards the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their municipalities.
"This matter is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," Daniel J. said. Oates, the police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
The regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or for worse, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first for medical use and now recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," Brian E said. Smith, spokesperson for the advice on granting licenses to sell alcohol to the state of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith conceived, no place or system can do more than to suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent by which we can follow," he said.
The Washington Law, the so-called. I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possession does.
And there are tricky mechanical issues that must be resolved over this time, for example, how to balance the state directive on "adequate access" to licensed marijuana, banning cannabis trafficking within 330 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will be more difficult to place a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recent research group.
On November 21, Police Chief Oates sent an e-mail from the city of Aurora to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana for every citizen over the age of 21 and that the police "with immediate effect" would stop blatting people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the Weld County District of Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck is a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or fewer marijuana, although many are facing additional charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute the crimes that were criminal offences at the time they occurred," Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places like the Mesa country district, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in the Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer blame adults for holding small quantities.
District prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to dismiss all ongoing cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters have supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have revealed, with this great state green experiment, deep ambippe among local officials.
For district prosecutors, this is a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the accused of possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Marijuana Reform Organization.
"They spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become national test cases for legalizing the drug.
Defense lawyers and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Lawyers for the legalization of marijuana hope that the Justice Department will submit.
Despite several arrests of marijuana salesmen for medical purposes and patients who are taking it that attracted attention, the federal government mostly left stores with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to set off the door to catch a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will defy state-regulated shops with recreational marijuana allowed by the new laws, Kevin A said. Sabet, a former anti-drug adviser to President Obama's administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for the advancement of federal authorities.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana deals, even if it will take about a year to open any store.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to come into force next week.
"We don't mean to find ourselves in a situation where we give someone a license and then we're going to have a big federal matter out of it," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the municipality voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There really are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Only today’s university students are not attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming about studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university I thought was the world's largest seat of knowledge, a modern stained Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 80's of the twentieth century, two weeks after taking my onset at Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my bags and raided myself into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I gave up because I objected to the lovemaking of students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson said I left because I was forced to drink from battered mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or fact that I came home from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason alone, and in this cradle of the supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I support the Conservative Party.
You may ask why I'm bringing it up now.
Simply because the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students on the right of the center suffers from similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of Younger Years (JCR) at Corpus Christi College argue that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are indicated to them that they are not welcome."
They are seeking to create a position in the University Committee for Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that they can freely communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently released BBC Two documentary program called Wonderland: Young, Young, Young, Young, Young, and on the Right about the student political events, which portrayed the Conservatives as weirdos and neo-Nazis.
The show featured a graduate of Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA Conservative Association), who rode a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as "satian lambs" due to the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Nuttingham University), told Sunday newspapers that "the left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Twenty-one-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant," while Nineteen-year-old OUCA President Stephenie Cherilli says there has been a deterioration in the JCR's approach to the people on the right of the center.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a minority of a member.
I started in September 1986, 18-year-old and cripplingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most feverish.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse to award an honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher because of the cuts in the financing of higher education.
Even Stalinists would tremble with fears of the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the initial week, when new students meet each other and with professors, I got a taste of the wormwood that was to come.
I found that not only do professors silently approve of the teasing of conservative pupils, but also participate with gusto.
A politician of mining strike, privatization and opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were brought into the wood-panelled auditor mills.
My first lecture was about translating the French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now the late), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake dough, was very bile.
"The Thatcher refuses to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were giggleing.
Tears came into my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your free time, unless you're too busy with social matters," Muskdog.
I returned to my room.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight tapping on the shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, that's right.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to get worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later in the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted on not agreeing with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics, and economics who (what an irony) went to Eton, said: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students noted with him.
I was twisted, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're hitting each other, right?
I felt the same as homosexuals must have felt before liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life at Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to change into Labour and suppress my natural inclination?
Three years later, they developed before me as a purgatory of ignoring and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who resided in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of those writing her speeches.
He was almost not there.
He hated the place for his provinciality and pettiness, and because of his inclination to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he took the position of professor at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents' house in London seeking refuge with my unbiased Metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were received.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city's dreamy mood.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His weeping eyes gloe.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a prank.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a Conservative Party supporter, succumbed to pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week, during the course of teaching, when another professor of history in complete equilibrium declared that I was the "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I blushed in the inside with shame, I confessed that "parents brainwashed" and called them "Old Fools."
The relief was only short-lived.
My father hammered the nail into the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he was writing two columns in Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train in London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snot weak.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and poisonousness in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, however, it was Oxford, from which not only 14 Conservative prime ministers emerged, but which is also hidden to this day for an undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance than fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I. English, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the Valentin Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which represents more than 130 models of the ultimate fashion created by his studio over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but without his revered clients, it could not be written.
Valentino always felt enchanting the precious and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, is brimming with private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exposes these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the city of Vaugher in the north of Italy to an idol of the international "bohemian cream".
It is not a bad thing to have loved royal families.
"They at least don't mess your cigarette star in a great carpet, like some beautiful pop-music celebrities do," says Baronese Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 60's and 70's, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy a lot and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of the forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance rather than fame.
He’s still a star.”
Valeria Mazz shows off Valentina
The charisma of the designer is not forgotten by the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
"We've been a long time since we went to dinner after one parathesy in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy the Younger.
In every trifle of his apartment, decoration, food, music, he was revered in everything and his spirit felt.
Thanks to him, all those invited could feel important and loved," recalls the top model, who started working with him during the Paris Week of High Fashion in 1995.
"He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
A show of nobility
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but really reciprocal loves.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was converted into a distinctive seventy-meter-long passage that offers a roll exchange: the visitor turns into a model and marches through the passage to observe the "center" of dreams, which he wore to Valentin's masterpieces as a dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, a costume that was worn by Monica Vitti in "The Night" or coat.
The mannequins include Sibill of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norway, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and Designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is the first love, "can't be forgotten."
"I remember it perfectly.
It was pants, shirts, vest "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer muses.
"I give him priority to others for his femininity and great love for women, because it underscores our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors it uses, brightens a lot and give the "spark" of the face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she first put on Valentine.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she longed to be of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
She finally got to the end of the 90's.
"I bought my first Valentine dress to celebrate at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with ruffles, a folded bodice and a strapless top.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow of Rodrigu d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories that they have in them".
"King" of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Pavel Greek in 1995.
To create these silk dresses of ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and a siding four and a half meter long, four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstress).
According to journalist Suza Menkes, the greatest authority of a specialized press, this dress represents the milestone of the ultimate fashion of the late 20th century, the "return of clients from high society."
Valentino dazzled over the years with the elitist "savoid-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honors in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated with the Order of the Legion of Honour accumulates as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always attracted his choice, calmness, groomed and perfect appearance," admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was impeccable, time left no trace on him.”
When the princess says it...
The hardest craft in the world: sulphur carriers in the area of Kawah Ien volcano
For four euros, carriers in the area of the Indonesian volcano with their lives and health gambles are gambling when they endure 70 kilos of sulfath down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living from conquering sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, every day he has to stumble to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphurous gases escape from the inside of the Earth and, on contact with the air, pass into solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, he takes them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes over 40 minutes exhausted carriers to climb the turtle pace, as they maintain balance and thoroughly reflect their steps so that they do not slip and crash into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who crashed from the Kawah Ien Rocks years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine
When they are up, they make their way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and wearily carry heavy baskets to the scale, which the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is a company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
Then it sells for 10 000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar bleaching.
"Because we normally carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," Anto explains to us, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes three hours and at the end it is destroyed, but he can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even though it seems like a negligible amount for such inhumane efforts, it is three times what it would earn in the field.
"The daily wages of miners are very high here. For example, 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid for collecting coffee, and the salary per fortnight is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near a volcano, for a serious reason that is as persuasive in Indonesia as sulfuile: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to the Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's sick, he doesn't give a damn, he's still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks her life in the Kawah Ien volcano three times a day, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on it, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises more than decent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, a fate afflicted, could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist in a hotel, and instead does the work of a carrier.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up at two o'mis every day, because the sulfur does not stop bursting at night, and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto stumbles into the crater and illuminates his path with a small flashlight, which he has attached to his helmet and bought it for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry on the shoulders of a basket with sulphurous from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high revenues, it has not mechanized sulfur mining due to cost savings, nor does it provide to carriers working on its own and with such effort, no equipment.
In fact, they do not even receive a share of 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the surcharge for photography, which, together with a ticket for 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros), are selected by the natural park guards from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for cattle, and not for the people," argues Madrusin, a sturdy 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ini for three decades, since he left schools.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he can keep working "as long as he can," because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfuria burns the throat and bites in the eyes when the wind unexpectedly turns and traps the miners in the dense fumes that come out of the volcano, miners are thus claiming that none of them complain that they suffer from serious diseases... but it is obvious from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
A nauinik, who balances his basket on his back, can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues extract 15 tons of sulphurous in the volcano, which then take three trucks take a steep road between the thicket to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainic says, opening a broad mouth that lacks several teeth.
Of his five sons, the eldest, thirty-year-old, also earns by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the ever-constructive misery of one of the world’s heaviest crafts persists from generation to generation – the crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame for not having children, for career, stress and livelihood and education costs.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot. We will fulfill our civic duty and beget a new life!
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of an advertisement for menthol candies, but still - or perhaps that's why - the video in Singapore earlier this year has spread widely on YouTube.
These sentences are part of rap that uses local allusions such as "we put the bun in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
The agency's artistic director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people do their civic duty.
"This is exclusively a matter of the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch.
We knew that the government was trying a lot to do, like, to expand perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought why not to do the most creative possible thing, like the composition of rap, to solve this problem.”
1.2 children
Anyone who doesn't take much of it lightly is the Singaporean government.
Every year, they spend $1,300 to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15 000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates of financial benefits.
But all these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a wealthy urban state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its representatives’ conservatism and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why do Singaporeans don’t have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National Population's Department of Marriage and Family, says it's because of "better education" and a "wider range of career opportunities."
"People have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, it's not just a wedding and family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the postponements of marriage and the prolifesion of children. The result is a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there were efforts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against a decline in population, it caused displeasure among locals.
Some Singaporean websites show an undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping salaries and making a little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the ruling Singapore party recorded its worst electoral result since the beginning of independence.
After the election, there was an effort to solve the problem using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, some unexpected consequences have also occurred in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "botbotines" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in the marketability.
However, there is a fear that these apartments can support a bachelor's lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, claims that their "shoeboxes" are selling far faster than larger homes.
"They're more popular, by selling days to weeks faster than houses with a larger area.
That’s why they’re much better for our cash flow.”
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules to developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules could aim to increase the birth rate of the nation, an interview with Singaporeans working in a city-centered financial district suggests they will not have much effect.
"People are still stressed, houses are expensive, as well as education, that's why many people put it off," says the young official.
"Others should have children.
But for me, it's important to rely on my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old, a young man.
Both men and women mention careers, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is, in the end, Singaporeans who have the last word on starting a family.
What's Private Offline is Private and Online
Privacy.
According to the diction of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something that has a personal nature or "an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disturbance."
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily lives and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriodico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the notion of privacy to be "something entirely inherent" on a personal level and a "username and password" if they were social networks.
"My biggest secret wouldn't be disclosed," says ten-year-old Jorge, an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she claims.
"On FB, I'm posting nice photos or photos of us playing.
I'm talking to my friends there, too.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine or a photo that would ridicule someone," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscenes photographs, photos of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or gross comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
There is also a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I set up a Twitter account so I can express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I'm just putting them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone to him.
The case of fourteen-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latest network mentioned admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them guided him to anything, nor did he want an address or phone number from him.
"If they urged me or demand it from me, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading a Twitter recommendation.
This boy is not a foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying.
"A well-known friend was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who he was," he confirms.
The victim did not log out of the bill, according to José.
"Just activated the private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of acquaintances in unpleasant or awkward situations.
"Of course I would do it if someone bothered me or I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyber bullying," he claims.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that in order to properly orientate children and adolescents in social networks, they need to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them.
He states that "The Internet originated as a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic spectator Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are just learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what, on the contrary, not, at an age when they are not yet mature for it."
Also, to be - in terms of the surroundings - to be prudent, at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, asking questions that make them think.
"Calls them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: Are there things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo the way you posted a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you refer to the people in the photos from the celebrations, did you ask these persons for permission?
And one more thing: Do they all need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the same way outside the Internet.
They're the same rules.
“One outside the Internet is governed by respect, morality and other principles, and it should be the same on social media,” he said.
Surveition
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-grade teacher and an educational counselor explaining that it is essential that the parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand every trick, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences that you can have on the Internet to open an account.
For example, when it comes to age or what is allowed to be shared or disclosed," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "not to talk to strangers."
South America summit ends and Lima statement not published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without issuing a Lima Declaration that was announced and which was allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of U.a. states and Unassur heads of state, but representatives of the State Department and the presidential office, who initially stipulated that they would publish the document after the summit ended, they said it would be published later on the Peruvian government website.
They further said the content was published by Peruvian President Ollantou Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential assembly without sound was transmitted in the press room with a message "confidential session, audio transmission prevented."
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press spokespersons of some governments who were present, but not by Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participating presidents, which sparked the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets asking for more information.
Later, Peruvian's presidential office sent an email to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but this is only a statement by President Humala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion the originally promised Lima Declaration was not disclosed, even though it was zealously demanded by the press.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but to completely prevent the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment to Chile and Peru to accept the judgment of the Hague Court, which resolves a dispute over the border between the two countries.
President of Peru Ollanta Humala and Chile President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting to confirm that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday will begin by hearing the defense of both sides to discuss the dispute launched by Lima against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute we are discussing in this international court today," President Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country respectful of international law, peaceful dispute resolution, conventions and international courts," Piñera added, greeting President Humala with a handshake at the flags of the two countries.
The two presidents' confirmation of the rulings of the International Court of Justice was made public after Colombia took the Bogota Pact this week, expressing the subjugation of the international court ruling out on the maritime border with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered the decision entirely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur's 2011 after the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was commissioned to open morning speeches and conclude a summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, in which he informed that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects between South American countries were planned, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreeds adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR member countries would take "important steps towards an objective in the form of South American citizenship, due to which the agreements on residence are extended."
He said actions were supported to improve "collaboration in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, to better availability of medicines and the cheap internet in all corners of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, “it does not have the economic consolidation (Latin America) a victorious essence, but is intended to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future.”
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links of various places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and to form new economic ties," the Peruvian president said in a speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and the transverse axes of its territories from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to a better connection with Ecuador, but did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return to the Union of South American peoples" from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit needed Latin America to remain a thriving and peaceful area that has a good neighbourly relationship.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before taking part in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the maritime border dispute, which is questioned by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor the contract with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortego that we conduct the negotiations as much more civilized and considerate possible form," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are scheduled to take part in the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Niena.
As part of the summit, EU defence ministers met provisionally to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the country in question is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that creating a joint citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case really, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, declared on state television TV Perú that Europeans "have killed themselves during World War 2" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which member countries support Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean community, but there are still backward areas that want to return us to the past," he said.
The Ecuadorian president said he agreed with the regrouping of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states is reduced and those who signed the Human Rights Pact will take into account.
"Thousone in the lead never commits to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is funded by the United States in Washington," WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in an allusion to political asylum provided by Ecuador.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that at the time "there was reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary, who asked him to undergo interrogation in Swedish territory for alleged sexual offences, while "the Swedish legislation allows the interrogation of a videoconference call that could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that both Assange’s physical and mental health would worsen.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he's having minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But there is a risk that his physical and mental state will deteriorate because he is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving in the fresh air.
That would affect everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, stressing that there were talks with London to resolve the imprisonment of WikiLeaks' founder.
“We are not negotiating about human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón conducts a series of proceedings in various European instances," he said.
He said, "if the UK issues a pass tomorrow, everything will end."
And if Sweden hears Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or Skype, as the legislation there allows and, as has already been done in other cases, this issue will be made tomorrow."
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, and explained that he certainly did not tolerate "under-average, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, the wicked and perverted politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed joy at the fact that neither such journalists, "neither bankers nor hegemony countries nor the bourgeoisie speak Ecuador", and he stated that if he is re-elected, "he will continue to change in the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to further maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay on Union membership of Unasur at least until its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coupice draped into legality," because in fact he "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
In addition, the Ecuadorian president said he considered "a perfectly appropriate" wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, after the ruling by the International Court of The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
The verdict is not currently accepted.
“This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly in order to be overcome and there is an opportunity to move forward.”
He also expressed his hope in the settlement of the dispute over the maritime border, which he is addressing in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek out international instances if the two countries commit to accepting the judgment, no matter how harsh it is."
In connection with the possibility of running in the next presidential election in Ecuador, to apply for the third term, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said if he loses the election in February 2013, he would leave public life.
“Personally, I’ve never been interested in the power, but such an unfair situation as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I had won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, the same thing awaits me.
I've already made up my mind," he said.
Correa also mentioned new health treatments for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
"I have just spoken to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says President Chavez went on a scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a recurrence in the president's state of health," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state today took part in the sixth summit of heads of state and the governments of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are the result of a late diagnosis today
Fabrizi was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning struck me," he recounts in the memory of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "mile" a little, but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from the family.
He decided to take his illness alone on his shoulders and began to inform himself of it. And with such dedication that he's already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most pop patients in the Civilian Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several fights with the disease.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and a larger stigma.
At that time, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are a lot of people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused the destruction of the body and has exhausted the immune system, and then they become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS, or at least the first documented cases, “a great success is that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment on time and appropriately is exactly the same as in healthy people,” said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, saying that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Andrade Villanueva, an HIV/AIDS specialist, explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that survival and full-time life depend on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, and better off those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that those who are diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 may, according to these findings, "live without problems up to 75 years of age," the doctor explained in an interview.
To emphasize this progress, it should be recalled that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is 76 years old today.
Although mortality rates have decreased significantly in recent years and in the case of Mexico the number of people who died from AIDS fell from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (yearswide United Nations Common Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people have died in 2011 and so far 187 by May this year. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
Why do people continue to die from the disease?
- "It appears to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
In the last 12 years, we have not exhausted the stock of medicines. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the state of the disease, i.e. in the late stage of the disease."
Adds a persuasive figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection is already manifested. The only thing that needs to be done to be able to more influence the overall mortality rate is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore it is necessary to offer on a large scale to tests to detect the disease to all those who apply for them.”
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State AIDS Prevention Council in the state of Jalisco, as well as directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who came to have tests done to a private laboratory just because his friend did it, and despite his young age, he has already broken out AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
“Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather have three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthy, I exercise, I take medication.”
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
“I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who has accepted the call to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today as part of World AIDS Day.
"Let them get tests done. If they took the risk, let them know as soon as possible, if they are HIV positive, it's better. And if they've been diagnosed, let them realize they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a large gap between programs for health and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, an guadalayar journalist who is looking into information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task "has indeed increased the distribution of condoms, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages even a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want for?" is a common question of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and medical staff who want to avoid teens, the reporter says.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution. Let the condoms not just be behind the counters, but let the hundred be in dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“It’s not a promiscuity support.
Nor does it matter them to "pay beer and motel" how Governor Emilio González reacted when asked if he would agree to divide the condoms in his district.
There is no such sexuality. It is best to make condoms accessible to those who already lead a sex life," he noted.
Key figures in Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This condition means fourth place in Mexico in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of infections take the sexual route, 6% blood flow by 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50 thousand people can live with HIV, as for one registered case there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
A judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise Grupo Vitro's debt restructuring set by the bankruptcy in Mexico, raises an unfortunaticulsive precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighbouring country and solvency problem.
Thus, it seems that the procedures for restructuring companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in a country of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
Approval of the judgment delivered 15. In June last year, Judge Harlin Halo at the bankruptcy court for northern Texas leaves Mexican companies defense against the possibility of confiscating their assets on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door to the United States Supreme Court of the United States for Mexico's chief manufacturer of glass, citing three irregularities.
At the beginning, it must be said that while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to abide by the Insolvency Act of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth District, based in New Orleans, says the main procedure is set by bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would show ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of intranational business insolvency.
In essence, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, which determines the American Law Institute by the Arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without the vote of branches from the internal corporate structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro vis-à-vis the branches is recognised, the required majority would not be reached for the approval of the restructuring.
However, this possibility is permitted by Mexican laws.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples like Agromex and Comercial Mexican, for whose in-house debts the Federal Bankruptcy Institute guaranteed.
Moreover, it is true that even after deducting the votes of the branches, creditors - who opposed Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. "supports" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not have reached the majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This figure is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court accusoded Vitro of the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
In the meantime, the family-owned company Gonzáleza Sady will appeal for the new assessment directly to the Court of Appeal to take place with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because initially only three voted.
If he fails here, he will, as an appeal, demand a revision of the higher instance process, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The case is serious that the court omitted the document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae unit, which describes Vitro's procedure under the Bankruptcy Act in detail, pointing out that the company has made it easier by inclined to the agreements signed by the two countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. rules intended for international insolvency cases guarantee equality for both debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and state.

Unnoticed, a criminal complaint by the Mexican aviation unions against the former owner of Gaston, Azcarraga Andrad, who was accused of fraudulent conduct, lay on the table for several months, and according to the pilots' union, the vessel had already overflowed.
The instance, headed by Carlos Díaz Chavez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which he accuses of obstructing justice.
According to her, the Audit Office systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor General of the Republic on a transaction made by this entrepreneur, in which he collected 198 million pesos from the Fideicomo F/589 bank on behalf of Mexican Aviation.
The funds were probably directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional Management of Hotels (Administradora Profesional de Hotelses).
As is well known, Azcarraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of an association met at the weekend in the weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankun.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge trading and distribution center with products from "country with a big wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Earlier, the organization Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose a monumental area that would partially devastate the protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
The end of the issue with the ACTA document
The request of the Senate, which the government did not take into account and which demanded an explanation under the conditions and circumstances under Japan, the Mexican-in-counter Trade Agreement, known as the English acronym ACTA, was made to the Mexicano de la Propeeded Industrial Industrial International Affairs.
As is known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it as a threat to freedom of expression on social media.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world-butter Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world through it.
Fe few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was tied to a wheelchair in 2008 before he was attracted to a wheelchair in 2008, aged for more than 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, a BSN national basketball player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamoón team in the national basketball league, or the president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
"I held a lot of roles in basketball in the course of my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the national BSN, the general executive of the national team and the president of the federation in the 90's," Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora newspaper reporters at his home in Bayamoon, where he has lived with Isabel for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not overdo it in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest emotion of all, he guards those that commemorate his work in the draw Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
“That was my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967, whether as an owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his debut at BSN.
That's when the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said in a statement.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was here previously coached and at the time at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, told me: "I have a two-meter-long player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the start of Minty, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me quarterback Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy would bring Bayamon a victory in the championship, Gausse will then contribute to the next one.”
The championship, when the Los Vaqueros team played Gauss, enjoyed, but only remotely, because in 1988 he was already the president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy's placement in the national team.
“I remember the first defeating the United States in the 1989 qualifying Olympic match in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Championships, where we finished fourth, but we should have had bronze not for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw-in," Reyes said.
Is the team from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba when we won the gold and we slammed the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that bloomed our bronze at the World Championships.
The team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also there were youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francico and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have had a perfect composition, but managed to win us a gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Argentina's Neuquén.
With players on the roster such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitinner, who replaced players excluded due to a scuffle in the Pan-American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico has achieved such results as Piculín at this level.
Not to mention his work in various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican Coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arillo's work very much.
Which success in the federation do you consider greatest?
That I was part of the national team's most famous era between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national BSN league had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you not manage?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a division of youth categories by region.
For example, the Ponce guys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in the compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing now?
I listen to music the most, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died
Born on September 21, 1931, Larry Hagman, forth Worth in Texas, is world-famous for John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, embodied a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as a predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewinga in the TV series Dallas became a symbol of a slaid in the 80's, he died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in a new series of Dallas this year, died according to the official family's announcement provided to the Associated Press by the Dallas production company Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon for cancer-related complications.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked the most," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was a representative of his wife in both the original and new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in the Dallas hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane said in a statement.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind and talented, and I'm going to miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in an announcement.
The Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found to have a malignant tumor on his liver, and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series, Hagman rose to fame on television as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie aired by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (a jin) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also protagonist in two comedies that were broadcast only briefly, and The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in the films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterful performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R., who led him to the star peak.
CBS's drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot the Geiara?", which was supposed to spark anticipation of a work full of emotions, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculations to viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in security offices.
It also helped this episode to reach the record in ratings.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers. Dallas became the second most-watched entertainment show in history after the 1983 broadcast of the MASH series, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
On J.R. shot his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin got pregnant with J.R., and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy with a charismatic smile: a cunning businessman and an unfaithful husband who was trying to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, to be locked up in a hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
There should be, "Here lies an honorary citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"The filming of five episodes of the second row has already been completed and the sixth was just spinning," the television station said.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT on how the series would continue.
The Fort Worth native in Texas was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman, in 1931.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on the theatre scenes in New York, and then from 1952 to 1956 he served in England in the Air Force.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The married couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and for a long time they lived in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt anyone or harm them in any way," He told the Prensa Associada news agency.
After the liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital, where he helped the fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give courage, I meet with them when they go into surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it's going to be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
A course that explores the "end of the world" begins
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When the professor of religion, Stuart Charmé, decided to do this semester a course about the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long count" of the Mayan calendar, which is due to come on December 21, many people have caught themselves as proof that the end of the world was coming.
Charmee, however, had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call "a debt Armageddon," and the growing conflict into which Israel is dragged, a place in which, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever been like," Charmé told students of Rutgers University of Camden, New Jersey.
When one discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we had 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for the apocalyptic-minded good.
And this is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, assistant professor Barry Vacker is organizing a course "Measures, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're discussing why these ideas expand with time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that control certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war can break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, believable and impossible," says Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Matthew Restall, a professor of Latin American history, and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, put together to organize a course with the simple title of the End of the World.
"We don't attach "2012" because we always count on the possibility of organizing the course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction," students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work "just until the evening of the expected end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It stretched into two hours," Restall said of his course for high-diameter students, who signed up to 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mail questions about whether there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, said at Rutgers University in Camden.
Thus, apocalyptic, secular or religious beliefs is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which to teach it," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the end date of December 21.
"Our first project was about Mayan predictions and we're refuting it in a certain way," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final year student at Temple at West Chester Temple University.
"The Mayans have never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point on the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back a few centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings with predictions about the end of the world.
The boom of speculation was caused by the Internet.
"People don't think about it any other way," he said.
This is most of the time in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who lectures in the Philippines this year, when asked if he knows about a course about the "end of the world," he quickly replied quickly.
"Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the highest office.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there was talk of many days of the last judgment, and he said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several said they intended to go to the festivities of the "ending the world."
"I'll probably call some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a twenty-year-old communications student.
