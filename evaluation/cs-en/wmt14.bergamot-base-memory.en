Economia and the Centre connect management.
They will offer, for example, a common advertisement
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Karlín, Prague.
Economia has taken another step to transform the Centrum holding into its media house.
Since Friday, both Economia and the Centre have joint top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishers into a common media house," comments the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Economie and the authorized CEO Kamil Čermák.
Čermák, who will lead the unified management, will be joined by the executive director of Centrum Holdings Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopařil was appointed as the new joint director of the business, to which the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Tylčerová, is also subordinate.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of the editors is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team also includes the director of transformation Jakub Unger.
The newly established position of Director of Marketing was commissioned by Adéla Pitts.
The independent corporate communication department is newly managed by Věra Lhotská.
The joint CFO is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the content creation of all published titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the business management of the company," Čermák added.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, has entered into an agreement to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this April.
The Centrum Holdings portfolio consists of the servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and the SMB agency Najisto or a portfolio of almost two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, news server IHNED.cz, weekly magazines Respekt and Ekonom and a number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in the sale of digital versions of its major titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CNN: Israel bombs military base in Syria
The target was Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military jets on Thursday reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia.
This was reported by CNN, citing an unnamed U.S. government official.
The Israeli press reported the explosion in the alleged missile storage facility, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
An Israeli military spokeswoman, when asked by CNN, declined to comment on the airstrike.
"We are not commenting on foreign media reports," she said.
The target of the Israeli airstrike, according to a U.S. government source, was rockets and related equipment that, in the Israelis' view, could be transported to the militant Lebanese movement Hezbollah.
The AP, citing another U.S. security official, reported that the target of an Israeli raid on a target on Syrian territory was Russian SA-125 missiles.
A second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack, however, according to the DPA, showed a battery of Russian missiles of the type S-125 Neva.
In addition, they said, the batteries of the SA-3 missiles, including the command center with radar to track missiles and their targets, were visible.
The recorded rockets have a range of 35 kilometers, according to an Israeli television report, and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and the AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly said it will involve any supply of weapons to Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that a return is unlikely.
In a late-night interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic politics.
Since June 2007, when he resigned after a decade in a leadership position, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks on British politics and has limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an envoy of the Free-Tier Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his response was quoted by the London-based newspaper Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but that's probably hard to come by, right, so..."
Police evacuated part of Los Angeles airport over shooting
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of this, allegedly being terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media, says the law enforcement men shot with the rifle of an armed man.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to police, said there was a firefight in which two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration were wounded.
How many people were injured and whether there were any victims but it is still not clear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more injuries.
Berdycha and Štěpánek will be joined by Rosol and Hájek
Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek nominated the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players for the Davis Cup final against Serbia.
Czech representatives defend the trophy, but go to the field of playing opponents in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
In the final, the Czechs are for the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going on hot ground, that it's going to be wild and we have to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with only one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Stepanek, the architect of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors to space in a new digitarium
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can bury themselves in new comfortable seats and above their heads added a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the whole device is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"This is twenty-one computers that generate a picture," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno Observatory.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a comprehensive impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of classic personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician at the observatory.
The digital arm can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, human body or ocean floor.
Viewers find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a person.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to screen the purchased shows and their own work in the hall.
There have been two shows on the agenda since Saturday.
The first is called the Astronaut and is designed for adults.
In it, people learn about astronaut training, fly into space, turn on centrifuges, and then see how challenging the conditions of astronauts face in space.
The second show is for children and is called The Magic Cliff - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the eruption of a nearby volcano.
The whole digitarium cost about fifty million crowns, which was paid mostly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory contributed smaller amounts from its budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed by audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory went through two years ago.
According to Director Dušek, between 25 and 30 thousand visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
Supreme Court backs Obama's health care bill
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a vote of 5:4, the court ruled that the individual order of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise they are at risk of paying a fine – do not contradict the Constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
Court President John Roberts stood on the side of the four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the remaining parts of the 2700-page bill and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which orders states to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise there is a risk of losing all funding for sickness insurance from federal sources, not coercive and in violation of the Constitution.
The lawsuit was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises in order to block this law.
During the 2012 primaries, the bill strongly rejected each of the major Republican candidates, including presumed proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
Naďa Konvalinková in the role of a pub.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Naďa Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a pub and she was very good at it.
Would a popular Czech actress plan to change her profession and start a pub business?
Naďa Konvalinková appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and made a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and I was good at it.
Even the boss offered to hire me and I could make a living spinning beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stay with what I still do to this day," Konvalinková, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub, revealed with a smile.
"I like Irish beer and sometimes I'll have Irish whiskey," the actress revealed.
Nadi's long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I can't boo about my new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one shot a day, and I'm trying to keep that," the actor added.
Egypt puts first free president elected in office
Muhammad Morsi has taken the inaugural oath, but his triumphant day is hard to end with political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was inaugurated as the country’s first free president, after Hosni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
In his appointment before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy approximately 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges dressed in black gowns in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are aiming for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the U.S. and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by individual governments for most of its 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived in a small column of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time, hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak's period, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the column could pass through a usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, mockingly referred to as the Muslim Brotherhood’s non-charismatic “reserve tire”, has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate for the Islamists, but also of all those who want to bring to an end the revolt against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to the judges in a wood-panled chamber where he took the oath.
Mursi later travelled to Cairo University, where he was due to deliver an inaugural speech.
While he was at attention, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander of Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by a chant of "the army and the people are one hand" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre of secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square on Friday, at the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly promised to once again seize the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took them over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he yielded to the will of the military, suggesting that the struggle for power would continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
If you really want to know a city, you should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through a načany center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than a bedeker would reveal.
Many people "read from graves."
Slowly, cemeteries roam and gain intimate insight into local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what are the beliefs, how large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their taste is.
And from the state of the graves, he will also find out how the bereaved cared for their dead.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up late and show off to the neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a scrooge.
There hasn't been candy in my apartment for two years, and this year it's probably not going to be any different.
However, statistics show that I am, when it comes to Halloween, a black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans – in fact, 158 million of them – will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and ornaments.
What I look forward to every Halloween is trendy.
According to the NRF, out of the 6.9 billion dollars spent, 1.2 billion are expected to go to costumes.
This year, the latest fad of fashion is sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy no longer just women; even dishes like pizza, hamburger and carrots can be sexy.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies thanks to the procession of the dead, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my surprise we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes for pets.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's roughly 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers sweets and Clark sticks.
This is amazing news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to raid our neighborhoods.
In fact, during Halloween we will buy, and believe, we will consume and consume, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Confectionery, nearly 16 thousand tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never deciphered.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls", which is, by the way, a real prison) "Howl-O-Scream" and "The house of shock."
In fact, there are officially dedicated 1200 haunted houses in the United States that, according to American Spooky Houses, have a profit of 500 million dollars, and that includes those amazing photos that you are wet with fears and that your friend will put on Facebook, and you can’t delete them, and the person you like will review the photo and write a comment like “nice face.”
And finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
Even when we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to a big pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving a pumpkin lantern is something like decorating a Christmas tree – we’ve been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the trend of “children in pumpkin” started thanks to the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up on the fact that we carved the gourd instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
A pumpkin lantern with a flicker on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245 thousand tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut up their pumpkin weighing nearly one ton.
How the insects from Thailand picked up the sales of the Paris bar
You may be sneering over insects and you have no idea that you eat it about half a kilogram a year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you have taken care of a unique experience.
The offer of insects was included first in Paris on the menu of his business in early October by Elie Daviron, the cook and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu.
The bar, whose title was inspired by William Burroughs's book Naked Lunch, you would find a widely visited tourist in the fashionable 18th district near Montmartre.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, guests can now eat not only various larvae, grasshoppers or water beetles, you can also taste scorpions.
Carefully and specially packed deliveries (so that insects do not damage their wings, do not damage their feet or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneering menu lists several reasons to consume insects.
The first is the ecological benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes a pleasure, a feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just conveying a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be impressed by the idea of eating a beetle decorated with pesto, but the reactions of the customers of the Paris bar to the served insects are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics will eventually taste it, even when they start with the smallest bites and eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing your hands will change your MOOD.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an insoluble task.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed its hands after the failure seemed much more optimistic than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
The "washed hands" group also did better in the next test than the other.
Still, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not have them washed.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not record any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test indicate that physical purity removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, the motivation decreases, the tested must concentrate much more in the next tests.
If we transferred the results of the research to the Czechs, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs do not wash their hands, but after travelling by public transport, it is already a fifth.
He usually also clings to hygiene after work in the garden or in the workshop, when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
The pet's caress motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after handshaking a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks will wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands roughly ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," said skin doctor Claudia Komárková.
A tunnel for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railway was found
It managed to discover one of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railways.
U.S. authorities described a tunnel measuring roughly one by one meter as one of the most sophisticated secret corridors they had ever discovered.
The tunnel, which winds into the length of nearly six football fields, connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses, where trucks can be easily hidden before being loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be delivered undetected in it.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
If convicted, he faces prison sentences of between 10 years and life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which puts a problem in front of drug cartels on how to get its product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor about 650 metres in length equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Is the European elite ready for trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to bring businesses together and define what changes in the relationship with the EU British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov interviewed 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing British businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while EU states are stagnant.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get bogged down in the long and strenuous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific political areas – from monopolistic regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area – 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies, expressed their approval.
And finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to strive to change the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, identified by businesses of different sizes and core business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for a “meaningful change” that will bring influence back to Britain.
There's a lot at stake - achieving a treaty change and a better deal for Britain can make a gain of up to 16% when voting in a referendum to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that the British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British membership of the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift from the current balance of forces back towards Britain.
A better deal for Britain is perhaps, and given how the eurozone is embarking on a journey beyond a closer economic and fiscal union, even more urgently.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority, and as the results of our survey show, for business this means re-focusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.

The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin once the first phase is launched in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together."
Scotland's transport minister, Keith Brown, said he was "excited" by working with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After completing Phase Two, he will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government re-evaluated the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which held talks with the national transport firm Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to identify additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of eventual travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or fewer hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that will better connect the UK and its cities."
We have given SH2 the green light because the benefit it will bring is huge.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about interconnection – 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected across the UK thanks to HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" encourage Scottish inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed track has the potential to bring immeasurable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain."
We are therefore enthusiastically working with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland and thus to bring benefits to everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British ministers, within the next year and on joint decision-making on the next steps.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 on its flights for storing hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 for hand luggage and USD 2 for coffee or soda, although in their announcement on Wednesday they said passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new baggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge USD 25 if the fee is paid in advance, and USD 100 if passengers with payment are waiting until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the hundred-dollar fee was intended to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to collect that fee," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second handed baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees and stuffed into hand luggage hidden in storage as much as they could, so that space was often lacking in that space.
Fees are one of the ways to teach passengers to take less things on board.
O'Malley said the point of this new fee is not to actually raise more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding space in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in a queue at Frontier’s gate can bring luggage for which they pay nothing, while the other passenger queues for the same luggage pays USD 100.
O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s new baggage fee will not be in effect until summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that the handling of luggage costs money, and passengers who request the service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see an additional baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to withdraw enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses.
However, most did not apply to carry-on baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost company, Allegiant Air, followed its example later.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungary's Wizz Air, says air transport adviser Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's carry-on baggage charge would bring US$50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former executive of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and marveled at what he saw at the gate when passengers were met with an unusual Spirit fee for hand luggage.
"Getting on a plane was the smoothest I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.
I expected to see a gnashing of teeth and a fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the boarding took place in a flash."
The Frontier also applies fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following Spirit’s example.
Frontier said passengers who get lemonade or juice could keep the entire can and the coffee would be replenished for free.
The water will continue to be given free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to impose beverage charges in 2008 but backed away from it seven months later after passenger complaints, and no other major airline imitated it.
Frontier's last move to charge for hand luggage if the passenger does not purchase a flight directly from that airline is its latest effort to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel retailers, such as Orbitz, from USD 10 to 25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines the incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than do so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, she began giving customers who bought through an internet travel agency, just half the miles under the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cropped the reward for flying miles to 25 percent of the miles from the trip.
So the journey with Frontier, a long 1000 miles purchased through an internet travel agency, means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and lose money.
According to financial results reported on Wednesday by corporate partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell 9 percent and transport capacity shrunk by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter
The company Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier by selling this airline.
We have studied 11 THOUSAND ADS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11,000 job advertisements, including 4,300 of which were published in the daily press and 6800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is thus becoming the most important medium for publishing job offers.
Even in 2005, when the survey was first conducted, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010), it held steady at about 60 percent.
According to the analysis, job advertisements reflect significantly on the current situation of the labour market.
An example is a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in a period of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25 900 advertisements were published in the same period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is focused on a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including workers, according to the author of the analysis Pavlína Št'astnová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different for both media.
On the Internet, the top spots have been taken by advertisements looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or small business leaders was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, the large representation belongs mainly to the service and workers' professions.
The most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through an advertising offer include, of course, education.
Other areas pursued included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was given in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only two percent of the advertisements, employers demanded an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in daily newspapers at 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Experience in the industry was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
The requirements for practice are generally associated with qualified professions.
These include, in particular, production managers and other executives.
The workers’ professions are mainly mechanics and repairers, or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical equipment, added the author of the study Jiří Tillner.
Employers also list in half of their advertisements the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential applicants.
Communication skills have long been found in first-place advertising as the most frequently required skills.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
A fifth of shopping centres are struggling with low traffic
This is according to data from real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Shopping Centre will be opened to the public in Bohnice, Prague, the 19th shopping centre in Prague.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
The disappointing performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large center towards the locality and bad layouts, i.e. too many floors or a complicated and confusing arrangement of passages, or dead places of centers," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle's head retail department, Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of shopping centres are struggling with low traffic.
The main reasons include, among other things. poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or market oversaturation in a given location.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centres need to try harder to 'entice' their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
The occupancy of shopping centres is generally stable, according to Soták, even rising at some centers, because landlords were willing to discount rents in crisis and lease some units.
"It is true, however, that some projects that are not fully booked have recently opened up and the average occupancy is thus reduced (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
Shopping centres open in the past two years have been pushing the market very slowly, according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a place in the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', focused on purchases and services of daily needs for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
Also, according to Soták, there is a place for other shopping centres on the domestic market.
Both for small 'service' centers and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or extensions in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, they see the space for the upcoming shopping centre on Vítězné náměstí, and according to him, they have a clear potential of Na Příkopě and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is developing intensively, which allows merchants to cover and expand to ever smaller cities at favorable rent and operating costs, there is also space in some local and residential shopping centers, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rentable areas.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a wrestled wrestling ghost in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found blinded in a straightened spirit behind the grandstands in the gymnasium of the high school he went to on January 11.
The sheriff's investigators from the Lowndes County district concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of the 17-year-old rejects it.
"They are unequivocally convinced that their son has been murdered," Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They are convinced that this is contrary to logic, to the laws of physics, and also to common sense," Crump said.
They believe it is to be covered up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back in a body bag," he said.
State Attorney General Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep track of the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is sufficient basis for a routine investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy suggested that Johnson had died as a result of "positional asphyxiation."
The second autopsy, however, according to Moore, cited a different cause of death.
"There are a few question marks that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers enough evidence in the Johnson death case for an order to investigate a crime or civil rights violation, he will ask the FBI and its execution.
A representative of the sheriff's office from the Lowndes district was not immediately available for any comment on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to make available all the videos from surveillance cameras that investigators had inspected.
The juvenile's parents hope the video footage will include a clue leading to the revelation of how their son died.
Report: Obama's campaign considered swapping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden on the 2012 nominee for Hillary Clinton.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine obtained a copy of the coming book and announced Thursday night that the president's top associates held intense group meetings and polls in late 2011 to estimate whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes of re-election.
According to the Times magazine's national-political correspondent, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely the former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect the move of former Secretary of State Clinton to the post of vice president would have on the election.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Just a few of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina and former White House chief advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was a representative of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make that move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate list would "not substantially increase Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've been researching a number of things intensively, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.
You mustn't forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we thought, "Christ, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "proper care," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had made considerable investments to determine whether that move in the election would pay off.
“In campaigns, this kind of money is not spent on elections and qualitative research, unless something is really seriously considered,” Martin said on AC360.
But it's unclear whether Obama knew his team was considering that exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about this potential shuffling of cards.
While Daley said he didn't think the president "was aware of the potential change," the former head of the office admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" does not definitively answer the question of whether the political probe has reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was unaware of research related to removing Biden from the candidate list.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
No, Mr. Hašek.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to put such pressure on Martin Hašek to be stripped of all political functions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will lower the level of political culture that is already slim.
Martin Hašek is shielded by the promise he has made, but everyone and the politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babiš also has a material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The best program championed by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he steps back in politics.
Mr. Hašek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me, if you have not just lied - here you see how complicated it is with lying), you will leave politics alone, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as the expression of the man who made the mistake and bears responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be believed.
You either want to be a proud, even wrong person, or a lifelong sketch.
It may seem unfair to you when I only address you, but you are the leader and they are just misguided sheep.
And you are the leader, and you have always wanted to be.
I understand that now you're trying to lower your ears for a while, regrouping your strength, sitting out the shame and then attacking again, but that's how partisans or cheaters behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes the leader, the alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
Black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying hard to find money to repair a crumbling highway network, many are starting to see a solution in a small black box that fits easily into your car’s dashboard.
The devices that track every kilometre a motorist travels and that transmit this information to the authorities are at the heart of Washington’s controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renovate an outdated system of financing U.S. major roads.
Usually the dull design of highways suddenly prompted intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these small lockers that would record the mileage and perhaps where you are going – and then this information would be used to draw up a tax assessment.
The tea party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to proceed, some states are not waiting for anything.
They are figuring out how they can move in the next decade to a system in which the driver pays per kilometre of the road he is driving on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter where we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to begin tracking the mileage for that state for every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this.
The suggestion is that the Tax-funded Road Trust Fund, which Americans pay at gas stations, is down.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by a single cent.
"Gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed tracking devices in 500 cars to test this system of paying per kilometre driven.
"In the long run, this seems like the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the mileage.
It is no surprise that urban liberals like this idea because taxes can be used to change driver behaviour patterns, which can help, for example, reduce traffic jams and greenhouse gas generation.
California planners look to this system in planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (a Pennsylvania representative), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free-market officials from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to the idea that drivers will pay for mileage.
"It's not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who urged Congress in 2011 to go in the direction of paying per kilometre.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a pilot project for US$90 million, which was supposed to involve about 10,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural lawmakers representing the components of the population, whose daily lives often mean traveling many kilometers for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The most ardent is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a tax on mileage, instead of a tax on gasoline.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is currently researching the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state Departments of Transportation, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement the change.
However, this concept does not have only proponents.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
"The concerns about Big Brother-type surveillance and similar matters have been a major concern," said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at Nevada's Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the test project went, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to record everyday trips and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among those few states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many miles the car will travel, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology has brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (the actual distance travelled).
The firm was not originally involved in the action to assist the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through in the emerging market with legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they drive.
But this device, which they try, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and delivers only a limited amount of information that is regularly uploaded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to go for it if you don’t track their speed and their location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do that.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the state's residents.
In other places, they hope that the prudent public will accept this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In the city of New York, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped so that extra charges can be paid for parking hours, provide mileage insurance, and collect speed data from other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city's projection document said.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all discussions about paying per kilometre are not just a huge proxy issue.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Committee in the San Francisco Bay area say Congress could very easily solve the problem of a bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the gas tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other cars that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for any radical operation when it is richly enough to take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Which billionaire are you going to talk to next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy the operator O2.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations and according to various sources from agencies and behind the scenes, the hand is already in the sleeve.
The announcement of the transaction is expected to come in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequency auction, before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
Under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications, it has embarked on an auction of frequencies for LTE networks.
And to the general surprise, until then the company's desire to penetrate telecommunications was not talked about.
But Sazka is now led by a very experienced telecommunications lubricant Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing boss of Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), later became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and last headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She applied for the auction and now she admits she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it gives logic.
If he succeeds in the auction, he will be able to move existing customers from his own virtual operator to his network.
Vodafone would probably not like it under normal circumstances, but according to the information of Hospodářské noviny, it can be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from the agreement of rival operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender on LTE networks (as a newcomer can auction a specially designated spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go to auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning only limited spectrum (there is not enough frequency for everyone).
Vodafone can share networks with Sazka.
Vodafone will release Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or the newly built 900 MHz LTE network), thus enabling the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building a costly LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the saved money on some fixed internet or cable TV provider.
And Kellner?
The purchase of the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is a Czech daughter) would immediately acquire a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big moloch that will be waiting for a restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would have acquired the LTE networks already for O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already declared that they will share the networks.
The auction could finally end in success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia over a protest against planned oil drilling in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported today by AFP, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
It also claims that the original accusations of its activists from piracy have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women, detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the oil rig in the Arctic, were transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA, it was a planned move.
Authorities initially accused the environmentalists of piracy, for which they faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But they announced last week that they would replace the charge with milder disorderly conduct, for which there is a risk of a lower sentence with a maximum of seven years in prison.
Greenpeace said in a statement that the accusations of piracy had not yet been dropped, as promised.
This means that the detainees are now charged with two offences.
The powerful Committee for Investigation announced last week that it would replace the allegations of piracy with allegations of disorderly conduct.
But when thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, a new one has been charged against everyone," Greenpeace was quoted as saying by the statement.
The Russians arrested three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement from 18 countries near Gazprom's oil rig in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, everyone has been held in custody, against which they have filed an appeal, but the court has dismissed them all.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of detention.
Greenpeace chief executive Kumi Naidoo said today that moving to St. Petersburg will make it easier for detainees to meet with both families and consular workers.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They may actually be worse," he pointed out.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked for help from King Willem-Alexandre of the Netherlands.
In a handwritten letter published today by the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper, the monarch called for talks about their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A cocaine addict who warned a mobster against a police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) was to give information to the King of the Underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared his drug addiction would come out.
A Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed a drug mobster of a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supposed to give sensitive information about the investigation into his drug-smuggling activities after becoming suspected of using cocaine, to underworld chief Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was hailed by criminals as the best legal representative, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he represented in previous narcotics proceedings.
Police spotted Sarborough (32) leaving three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just having dinner with his Law Society colleagues.
Based on the tests, in which traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he sought to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were followed at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police arrested heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million during a series of raids, another 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) passed information to criminals for fear of his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors, experienced shameful moments before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of defending the administration of justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
During an earlier hearing, he pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's downfall came after Scarborough was found to have been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house and spotted him placing 60 percent clean-up drugs under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough and Ditta, who were at a dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, were in regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home, where he found the drugs, and nine interviews were held between the two.
The court heard that traces of Class A drug were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, saying he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell into "confidential communication."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards from it, but all were withheld and his hair samples were taken.
During the police interrogation, he said he ran the office both at his home address and in the workplace, and that clients visited him at home because of work matters as well.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, it contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of which it had previously represented, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who else is more aware that they must not violate the law than the legal representative in the criminal field."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, it's a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were no doubt legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
He was obstructing the police investigation as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activity.
Mr. Ditta did not bring his reputation to his profession, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta declined the offense, saying: "If I were a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I would like to give Mr. Scarborough information, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
After the hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself from a criminal representative in the criminal law area when he began to obtain drugs from organized criminals."
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organized crime groups, which gave him the task of gathering valuable information about the police investigation.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and inspire confidence and the feeling of being able to rely on them in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Offences Unit in Lancashire has conducted an investigation against Mr. Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now for obstructing the administration of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring criminals to justice.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is out of the reach of the law.
We will find you and put you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of colluding for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in the trafficking were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug violations.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself in which he said his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death block in America, as a guest at dinner he would like Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for the work he cited inequality.
Obama retreats from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama yesterday backed away from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
Referring to hundreds of thousands of notices of testimony from Republican providers in recent days, Republicans have accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama has flinched since his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
With what he called a "commotion in the media" about the testimony, Obama called on the Americans who received those announcements to search for new insurance policies in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should come as no surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance on their own may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements given by the Affordable Care Act.
"I'm telling these Americans straight up: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her testimony before the Washington-based Energy and Trade Committee.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the Internet market has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
The irritated Sebelius spoke out this sentence, which was captured by the microphone on, yesterday towards the adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's committee meeting, which took place after a tumultuous exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a Missouri representative, which concerned whether she, too, had to engage in Obama's care program.
For more than three hours during the hearing, he repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance, and purchased a program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
It travels through the mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not many doctors in West African countries; just one per 5 000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 major candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year award contest, you can vote for him or any of the ten main candidates.
The winner will receive 250 000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and drive to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the capital, Cameroon Yaounde, in 1981.
At first, he was only treated with a broken arm, but subsequently developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he created a hematoma that had caused him problems all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals where he received the kind of treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There are many patients there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5 000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 residents.
And even if the doctors of Cameroon could visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health care spending is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Bwelle said.
With poverty, they can't enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffered, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor vascular surgeon at the central Yaounde hospital.
And he founded the nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas over the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, almost 32 000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are packed into deliveries, attached to the rooftops of medical supplies and travel through rough terrain to villages that need help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his broad smile and unbridled energy – is very willing to engage in local merriment.
The next day, the team begins to treat hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every quest," says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a 60-kilometer radius, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that is required by the school, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgeries are usually done in the school building, at City Hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make room for the next patient.
Using the light from the generator, the operating room and the hygiene equipment of Bwelle and his volunteers, they work until the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but the village musicians usually help the team not lose motivation.
"To stay up and keep working, they play the drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free operations last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to locals.
One man said he would be able to work again after the hernia surgery.
"That will change our family's future," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says it is this second work that finances about 60% of his nonprofit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteers for the Bwelle group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can do those campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, this is a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We thoroughly washed Dr. Bwell's hands and removed bloodstains or held his tools," O'Malley says.
As a second-year medical student in America, you will never experience that.
Students volunteers usually pay their way to Cameroon alone and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, food, transportation and study are provided by Bwelle.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, constant harness is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier, fulfilling the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," Bwelle says.
And I think about my father.
I hope he can see what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain – that’s why I do it.

Central banks will keep swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the U.S. Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks said in their joint statement.
"This is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at London-based bank Barclays.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not, in my opinion, any surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began to emerge in 2007 when the international credit market first stumbled.
The central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central banker's decision comes at a time when the U.S. Fed is preparing to end its U.S. economic support program, which could drive the price of money in the global market even higher.
The swap contract is used by default to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency while the liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as an imposition of one currency and a borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to return confidence in European banks.
EU agrees on banking oversight, ECB oversees 150 banks
The number of people infected with HIV has exceeded a thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of people infected is growing every year.
In 2002, for example, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121, and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and it was a record number.
"I don't think there is any doubt about the fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, from January to September, there were 165 HIV patients in the country, this year there were 176.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
There were 206 infected people in the Central Bohemian Region.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian and 116 from Ústí nad Labem.
The least infected came from the Highlands, there were 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients became infected during sex.
Fourteen people have become infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, since the beginning of testing, more than a quarter of a century, such a case has not occurred in the Czech Republic.
Six children were also born with HIV, transferred to them from their mother.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” says the author.
Stories of Thor can show that “rude power cannot equal clever cunning,” while Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would “be too wild, too scandalous for teaching at school, and in some cases too obscene,” said Crossley-Holland, who intercedes for careful selection of works appropriate to age.
“I think it’s great that myths and folk creation are already part of education,” he said.
I have been defending this plan for twenty years.
He added that "openly instructive" authors and teachers are a "subliminal" message for children with an engaging story like a "switch."
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Story, says: "You may have good intentions, but you'll do better to keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end with a happy end, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; exposed through the story, not openly established.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
Miloslava Cejpková: November Smile
It came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, who are not used to them yet.
First she put down her smile, the one she kept showing as a defense against the would-be friendly surroundings.
That made her feel better, because it was a mask she decided not to put off in public.
He was honest at home only in the days when she was a grandmother and had grandchildren Elinka or Adík around her.
And, of course, when her sons were on the phone.
She remembered very well the principle of endless courses of business skills.
Now they've finally really come in handy.
So she doesn't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a disguise on a masquerade.
November, or any other month, can't do that miracle to smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one that's not here for almost three years.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make the Cartier style evolve like a living language

GM is withdrawing some new light trucks in the U.S. for repairing the seat backrests
According to Friday's announcement from the U.S. auto safety authority, General Motors is pulling down nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to repair a defect with manual tilting of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the front seat tilt mechanism may have a fault.
As a result, the seat backrests do not comply with federal auto safety standards for headrests.
The notice, located on the website of the State Administration of Transport on the Road (NHTSA), says that “if the car gets hit from behind, the headrest may not properly protect the passenger, which increases the risk of injury.”
The downloaded models were made between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the shipment in June, and for this leading U.S. automaker, it is the most important vehicle launch since restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the delivery owner of the fault in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the announcement to owners because of the government's 16-day malfunction, which weakened car sales growth in October.
Silverado and Sierra delivery sales, which were redesigned for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to USD 37.47.
Too inquisitive newspapers are to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page asked for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the administrator told the press.
The New Express newspaper, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said the New Express newspaper would now make a "full remedy."
The regulation for "rectification" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in the province of Guangdong.
A preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, New Express newspapers from the Yangcheng group Evening News released several false reports about the aforementioned Zoomlion.
"The New Express newspaper's management has been disorderly," the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to "save Chen Yongzhou's administrative punishment in the form of the abolition of the journalist's license."
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Group of Evening News to make a complete correction to the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in the New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express newspaper.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express regarding financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspapers issued two requests for his release on the front page, claiming he was behind his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and confessed to giving false stories for a fee.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media industry and its ability to gain the trust of the public," he told state news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was craving money and fame.
I realize I acted wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express newspaper issued a front-page apology in which he stated that he had failed when he failed to adequately control his reports.
Recently, several closely watched suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of the change in the law from this year, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
With the growing misery of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are experiencing a flourish
At a pawnshop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter tuition fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money on it," says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives 2400 dollars (3000 SGDs) each month as an administrator, and her husband also works, family monthly income is inadequate, she says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is that ValueMax, where a woman conducts her transaction, became the third pawnbrower on the list on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore routinely apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring verification of a person (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And that's why, as families feel pressure over rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans backed by a loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of household credit primarily because of rising rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia due to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of the rankings with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also feared a high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week just so came out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from medium to low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically, high gold prices have contributed to people hastily stopping their personal property over the past two years and taking the opportunity to exchange their family jewellery for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city pawnshops make up gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
The largest pawnshop operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen up to 20 percent increases in recent months in the number of customers using its pawnshops.
The growth in the pawn industry is so large that ValueMax, a branch operator in downtown Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four offices – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax Executive Director Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund it by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it acquired this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it also doesn't directly increase debt.
"Customers stop items they already own, and the monetization of personal property does not increase the household's debt," he says.
In the company, the pledge of property is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, among those who use pawnshops, it is not just people in financial distress.
The wealthy people of Singapore also use the ValueMax branch when they stop gold rods or Rolex watches, and can thus get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from all possible circumstances.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow for the short term because of their bold business or investment, or small businesses that need help resolving problems in their cash flow," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
For the crash of the website, the NSA does not blame hackers, but "internal error"
The mysterious National Security Agency said last Friday that its website fell for several hours last week because of an internal error, not because of a hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov website was not accessible for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be fixed during tonight.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS attack (distributed denial of service) is not true.
Previously, this evening, online server sensors recorded that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's internal sensitive networks were not "at all" compromised.
A spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed that it was responsible for decommissioning the NSA's site through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers overload and the page crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, which once earned the nickname No Such Agency, has in recent months become the focus of public attention after a string of revelations by foreign and domestic surveillance programs, and a biting critic of the NSA's stolen intelligence files from the agency and their disclosure by a disillusioned former employee, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency was prompted by earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the monitoring in 1986 to the end of this year's third quarter, the tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, there have been 2 063 infected in the Czech Republic so far.
In 396, immune failure disease has already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of people infected in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, and five years later there were 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new infections and in 2010 180.
Last year, the number dropped to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"I do not think there is any doubt about the fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavaty said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS outbreak in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the brink of power
It is almost a rule that at key moments the country was not the head of state in such a form that it could fulfill its state duties.
If he was T. Masaryk physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidency and the events around Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We probably wouldn't have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly beyond the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight laboriously for its legitimacy.
And most importantly, the nation would not have a hangover to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and he was still in shape during Munich, but during the war it started to go downhill with him and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
To be a little better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
A shame to talk about Hach.
They elected him, saying that "the President will not get into a situation that he would make decisions."
But he had to, although the big decision-making thing about the knife on Hitler's neck in the chancellery probably wasn't.
Until the last days of March 1939, František Moravec, the intelligence chief, said what should be done to ensure that the occupation, which he knew exactly about for a day, did not take place so smoothly and with such profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, on the other hand, they didn't believe him, on the other hand, they were afraid.
The human wreckage of Gottwald had his age-old comrades executed, as Moscow had instructed him.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitely prevented by his share of normalization and had to dethrone him, already completely senile.
That Husák was a helpless and sick depressed old man made the events easier in November 89, but that is the only positive.
Havel was lucky that he had not been met in office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his achievements suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks like what he looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the republic.
Or maybe it's in danger, it's just not visible.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is not (from a historical point of view) good that the president is not entirely at strength.
It is not a normal state.
Couldn't we just elect someone who's admissibly thinking and acceptable healthy in this country again?

Schwarzenberg: We have early elections here in two years
TOP 09 Chairman Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election.
A week after the last ones in an interview with Aktuálně.cz, he said that there is no other way out, and every government arising from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blinder.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, saying he estimated the lifespan of the beginning of the parliamentary term within two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly choose in a completely different way next time, he disagrees: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the chairman of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as this year (compared to 2010 it lost about 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that there would be early elections, it would strengthen Andrej Babiš's ANO 2011 movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the party leadership, declared that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in charge of the Social Democracy, Schwarzenberg commented in his own way:
"The leaders of the Democratic Party as little boys go to the head of state to allow them to coup in the party."
"I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I've never seen something so eagerly executed in my life," the TOP 09 chairman added.
And towards President Zeman (whom he clashed in the fight for the presidency) he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to seize that party."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the Chamber of Deputies, including the Farsky Register of Contracts, which were discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the chairman of TOP 09 argues that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement, Martin Komárek, accused TOP 09 of having the idea of introducing a register of contracts "robbing" the ANO movement's program.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply dusted off a proposal that was already under second reading.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check the tip
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used methods of “hitting the phone, tracking and confronting” to confirm the fraudulent tip for a love affair involving then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney General Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey that the News of the World had captured fake news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and penetrate her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson also called her and left her with voicemails.
"The prosecutor suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the person standing in front of the house hoping to catch people outside, but a person who likes to tell people stories to see what they have to say," Mr. Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways of exploring stories: hacking into the phone, tracking and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He clearly knows about the other one, surveillance, he has to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "Of course he knows."
The rumours of the love relationship Clarke is involved were first captured by the NotW newspaper's reporting department when the source, who was sexually interested in Ms. Pawlby, was told: "You're just wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private investigator's computer, where Ms Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects."
During the time Ms Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief correspondent Neville Thurlbeck and former correspondent James Weatherup oversaw Ms Pawlby's tracking of the movement.
Coulson eats 18. He left a voicemail in June 2005 in which he told her: "I got a story that we are going to publish tomorrow and which I would like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story was, according to the same model as other prominent figures, which include former Interior Secretary David Blunkett.
It was heard in court on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman while he himself saw himself with co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with other people in order to hack into phones in the period from 3. October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have confessed to crashing into the phone.
Ben Greenman: The 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is the place where solo comic performances were born in America: almost a century ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes to the assembled people using the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York festival of comedy.
Founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in both small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles have appeared in Carolines and have become successful to the point where they are too big to be played at the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes a performance by Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year’s festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller radio and television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has risen with his sitcom (a cheerfully spicy "League" on a fantastic-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation" program, but she became most famous for her fast-spreading series of "Marcel the shells with shoes on".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, sneering, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), is a product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg will speak to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he held a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting takes place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he walks down the aisle between two buildings sometimes, and he's like, man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, while the chairman of Štěch stirred up discord.
Governor Chovanec was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the bureau, and he confirmed it.
Chairman Sobotka has always been, and continues to be a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and legible and useless, Vice-President Zaorálek has made it impossible to interview most on television.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better option than for the ČSSD to propose the Vice-President of the Senate, Gajdůšková, who would not have an initial handicap and I think she would do a standard performance.
That's such a good solution that hardly anyone in the leadership will support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdůšková could without fear form a minority government with a mere blessing from Chairman Babiš and without the People's Party, but with the People's Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a religious Social Democrat.
This mini-minority government would have great stability because it would enforce a proper referendum law and pledge to support even the chairman of Dawn, Okamura.
President Babiš would eventually accept the progression of taxes, because he is bright and will see that it is not possible without it.
The People's People would not bring trouble, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and otherwise they would not be in government.
The same is true of YES, even here a valuable minister would be found, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but will provide support, also well.
Let's give courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
Barta's detention is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is he behind the leak of wiretaps?
The president of the Public Affairs, Vít Bárta, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Along with him, the head of the Department of Anti-Corruption Police, Jan Petržílek, was also detained.
The detention is related to the wiretapping of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the wiretaps, which was received by the news server Novinky.cz, was confirmed by a trusted source to the Czech Press Office.
The wiretapped phone calls of Janoušek and Bém, published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes and in which the two men address each other's "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík", show Janoušek's influence on the steps of the city under Bém's leadership.
The newspaper said at the time that it was acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, from which it escaped to the ABL security agency two years later.
He owned Bart at the time.
News server Novinky.cz reported that the detained criminal Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with wiretaps, at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravský from the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
He and Vít Bárta also arrested an anti-corruption police officer
Bárta's lawyer Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV MPs, also did not want to comment on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but due to the protection of classified facts, I can no longer comment on this."
According to information Rights, the case is handled by the General Inspection of the Security Forces (GIBS).
News server tn.cz reported that Bárta could have bought classified information from the police.
According to the news server prvnizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the post of Bart allegedly sought.
However, the latest information of the Law shows that the detention of Vít Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.
Eva Kropáčová, a spokeswoman for the police presidium, declined to comment on the matter, saying the case was being dealt with by the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokeswoman for the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague, told Právo on Friday.
It is precisely the local prosecutor that supervises Bárta’s case, and it is therefore indirectly apparent from her that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted in the secrecy regime.
The reporter of the News managed to reach the wife of Vít Bárta Kateřina Klasnová in the morning before their residence in Prague’s Klárov.
She was just loading her suitcases into the car and leaving.
She declined to comment on the event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement, Tomio Okamura, commented on Bárta's detention.
He said he had no idea what was going on in the case.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate, and as I have repeatedly said before the election, he was not or is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy, Tomio Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who ran unsuccessfully for the Dawn of Direct Democracy movement of Tomio Okamura in the past early elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case of bribery of MPs of Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months with a 30-month reprieve.
Afterwards, the verdict was changed and Barta was acquitted.
Concerns over Mozambique security are escalating because of a conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founder's Mozambican president, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to proclaim peace slogans for a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive officer of the investment company.
Out of fear for her country's future, she swapped corporate clothing for a T-shirt adorned with the inscription "we demand safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, there have been near daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, about some of the worst skirmishes since the peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once the infamous rebel movement, originally backed by the white government in Rhodesia and then the government of apartheid in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that open conflict will break out in the country again, but recent events have started foreign investors and locals.
The fast-growing economy is at stake, as discoveries of large-scale offshore oil and coal deposits in the northwest may bring more than $50bn worth of investment from companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and U.S.-based Anadarko over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo have accused each other of tensions.
The Renamo party says the government has sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in Sofala province, the traditional Bastion of the Renamo Party, on September 17.
The violent assault of the former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for the Renamo party, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the conflict because it is said to have been attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to ease fears of instability.
Mr. Guebuza told French press office AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever of his strength remained to try to prove that he could order the government to make his own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo claim to want to avoid war.
But fears grew when Mr Mazanga's words were quoted that the Renamo party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the deal.
"Our goal is to get back to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr. Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease tensions between those parties, stirred up by a series of skirmishes this year.
It's a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which sought electoral changes, has already said it would boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort by the dying movement to gain benefits and financial proceeds from the government.
The Renamo party's electoral stake has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in the election.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza - whose second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a more party democratic system, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but has carried out divisive terrorist attacks on police stations and on vehicles on a key road between north and south.
Most of the skirmishes occurred in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers away from the capital, Maputo, but where the city of Beira, the port on which the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on, is in its export of coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when the Renamo party threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is solely borne by the government and the president, and that he is supposed to be the one who finds a solution to the problems.”
Protester Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee on the Oversight of Corruption.
Joe Tripodi, the former New South Wales secretary, has denied changing the policy of coastal rental at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled property.
The Independent Committee Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its search to see if Mr. Obeid had lobbied with several state ministers to have a lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without having to take part in the selection process after his expiration in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interests in those properties, based on evidence presented on Thursday by Mr Tripodi's former deputy head of the office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to go to public tenders.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term terms and conditions.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought US$2.5 million a year to the Obeids, were renewed without the need to participate in a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, urged a shift in government rental policy.
The transcript of the calls submitted in the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the ports department after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
"Was the subject of conversations during these phone calls the development of the policy of commercial leases?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.

The dog summed up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on a bed, and went to the chateau in Lány.
What health is he in?
In Kunovice, the cabbage bubbles, they don't add chemistry to it
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut want to produce in the coming months in Slovácká Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October and will last for about half a year.
Since 1925, he has been producing a healthy delicacy here in the traditional way, i.e. by pedaling directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, it is a rarity.
Our employees are walking a nearly ten-kilometre route per shift.
Each of the ten tanks can fit fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, the filling of one takes three shifts," said David Kladroba, director of the Slovácká Fruta plant.
The cabbage heads are transported to the company’s premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclav.
Fruta employees then clean the vegetables, remove the broomsticks and throw in the grit.
From there, the already sliced cabbage falls into swimming pools of six-meter depth, in which pedals dressed in white clothing and boots work tirelessly.
This displaces unwanted air.
The last layer of cabbage is covered with a tarp and loaded with water.
"The cabbage ring then matures for six to eight weeks with spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation-promoting substances," said Director Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, the individual layers of the workers are sprinkled with salt and cumin.
The cabbage after fermentation travels to the filling line.
It is packed in sweet-sour brine in bags or glasses and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut primarily to the domestic and Slovak markets.
It is also interested in it in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Damks are said to be banned by UEFA from posting sentences for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the judges' committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing sentences for the judges.
It is prohibited by the rules of UEFA, which she said in an interview with the daily Právo.
Otherwise, the FACR would be threatened with punishment.
Damková also refused to side with the footballers of Pilsen, where she came from.
This speculation is really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example, also from Prague.
So in the case of voting, I can lose 1:6," Damková said in response to the criticism, which broke down after Pilsen recently played twice as many penalties than other league teams.
Although the FACR has stopped posting sentences for referees in recent months, Damková assures that the judges are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the committee finds out that the referee made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, whatever match it is," Damkova said.
The reason the sentences are not being published is, according to Damka, a ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and severely punishes violations."
"We're very suspicious of us, and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
"We have made the limits public, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop with this, there will be harsh sanctions," Damkova said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If the disclosures continue, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program of the judges' education," Damkova added.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its estimate of annual profit and expects record gains from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual pre-tax profit to range between US$325 and US$340 million versus US$305 million to US$315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase against a record profit of US$290.4 million from 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre made an eight percent gain in the first half and began a sharp rise primarily in Australian and British travel outside business trips.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards a record annual profit before interest and tax," he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
Business with recreational activities has recovered during the second half of Australia, offsetting the slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreation area, while corporate clients spent less.
The U.S. trade has recovered after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to bring full-year profit for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at USD 38.20.
British police deliver extradition notice to Assange
British police today delivered a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said he had delivered a "release notice" to the 40-year-old Australian, saying he was asking him to come to the police station and that if he failed to do so, he could be threatened with arrest.
Assange has exhausted his options under the UK law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition this month, and is facing extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges.
Because he feared Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he sought out 19. June refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has applied for asylum from the South American country.
Scotland Yard "delivered a notice of extradition to a 40-year-old man asking to come to the police station at the day and hour that was addressed to him," the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the release notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face espionage charges because he has published 250 000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
Supreme Court rules: Untimely can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can also be prosecuted for possible offences he may have committed before the August dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Mark Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, on the contrary, he decided that they could not be punished for possible offences until they gave up their parliamentary mandates last November, said Petr Knötig, a spokesman for the Supreme Court.
The court rejected the motion of the prosecutor Ivo Ištvan, who wanted to continue criminal proceedings with MPs.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for giving up the mandate and not causing problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to continue to prosecute the former prime minister who offered them these posts.
Aircraft manufacturers argue over seat width, big orders at stake
There was a dispute among the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the second-class seats on long-haul flights, which this month gave rise to a bitter exchange of views on a Dubai air show.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for economy class – not exactly the one that airlines would usually have to avoid, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency requirements of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but chief U.S. rival Boeing says airlines are supposed to decide on that.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sale of the largest version of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21.
The way in which the rear of the aircraft is distributed – especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis of the economic performance requirements for the design of the new "mini-jumbo" aircraft.
Boeing says the improved "777X" will deliver 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says the rival version of its A350 will deliver 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out over 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus now appeals directly to the public ahead of the Dubai air show, where the 777X is expected to gain a predominance with more than 100 orders.
He recently showed what might be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture showing three people crowded in a restaurant with the headline "Would you like it?"
"Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in narrower seats than those in regional turboprop aircraft," said John Leahy, head of sales at Airbus.
As the eating swagger changes, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
From the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, by the turn of the century, according to U.S. Department of Health, the weight of the average American between the ages of 40 and 49 had increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims its rival sticks to the 50's seat concept, when the average width of the seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research suggesting that extending the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus's seat dimensions, saying it is not within the authority of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things they believe they need to do to be successful," said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
There is more space for passengers to elbow, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect yields.
Behind this dispute is a plant in ordering aircraft with estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least 700 billion dollars in catalogue prices, enough to deflect the weights of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent better efficiency for their latest designs of twin-engine long-haul aircraft than market leaders in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
Boeing's performance demands depend in part on the comparison of the 777X's design with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
“The reason Boeing does this is to pack more seats and make your planes more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“A forty-five-inch-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from Airbus’ business perspective, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777 model,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose.
Traveled aircraft dealers even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive arrangement.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a high-density layout for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cabin modifications by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call to new industry standards will remain unheard, but may deter the 777X sales wave.
CME will target the TV business.
It will release nearly a quarter of people.
The CME media group will be dismissed.
He wants to slim down a thousand people by the end of the year.
Osekat intends to all the side activities and only wants to focus on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4 500 people.
Nearly a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates televisions in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
The CME includes CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech versions of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what it will mean for the domestic TV number one TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really can't comment on it," said Josef Koukolíček, Nova's communications director.
According to MF DNES, significant redundancies will certainly not be avoided by the Czech Republic, but this should have by far the greatest impact on the staffing status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new Nova bosses Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined after longtime director Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to the TV business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents of the defunct Nortel company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers including Google, a company it over-coited at auction as part of Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel's patents for US$4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. Circuit Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps connect terms searched on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that operate on Google Android's operating system, which competes heavily with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made a US$900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to US$4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the fight for patents, Google received 12.5 billion dollars from Motorola Mobility, a deal motivated in part by Motorola’s patent group.
“Despite the failure to obtain patents that are the subject of the dispute, Google infringed and continues to infringe the patents,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it says Google is in breach of the patent intentionally, as the lawsuit claims.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story of independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for the membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This led the cause to stories of passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along the Hadrian's wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this was not reflected in the headlines of the newspaper.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if that suits them.
Given that Scotland is not in Schengen now, the offer of continued mismatch would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And so old that he's become an excavation. I heard the journalist duck that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
Still, there is an interesting idea in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade the London chomout for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is the true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
Due to the euro crisis, the so-called Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, the influence of the party dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – came out of nowhere and already in the September federal elections captured almost five million votes, essentially “sweeping out” of the Bundestag the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
On home soil, there has always been resistance to a plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has become a defining moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the straitjacket strung to national economies through clinging to the common currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments managing a high budget deficit – this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members at exchange rates favorable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in the area of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenues and public spending – which Germany encourages.
The current problems with the budget and currency are due to the deeper cause of European malaise.
As a result of the “green” energy policy backed by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies at the cost of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gasoline than is the case in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the cost area, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the wage freezes in the world would not avert the slamming of the European petrochemical industry by cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering revolt, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that will keep Germany at bay and allow Paris to stand in the world to the level of Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a political legitimacy card and has enforced its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
The front is now with 24% of the vote the most popular party in France - an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that the splitting of the right will automatically have a positive effect on the left.
How does Le Pen handle her newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc operating against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in its history.
In doing so, it occurs to me that in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will come together and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but rather transform into something looser in the sense of “Europe (sovereign) peoples”, which General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and cling to the United States.
However, Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of announcing to Berlin and Brussels when to let us be.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a relaxed order of Europe, provided it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful political movement not to enforce austerity measures in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition stance against the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only to adopt the austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Parents of intersex children may choose "indeterminate gender"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize the third gender in children born with an ambiguous genital system.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified only as male or female.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any gender for such children, and allows them to list genders as “indeterminate” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pushing for parents to make a hasty decision on their child for sex determination surgery, and to combat discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years: "I am neither male nor female."
I will remain a cloak created by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year of 2000 children are born one, which is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of gender development disorders, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
The intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
The determination of gender is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and determine it instead of waiting and following the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determining issues, said the new German law "looks like a good thing."
Intersex children are ethical dilemmas.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but for most children, that's not the case," he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery, and then it can wait to see how the identity develops.
Knowing how a child develops a sexual affiliation is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report, submitted to the European Committee in 2011, described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically composed of both and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and figure, in the primary sexual characteristics, such as the reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of discrimination experienced by intersex and transsexual people in the work area, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys not matching any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowed to mark male, female or "third gender" in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first globally recognised "sexless" person in June when she won a court appeal to retain the status of "indefinite" gender for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, in addition to M (man) and F (woman), German passports will also have a third designation, X, for intersex persons.
In neighbouring France, according to a news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic online also defined itself against the German law and wrote: "With the way the world is drawn to a new state, when gender is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we turn two other pillars of civilization upside down."
One mother of a newborn from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see the children be assigned gender at birth.
“Parenting alone is stressful without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your child,” she told the website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sexes were called hermaphrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had a dual sex.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought gender was something like a blackboard that could be erased and redrawn again.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, saying that sexual affiliation is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes make the decision incorrectly because they do not know how children will feel about their gender when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
A persistent theory about how to treat children with an ambiguous sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender was malleable.
He created the new concept of "sexual affiliation" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment - as parents raised their child - affected childhood genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether it was identified as male or female.
But in one case from 1966, known as "John/Joan," his theory became questionable.
The parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged due to poor circumcision, was advised to have their child completely castrated, remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he was transferred back to the boy and married a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors are using this model to this day.
But in the 90's, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared "dissatisfied with the outcome."
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous genital tract.
Doctors were unsure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfactory life."
And so, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
At 12, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask about it.
At 18 he was sent for vaginal surgery.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
I was sterilized after birth and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD) that prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its genitals.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, taking testosterone doses, and had his breasts removed,
The operations caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice, based in California, fears that German law "calls for labeling and stigmata."
“Many activists fear that German law will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose ‘indeterminate’ for the child.”
We're afraid it'll encourage intervention.
We believe it is better to assign male or female gender and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will eventually sound, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because it "allows adults to be included in the third gender."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid gender," she said.
The German law is about to be allocated at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not wage at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh chest radiologist who has a daughter with a gender disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law will "award powers" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgen numbness syndrome.
Because its androgen receptors are defective, Katie developed female features.
He has a vagina, but he doesn't have a uterus and ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and, as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania, she works as an intern at a child psychiatry.
Although infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some space not to rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to run certain tests and think about it and give them time to write “man” or “woman.”
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise your child and love him.
You have an amazing child and you rejoice in it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"It brings the possibility of involving a child in decision-making and taking away the anxiety that binds parents because they don't have the certainty that they're doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child decides which gender he identifies with more – and that’s a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The bird was airlifted from a drilling rig in the North Sea and launched back into nature
The bird was brought to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and launched back into the wild.
One rattler was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after it had previously been treated by Scottish company SPCA at a rescue centre until it recovered.
Operating centres Colin Seddon said: "This rattle probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught over the North Sea by strong winds."
Apparently, he ran out of strength and found refuge on an oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us with a request for help."
By the time the rattle was drained, he was in good shape and healthy.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who will carry out a lawn renovation.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the norms for the first football league.
Karel Drábek: Coal Hill - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The Coal Hill is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Together with several others, the evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník region at a time (from a geological point of view) is recent.
The last eruptions here were still at the beginning of the Quaternary.
When viewed from a greater distance, the Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built between 1755 and 1765, is strikingly plastered on the top of Uhlířský vrch.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn, which was standing next to the church, did not survive.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley from four lines of lip was planted, about 1 km long.
The Way of the Cross on Uhlířský vrch is the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 it lasted only until 2004.
On fifteen stops are wooden sculptures made by the local art carver František Nedomlel.
He used various species of trees from the Low Jeseník region.
Similarly, the pedestals from the rocks from the local area form an interesting geological exhibition.
The name of the sponsor is also indicated at each stop.
The Coal Hill is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric measurements of age differ somewhat, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than Velký Roudný (age 3.3 million years) and older than Venus volcano (age 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born by explosion.
In doing so, she ejected a significant amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the bedrock, which by burning obtained a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this phase, lava leaked to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption ejected red, brown-red and sometimes even black tuffs.
Their layer is up to 50 meters thick and its part is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the tufs, the striking volcanic bombs are up to 1 meter large. The second eruption also ended with a lava outburst.
At the end of the activity, lava leaked out of the volcano, which today forms up to 50 m a powerful layer of slag basalt.
Volcanoes that alternate with the ejection of volcanic ash with lava discharges are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they were given the name stratovolkans.
The original volcanic cone was gradually erosion.
However, it was threatened by the mining of rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here between 1953 and 1962.
The tuffs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The mining was stopped under pressure from experts and the public and thus preserved this unique place.
However, the problem is in the porosity and small cohesion of the rocks, which quickly weather, break down and slide down the slope.
The quarry disappears so quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
Uhlířský vrch can be reached by following the green tourist sign from Bruntál or from Slezský Kočov.
Automobilists can use a free parking lot at the beginning of the linden alley, where a short nature trail begins.
The drunk poured gasoline on the whole house: He threatened to burn it down with his own family!
The tension increased, the fear escalated.
The man began to threaten to burn down the whole house.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the vicinity went to the scene, as did a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire department.
A police negotiator arrived on the scene, trying to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to burn down the house.
The house had to be entered by an intervention unit, which defused and handcuffed the man.
The aggressor then ended up for examination in a hospital in Mladá Boleslav, from where he was taken to an anti-alcohol detention station.
Firefighters eventually buried the house with petrol with a sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to people, all pets were also rescued from the house.
The man did not give to the police negotiator, so the commandos followed him.
Anger over a sentence handed down over a plotter of a bomb attack in Bali
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the sentence handed down over the last of the plotters who were brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should have been executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted individuals in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for putting together explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people remained dead, including 88 Australians, and many wounded.
He was also found guilty on several other counts of terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, even though it could have insisted that a man nicknamed "Demolition man" (the crasher) was given the death penalty thanks to his reputation as an explosives expert.
The decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other screwers nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP, Ms. Corteen said, "He should be put in front of a firing squad."
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't see more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari club was leveled when it was 12. October 2002 shortly after 23 o'clock, a strong bomb placed in an outdoor parked van was detonated.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, he "died" three times to doctors.
Mr Hughes said Pateka should meet the same fate as the three other members of the Jama Islamiya terrorist cell responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... There's just no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others is not that much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He avoided arrest for nearly a decade, but was eventually caught in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later U.S. forces killed former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reestablish links between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt regret for how much grief he has caused to others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis 22. February will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time.
The Cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope, and are the ones who elect the Pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help select his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – the group thus shrinks to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the ceremonial promotion of the new cardinals, a gathering of current cardinals known as the constorium will be held.
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene a February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices newspaper said the number of electing cardinals is likely to fall by February.
He said the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needs to be to raise the number of electors again to 120, and as many cardinals exceeding the age of 80 as he wants.
The consistor next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, to whom he has given the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that the Pope would ask these cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s a complete novelty.
Valero said the popes have traditionally elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he appoints.”
Announced series of racing Land Rovers
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as intercommunication equipment.
Improved brakes, a service package to access Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and storage of the vehicle between plants are available.
Drew Bowler, Chief Technology Officer of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The race participants coming to the Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also a reachable path to world-class racing.
We are pleased to offer this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the different racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and to prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in the north of Africa and the Middle East.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week's Strings of Autumn
The saxophone great and jazz scene legend Wayne Shorter will make a dot next Wednesday for the 18th edition of the Strings of Autumn festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6 in the Great Hall of Lucerna together with his quartet consisting of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's arrangements for the symphony orchestra will feature Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which proves that the Prague concert on Strings of Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he has collaborated with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and a Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom they gave the direction of the new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
He has been performing with the Wayne Shorter Quartet for the past thirteen years.
A kind of afterparty after the festival will still be the club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin will introduce themselves to the domestic audience with their jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz band Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
U.S. commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf.
The Israelis have demonstrated exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, they sent out planes, hit the target and returned.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of confused and big-mouthed, actions unsupported by Obama's Syrian policies.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not be fooled by the media's claims that a "Syrian base" or "supplies for Hezbollah" was bombed.
I recently wrote about the fact that while the assistance of the U.S. to secular rebels in the country remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia cheerfully continues to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles unloaded in the port of Latakiya that became the target of an Israeli airstrike.
A clear message.
And note, Israel has once again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although according to popular Internet theories, it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government has honored 2 members of the spacial forces, probably the Delta Force.
It was not yet apparent that they distinguished themselves during the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Bengazia.
The heroic death of two former SEALs members who defended the CIA campus in the city is known, and I think it was members of a secret CIA commando made up of former soldiers.
There has long been speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in a elsewhere located CIA residence.
It's clearer now.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its machine-gun nest-protected offices in Libya (just on one such both members of the SEALs perished after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of an American commando in Tripoli, and as soon as they got word of an attack in Bengazi, they volunteered to intervene and, along with five private contractors, shot their way to the CIA compound in Bengazi.
The Obama administration is blamed by the fact that during that attack the commando was not officially deployed and completely, and that it was simply hesitant to do.
The commando commander, so without orders, will probably release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that the country operates not one-off, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And this is because until recently nothing officially confessed such a thing, and even now there is only talk of a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the U.S., although half-heartedly, is trying to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although to resolve the national situation, it would take much greater help.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised the Iranian air force for prosecuting U.S. drones.
Little is known, however, how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in the airspace, there is nothing to be done about it.
But if a drone is discovered by the Iranians in an international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom aircraft pursued an American drone in international space over the sea, when perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history occurred.
He flew under the Phantom to visually verify his armament without Phantom registering him on the radar or simply noticing him, and then when he suddenly appeared at his place and challenged the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without murmuring.
No wonder when the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare to Raptor.
The court blocked regulations regarding the procedure of stopping and searching persons by NY police departments
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked court orders demanding changes to the stoppage program and searching people at the New York Police Department and dismissing the judge from the case.
A second U.S. appeals federal court said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the decision on the appeal the city filed.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city challenged its conclusions and its corrective regulations, including the decision to assign supervision to help the police department change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The appeals court heard the arguments for the required postponement on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said the judge must be dismissed from the case because she came into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges, by saying that, as a judge, she did not act as a requirement to avoid appearing to be biased, partly because of a series of media interviews and public statements to which she openly responded to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officials violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search people.
It established independent supervision to oversee major changes including reforms in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some areas where the most frequent stopping of people is taking place.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases were denied after a police search.
The oral justification for the city's appeal is scheduled sometime after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there has been a halt and search of people for about a number of decades, but recorded tours under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are among the minorities, drafted a lawsuit that became a case of a class action.
Proponents of changes to the stopping and search program conducted by NY's police department say changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how other police departments use those procedures.
Opponents say the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that this will waste money, but will not solve a broader problem where the police force is under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand people in the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching for persons who are constitutional but reformed the way the NY Police Department's searches were put in place.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of directives to help in the case of children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the U.S. government, due to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines include information for schools on how to inform the teaching staff and staff about children's food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline available – most often used the EpiPen automatic injector – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislators recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms appearing in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
A child can say, “It’s like someone injecting me in my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue” or “Itchy tongue.”
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
However, I did not finish it, because there was someone at the branch who could not complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration fell through, then I moved and thanks to that, my address and ID number changed.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that I can’t because I have a different OP number, address and that I just can’t complete it and that I should ask for data deletion and make a new registration.
So I did this and on 24.10.2013 I wrote to technical support that I am asking for the deletion of all my personal data from the database according to the applicable data protection law.
On this, a vidental day wrote me technical support that I should complete the registration at the branch.
Thus began a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where they finally wrote after the 4th urgation 25.10. that they deleted the personal data at my request.
So you would think that he could make a new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not personal data, but eventually they also eliminated this).
So I used a different username and it jumped out to me that my personal data already had stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
When asked how this was possible, they wrote me back that they had actually deleted the personal data on 25.10. and to send an email with that error.
I did this (around 15 o’clock yesterday) and they wrote me back today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that therefore it is not possible, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I have been contacting technical support for a week and dealing with them that it is still not possible.
And what if what he claims (like he is not) could not register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way in those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fake email and phone number and world wonder, a page appeared to me that they sent me a link to the email to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds the registration to the email and the phone number and the data simply did not exclude, as he claims.
So I again communicated this to technical support that they simply lie (either intentionally or do not know what they are writing) because what they write is not true.
I have documented several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so "fake" registration simply does not affect this.
For this, Tipsport wrote me an austere sentence - I'm sorry, but by being registered again, we can't check your statement.
And he ended the communication.
Respectively, it repeats the same sentence that registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the email and so it didn't even happen.
So, if I summarize, Tipsport not only did not delete the data as it claims, but still lies when it claims otherwise.
Even worse, it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things started to move a little bit and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter is being forwarded for review and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and guessing and warning of the same error).
We're sorry to kill, but we're innocent, Khmer Rouge leaders defend themselves
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population, lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution.
The commander of the infamous S-21 prison was sentenced to life in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are allegations of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing they were acting in the nation's best interest and had no idea what the true extent of the killing was.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervene and correct the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge cadres to "mistreated or killed people to deny food or genocide."
But he acknowledged "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP that she could not accept Nuon Cheo's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"She doesn't care about others," she said.
"If he had not issued orders, his subordinates would not have killed," she added, noting that Khmer Rouge leaders were "worse than monsters."
The Khmer Rouge regime's "foreign minister" Ieng Sara, who died in March this year, was also scheduled to stand trial.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then the Minister of Social Affairs, was found in an incapable trial in September 2012.
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman made the first ice cream to shine in the dark – using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous treat.
The idea came when he read a professional treatise on jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically produce the protein that causes luminescence.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s tongue – it increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore the more you lick, the brighter it glows.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (lick me, I taste great), says: "It's an amazing fabric, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so for 200 GBP you get about 2 g of this fabric."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've tested it over the last few months and it seems like a great idea for celebrating Halloween because it's causing this fantastic radiant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the lighting of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every scoop costs me about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make invisible ice cream."
In essence, it is impossible because of the light fracture caused by the crystals of ice that make up the ice cream, but I count on finding some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.

The price of oil fell further to 96 dollars per barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about high stocks were offset by a report that showed the strengthening of China's energy-cracking manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil indicator for December deliveries fell 14 cents in late morning in European e-commerce on the New York trade exchange to 96.24 dollars a barrel.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents and for the month of October, it lagged 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves have weighed in price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. stocks have risen 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, from two reports on Chinese production, came the impetus to greater demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which rose to 7.8 percent after the previous two weak decades.
Brent crude oil, an indicator for international oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents per barrel on the International Trade Exchange in London.
Martin Doctor on problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth hint at a slight smile and then just take a deep breath: "It's challenging."
Cooperation with the organizing team of the 2014 Sochi Olympics is a little more complicated, according to Martin Doktor.
We can forget what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same way," the head of the Czech Olympic mission claims.
What specifically is happening?
A lot of things work slower and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of supplying information about essential things not so much.
Perhaps we have been lamenting them for three months to tell us how the villages will be officially marked so that we can do a whole lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting and they're still saying they're communicating the thing.
They still communicate on a number of things.
Is the Olympic Village at least finished?
But it's no longer a disastrous state.
We used to walk around empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean to be empty?
Do you need ready-made floors?
Just the basic concrete, that's the condition a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive there as a van on January 26, he will still smell glue there.
And if they don't make it, what?
President Putin would have driven the army there?
That's exactly how it's gonna happen.
Just so it's not that the Olympic village = Potemkin's village.
Rather, they are in danger of failing to make the journeys, for example, they do not finish the details.
They may have roads in such a state that we'll have to bring our London plays boots with us.
But I believe they'll put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although depending on the nomination criteria, that number is changing.
Maybe the figure skaters will probably be in the three of them who went out.
No one has to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should not fly there until January 26.
What the houses in the Olympic Village will look like, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves by metro so that we wouldn't just believe sketches.
We also prepare a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the mission chief do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am doing a common agenda in the sense of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Instead of a post-election candlelight post-election stew
The October election, rather than the winner, brought a bunch of losers.
It is not just the parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD due to its internal split.
Politicians served us a post-election stew instead of a holiday candlestick over the weekend.
The Andrej Babiš movement became the jumper of the election, which promised voters to change the current political style of governance.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party play a role in the political (out) will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the president has lost a strategic lead over other politicians due to the unpleasant event, he still has a few ways to get him back - for example, by selecting a future prime minister.
While the ČSSD is moving away from the chances of winning the prime minister’s seat in my eyes, businessman Andrej Babiš is approaching.
The post-election development is still a mile away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of the ČSSD supported by the Communists, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.
Due to the loud opposition of YES to get together with the ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still the coalition of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies).
Due to the split in the ČSSD, which thus became an illegible and weak parterre in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be quite daunting for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD, composed with the "non-zemanites" in the Castle, will probably not pass.
Moreover, any government in which the CSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to a further split in the party.
So I ask myself, "Aren't we going to make the next early election?"
The next election would be more of a referendum on the strength of the Yes movement's electoral mandate.
The CSSD’s plans to introduce sector taxes, significantly increase income taxes or build state banks have fallen under the table.
On the contrary, the parties ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit agree, for example, on the promotion of entrepreneurship, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the support of employment of disadvantaged people, lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The friction areas are most common in view of social policy and the size of the state.
But YES now has the upper hand, so the agenda of the most likely coalition of YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean rather to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better outcome than a left-wing tax program for everything that still moves in the economy.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, money was thrown away for overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as reasons.
According to the election results, it can be concluded that most citizens were comfortable with this situation.
That they didn't really mind and were actually satisfied with the situation that was here (theft and indebtedness of this state).
Otherwise, I can’t explain that 3 413 497 voters did not appear at the polls, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS a total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original governing coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is an absolute majority.
When I add 1 016 829 voters to the above-mentioned parties, then with the old order (because all these parties participated in the "theft" and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of the rightful voters actually agreed with this state.
In fact, the majority of voters have made it clear that they are not in favor of punishing the culprits of the step and over-indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who participated in this will take part in the appropriate laws?
Is there even a help to help us?
Olomouc will open a public ice rink in the historic centre
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Spálený said that the preparatory work on the rink was started on 26. October and since Wednesday, the ice-making unit is in operation.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The rink has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took up 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two stocks with punch.
"We have expanded the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stands and almost the entire area of the stage is roofed so that the skaters can comfortably change," Spálený described.
The streets of Olomouc are already commemorating the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square due to the repair of the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate right in front of City Hall in 2009, when the rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice surface then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will begin on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.
The researchers explained more about how tail movements were related to the dog's mood
Previous research has shown that joyful dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wave their tails mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say other dogs can record these subtle differences in tail movement and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different links to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
We tried to observe the same thing in other species.
He added that, as is the case in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information on how dogs respond to the disproportionate wagging of other dogs' tails, researchers monitored animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and other times to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have screened dog films about dogs - either in the natural version or in the form of a silhouette - to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and represent it more to the right or left."
When the animals saw an otherwise bland dog moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), it remained absolutely calm.
But when she noticed the filming of the tail mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging his tail), their heart rate increased and the animals seemed uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think dogs would communicate with each other consciously through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they have to and do not have to look out for.
He said: "If you encounter dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior, and movement to the right breeds less friendly behavior, you will respond based on this experience."
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, vets and trainers better understand their animals' emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a university teacher at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides were important to dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found out that dogs were turning their heads to the left when they were watching an aggressive dog, and on the right, looking at a cheerful dog.
And in another expert treatise from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to be familiar with the dog robot when it was wagging its tail to the left than the right, when they were becoming more uncertain, exactly the opposite of the Italian study."
According to him, the difference can be due to the fact that dogs in these different studios did not interpret animals in movies or dog robots completely like dogs.
He explained that a study could help on how dogs react to real dogs.
“Although in the case of many different mammals there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and other times to the other.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that global investigations by control authorities regarding suspicious machinations with the currency market are becoming more common.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with competent authorities on investigations into the world's largest financial market, where they change owners every day to US$5.3 trillion.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended as part of an expanded investigation that is a response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Interest Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension but confirmed it had received a request from authorities for information this month.
"Our ongoing search on this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the event said RBS had handed over to the UK authority financial behaviour records of emails and instant messages sent from accounts and to the former trader's accounts.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been released from his current position as European foreign currency trading president at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European chairman of the trade for ready-made money in Citi, took a holiday this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders has been charged with any offences.
Mr. Usher's instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people inside with the event said.
UBS said this week that after Swiss control authority Finma announced it was investigating suspicious machinations in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, it took action against some of its employees.
Globally, at least six offices – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Authority of Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – are investigating claims that these bankers have become together to move the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse additionally launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are combing through years-old quick messages and emails to find cases of some offenses.
Reports of investigations alarmed traders in the area, which was one of the biggest profit-making engines in the closures of investment banks in recent years, but which was disrupted by the fact that small currency volatility limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the gravity of the situation when they argued that with a vast and highly liquid foreign currency market, it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this is not necessarily true.
The high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of day trading in a foreign currency, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that "you may start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released a trader from its share trading department this week, which caused a loss of nearly US$6 million late last year.
The bank immediately alerted the competent authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
"We are confident that this trader acted alone and that this issue has been resolved," Credit Suisse said in a statement.
He negotiated the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babiš.
The People's Party won fourteen MPs in the elections, or only a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of YES.
But they enter into negotiations for government with at least one advantage.
In the team that has already begun to argue the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who tuned the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
This time it will probably be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal back then," Kasal estimates of how this year's talks will unfold.
The driver was fined 1,000 pounds for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on 27 May in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.
When police stopped him, they found she had a cup of drink between her thighs.
In a police court in Colchester, Howie pleaded guilty to alleging that he was driving carelessly and inattentively.
Seven points were added to his account, as a result of which he received a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to reimburse 90 pounds and a premium for the accused 100 pounds.
I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have the juice, the lust and the enthusiasm
For Prospal, family has always come first, so he wants to submit to it fully at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or he's definitely done with hockey.
"I want to play the role of daddy and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for the offer.
Despite being a renowned worker who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and can pull off his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," he reports determinedly.
He may be waiting, reportedly, the New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season and have two supports injured - forwards Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does your arrival at Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, it's not worth dealing with.
I know an article in the New York Post came out that they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere was it delivered that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce that I have a contract, but it just isn't.
You haven't even heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place every day.
That's where it's about getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When, for example, a player is injured or someone is not able to do it and the manchaft does not step.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get the contract.
But there are similar circumstances in New York, right?
Injured is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make it into the season, so there's a certain chance, don't you think?
Of course, the chance is always.
The second thing is that you always need two sides for that.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't received one yet.
Unfortunately, this is the reality in which I have to live.
You're flying to America on Friday, expecting something to click after all?
I have expectations from 5. July, when the free agent market opened up in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
I'm definitely not, I'm going to Tampa to see the kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and to seeing you again.
Do you have a schedule?
This is because I am a father and a husband, and that is what is happening.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of dad and husband and I'm really looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday, Vasik has two hockey games, this is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking of doing this in full-time quotes?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I really enjoyed it.
One day it will get to such a stage that all the goals, wins and passes will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Let's get the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play the NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, sporting success comes first - apart from my family.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
This is what family life is based on.
My children, sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we would love to see them continue this trend.
Because what we're going to tell ourselves, in America, there are options somewhere else.
We should offer them that chance.
Are you planning to stay in America permanently?
We'll practice it like we're going to do it until now.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic in Hluboká and around České Budějovice.
And in the winter again in Tampa or where our steps take us.
That's ideal, always being warm.
I've been very lucky in my life.
I can say I went to meet him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I could choose where to live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want this to choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have the will to work hard at your age, train hard and wait for an offer?
Yeah, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have in the NHL that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell you how much longer it's gonna stay there.
That can't be planned.
So you can say you're going to wait this season to see how it goes and then decide what to do next?
I'm at the stage where I'm going day by day.
Distant planets, black and white films, and a bit of fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would pitch casually.
In the concept of his quartet, which will conclude this year’s festival of Strings of Autumn in the large hall of Prague’s Lucerna on November 6, everything is related to everything.
The score of the quartet of the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the current feelings of the musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are supposed to play what they are experiencing right now.
They treat music as a completely improvised chamber matter and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film paintings.
However, this principle of the newly aged eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, bearer of nine Grammys, former teammate of Miles Davis and now probably the greatest living jazz saxophonist - does not like to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my eighties, I came to the conclusion that it is best to be surprised by life.
"Too many people are planning everything and then they're disappointed when things turn out differently," Shorter argues.
Jagr joked: A goal from a break?
He won the puck in the defensive zone and no one caught it anymore.
Moreover, he transformed the leak after a quick forend loop.
Jaromír Jágr scored like this against Tampa on the night of Wednesday, and on Thursday night the 119th NHL goal was commented on the social networking site Facebook.
"After watching this video, the director of Czech Railways contacted my agent Petr Svoboda and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their most modern train Pendolino!" Jágr wrote at the beginning with exaggeration.
They say we're very similar in type.
I'll probably have to finish my night's workouts so I don't speed up any more.
"I'm afraid that the defense minister might then get in touch and want to do a jet commercial!" he added with the smileys.
New Jersey also claimed its second consecutive win.
"And most importantly, you've noticed - treatment with Maria Rottrová works," Jagr concluded.
The brutal murder of a senior citizen in the Zlín region will be dealt with again by the regional court
The regional court acquitted a twenty-five-year-old Slovak and twenty-two-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men denied the blame.
They face between 15 and 20 years in prison or an exceptional sentence.
The spokesman, Petr Angyalossy, confirmed that the High Court had overturned the regional decision and returned the matter to him for consideration.
The reasons that led the judge to do so declined to comment, saying the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the youths ambushed a seventy-seven-year-old man at his home.
Senior died a tormented death.
According to the indictment, the men strangled him, beat and kicked him all over his body, and also with a metal object, apparently a gas gun, planted about three dozen wounds to the head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull bone, swelling of the brain or bleeding in the brain, which he succumbed to on the spot.
The young men reportedly took about 3000 crowns from the house and jewelry worth about 14 thousand crowns.
According to the regional court, the only, in addition, only circumstantial evidence against the defendants was the smell traces, which the expert evaluated as not fully established within the meaning of the legal instructions.
Although the odour traces from the crime scene and other things in more than ten cases coincided with the defendants, the police initially treated them as factual and not scent traces.
In addition, there were some errors in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the defendants' guilt was not proven without a doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
The emergency medical officer did not warn of the violent death.
After a few days, the criminals were contacted by Olomouc doctors, who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
Police were no longer able to work with all the traces from the scene, which relatives had cleaned up.
No DNA of the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in the Uherskohradiště region.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was finally upheld by the Olomouc High Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six youths, who were responsible for the robbery of a goldsmith's shop.
The robberies happened in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopný.
The younger of the accused in the murder of a senior resides in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Can Czech Television ever do without signature events?
She entered the era of President Zeman through the legendary scene with an ashtray, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaint that collects documents for the pros.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík has not been documented in this way, let alone signed under it.
True, the editors stood up for the leadership.
The cases described, however, do not answer the question of where such attachment of some journalists to the Zemanites comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or, so that we do not use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of inappropriate empathetic helpfulness.
And when we assume a general rot, it is impossible to forgive the question whether other, no less scrupulous power interests, which have not yet been given the opportunity, will seek to change the circumstances on television.
Those who say that there are no occasional attempts to intervene in politicians in developed countries are wrong.
But the truth is also that this does not mean that there would be no complaints about the public media.
Complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize above all what they consider to be the tendency inherent in them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this stage of civilization yet, and this situation is not here.
But perhaps also in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about evil politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a confusing situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings comes across.
While there were crowds of horse-demonstrating experts gathering in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he has not yet gone to school and only made his first steps a few months ago, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly twisted through three rounds to eventually win the top prize and leave behind 30 protracted adult rivals.
This inseparable pair – with the same height – was praised for their appearance, manners and style at the annual competition run by Sunnybank’s equestrian centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret to a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee promenade along the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control the horse, which far exceeded his age.
And Toffee earned the highest grades for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee on his third birthday in March and has been practicing daily with this Shetland pony ever since.
His mother, Donna (30), said, "Fenton and Toffee are working together very well."
They didn't have high hopes, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffeo, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought him phenomenal and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing off horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells says: "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded."
He ran on the sand along the entire length of the arena and although he seemed so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has been in charge of two chickens.
Considering how he started, he will be back at the Horse of the Year competition again, and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse demonstration competition said: "The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control a pony."
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork is between the pony and the one who leads it – and Fenton and Toffeo were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's adorable clothes helped, he really fit in with him.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in connection with surveillance by the US
Edward Snowden, a snitch from U.S. intelligence agencies, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP handed to the media on Friday in Berlin, said: "Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition like a defector and tries to criminalize political speeches with heavy lawsuits that do not give room for defense."
Speaking the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to withdraw the criminal charges filed against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany's interior minister, told Zeit Online magazine: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
Tensions in the relationship between the U.S. and Germany began to rise when claims emerged that the NSA had eavesdropped on Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees the news, said that if there was any opportunity to interview Mr. Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and that relations with the US would be completely destroyed," it should be done.
Mr Sträbel, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
On his trip to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to the former NSA attorney, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe there," a member of parliament said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a harsh and persistent campaign linked to persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the world's response to his "act of political expression" gave him courage.
Citizens throughout and across the country have evaluated the revelations of an unjustified system of pervasive surveillance for service to the public.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
So I don't get swayed by hate
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel, Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it will not be a slim volume suggests the number of parties comparable to his most famous work Houština (Petrov, 2001).
Another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl - interviewed for Salon Kahudu.
What moved you after twelve years of silence?
I did it - so I wouldn't get swollen with hate.
To see around you all the time new and new clones of that human foolish pettiness, young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavors.
I'm not even talking about the elders, faces ruined by powerless desire, rowdy souls and oppositely over-polar ideologues who try to sell their "product" with the expression of a small selling whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my jurodious friends, weirdos and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brains burning out of life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks and then I read books at the lamp in the evening.
You're talking about a sense of devastation, of hatred.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The turning point came a long time ago, at about ten years old.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, that's what I was living after.
There's still a quiet boy somewhere inside.
I see more lonely exercisers, each in their tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I participate in that huge, thousand-year-long movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, when the trial-and-error process creates another and next generation of beings who, in trillions of interactions per second, create some superhuman, artistic intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather, a dialogue that leads the right and left half of the brain, occasionally floats to the surface and forms into a book.
As the periods of peace are interwoven with silently sleeping metastases of wars that may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I could feel the mute avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn't do anything, it would one day quietly overwhelm me.
It is a set of questions that the brain has formulated and asks them to layers that are stored in the darkness "under the surface of consciousness."
The neocortex, the gray cortex of the brain, asks older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient tree rings of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, asks the serpents, seeks the answer in the flight of birds, lifts his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain preserves in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, is used by the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is constantly exposed to a variable presence, in an unfailing effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overloading disorders.
By analogy - as if you "fell" your PC, from the speech emulator program and translator from foreign languages you would get tangled first in the operating environment, for example, Windows, and after several failed restarts ended up with a dark green flashing screen of Bios, in the basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about - I'm talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why do you regularly interest this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the still functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a rift appears.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He has been looking into the abyss so long that the abyss has looked into him."
A pure feeling - that a person is lost if all hope disappears, mentally "dies" and a new quality begins.
And why do I care about it personally?
I will respond with a parable.
Once one fell into a pool and drowned, days, months and years were running, he was still drowning and reading, and the books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a "diver."
Perhaps someone will be helped by a sentence written by me, as Hrabal's lyrics once helped me.
To what extent do you think about the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about whom nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but in my opinion it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word and sentence formulation."
From an early age he reads books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo's submarine, ran around the Shades in the dark streets.
In the end, behind all the branches of the authors and their message, it reads: "The Sun of the Bright Worlds of Others by Karel Hynek Mácha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
On the retrospect that gets to you through people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, perhaps after years, they contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some difficult life decision.
Books are actually "lives" or, better said, "worlds."
They are encoded in the characters of letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of whichever language.
Whenever we can bring them to life when we let their sentences flow to the brain.
It is, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the book is published, you - as it happens - are waiting for a chain of authorial readings.
I remember you used to like reading.
Are you happy to get into it again, or do you feel it differently after years?
Today I prefer to just talk.
And what did I find out about that?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they are inconspicuous, they do not draw much attention to themselves, they have friendly radiances, you do not feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec lived (and I hope he still lives) one curly bookseller (it is appropriately called Červenka), a cheerful friend and a good girl's bull.
During one drinker, he presented me with individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Houština.
I stared into their eyes and then I was shown a crumbling, revered specimen of my book.
I was embarrassed to put down the just-read jitter and wept briefly.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and tearing drunkenly.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn't stand it, and with a roar he jumped out of the window into a snowdrift.
It was downstairs.
We ran out into the night landscape, and they ran a happy rabies of sensitive people, the sore soul of the compatriots, and the lament of the sunken patriots - howling and pampering like werewolves until morning.
Every book you have is formally and content different from the previous ones.
Is this also true of the text Wind, darkness, present?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about one land behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his novel Suchodol, Ivan Bunin puts the words of an old Russian myth in the mouth of a folk healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog lying on it, a gray chest on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps we were devils in hell a long time ago and drawn - what role we will play on this earth.
Do you want to keep writing, or will you leave it again on the free tide of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our will from such a depth and in such a wide range that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so, of course, we act exactly in the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die in the defense and acquisition of new personal territories.
Sometimes a disorder happens and we exude compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disturbances, standing on the ocean coast unconscious and catching the tides of warm wind into a leaky sail made from a dirty handkerchief.
I have to write to be human.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
During the lessons of English literature, it will be necessary to study at least one of Shakespeare's plays, a 19th-century novella, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include "hidden text" to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English Literature and Language Courses will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to have a language graduation exam, and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective course.
The Department of Education is due to issue a new curriculum tomorrow for English and mathematics – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
Other major items are expected to change next year.
In a separate step, the Ofqual Office, which oversees the graduation exams, reveals changes in the structure of the graduation exam, together with the new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech this summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our exam system in order to regain the confidence of society" and that there was a need to insist that the graduation exam be "more challenging, ambitious and stricter."
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia devote an average of 143 hours a year to mathematics and about 138 in Singapore.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that a comprehensive graduation exam in mathematics – along with a greater emphasis on this subject in the scoreboards – is likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-world problems,” including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: I am not the cancer in the CSSD
Before the elections, a long-smoldering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the ČSSD in Ostrava was fully flared.
It all culminated when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, turned to the court for the undemocratic formation of the candidates.
Nevertheless, the actors of the case did not want to comment too much on this, so as not to harm the party even more before the election.
But now the votes of the voters are numbered.
The leadership of the ČSSD in Ostrava called on the mayor of Ostrava on Monday evening to leave the party, and will probably also push him to lose his position.
Petr Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What is going on in the disputes and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for the Journal.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
The CSSD certainly counted on a much better result.
Did it hurt her that there were disputes within the party in the media before the election?
I imagine that Social Democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the CSSD is now.
It's a party that has its internal problems, it's internally ill, and people perceive it that everything is not right in it.
They made that clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the CSSD?
I think the ODS has been going through bankruptcy for some time now, and unfortunately such things are taking place in social democracy.
It is that the lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS, have moved to the people of the ČSSD and have influence over them.
It is then related to the fact that the police go around the offices of the Ostrava Municipality and collect computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not only composed of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
The ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between the Haškovs and the Sobotkovs.
But even that has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a harbinger of what is happening now in Prague.
Hašek's wing gradually occupied positions so that after the election it could provoke a situation that weakens Sobotka's wing.
One is in a situation in politics where one sometimes has to approach compromises.
But everyone has an internal limit where they can no longer compromise, and that is my case.
Originally, I did not want to run for the Chamber of Deputies, but when I perceived the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get to the regional candidate, so that as the mayor of Ostrava I could strengthen Sobotka's wing.
But Hašek's wing gave it a stop.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, and not Michal Hašek?
In my opinion, Slávek Sobotka is a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and, to a certain extent, about the visions for the party and for this country.
I have to admit, I haven't heard anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only start dismissing the party chairman.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the tents of the party.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has just demonstrated in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you feel that the Ostrava leadership of the ČSSD did not approve you of the candidate.
Political parties are based on a competition, who will be placed among their members.
This competition should, for the most part, be based on programmatic visions and on those people's abilities to fulfill those visions.
Of course, people who do not have much ability or vision are also involved in this competition, but the political party is a lift to the money they would not have received elsewhere.
The problem is when these people start to come to the fore thanks to the fact that without scruples they break the rules, they violate the party's statutes.
They make the mafia from political parties with their practices and I think they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to take into account whether a Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
Therefore, before the elections, did you file a petition to the court for a preliminary injunction against the form of a ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by the fact that organizations that do not suit it can abolish, purposefully establish new organizations, gradually throw away inconvenient members of the party.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then rather annulled the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that seeking compliance with the party’s statutes through the courts is the last resort, but at the moment when the other ways and control authorities within the CSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The effort of the leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD headed by MP Adam Rykala is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumír Palyza, is interested in this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to dismiss me.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and for those votes, they consolidate their power in the party.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the stadium Bazaly was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could label me as a person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
In doing so, the city bought property that is strategically of great value to it.
So how do you see it with your stay as mayor?
The District Committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the CSSD.
But I think it's like a thief shouting, "Catch a thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I do not see anyone in the Ostrava Social Democracy who would initiate and enforce, sometimes against members of the party, the emergence of so many developing things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Still, everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than that I'm in the way of others to break through to the places they desire.
Will you still fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is to work well, then political parties must work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively run the state if it can't even run itself.
I’m not thinking of leaving the CSSD now because I think that the person who causes cancer of this party is not me, but these people who are trying to drive me out.
We want to show that Pilsen still knows how to win, Rajtoral promises
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful recently, defender or midfielder Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has the form that earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He also manages to shoot, he is active, after the procedure he was ordered a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice after the victory, but in the end she took a single point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break the unpleasant series in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will beat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match with the North Bohemians, who play offensive football.
Everything is going to the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech representative invites fans to the Doosan Arena's stands.
Pilsen's last matches have not gone the way she would have liked, but the word crisis defender Victoria rejects.
That's how it is in football, sometimes you have good form and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any way.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," the defender of the West Bohemians said.
The Victoria team will again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's played on Friday night and that's what I'd like to invite our fans, who are great, to be invited."
"I believe we'll repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to both Zeman and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on students, educators and the management of high schools and universities in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign carried out by President Miloš Zeman at schools.
I was more or less successful.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who rejected the lecture of the honorary chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received a rematch in the form of a non-invitation to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer so brave and allowed the visit of Miloš Zeman: Brno University of Technology, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolín, J.E. University. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now seeing a continuation of the enforcement of politics at universities in Pardubice.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not the same as if you stayed, for example, as mayor of a smaller town.
Do you want to join the governors of the ČSSD, who are simultaneously forging the position of MP and Governor and, like them, degrading both professions?
This means that you can handle both of these demanding functions with the left rear.
I know, we have an example of Michal Hašek, who can even handle several dozen functions at once.
This is not an example of the person you should be following.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post so that she could fully devote herself to the management of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean is that by concurring the functions, you will violate the politicality of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current activities in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help "your" school without remaining dean.
I think that your students will have a similar opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
Consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen that the voters will count on you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to last long.
John Kerry admitted: Spying has gone too far!
The United States has occasionally gone "too far" in spying, according to AFP, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the minister, the collection of information was used to avert terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington" was heard in the midst of a fierce controversy on both shores of the Atlantic over scandalous revelations about mass surveillance of data by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which has also targeted U.S. allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended the previous practice.
He said the collection of information is necessary to fight terrorism and prevent assassinations, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US, the Madrid assassinations in March 2004 and London in July 2005.
"We prevented the planes from falling, the buildings exploded and people were murdered because we were able to be informed of the plots in a timely manner," Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone disproportionately far."
The affair surrounding U.S. intelligence, which reportedly tracked hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also watching the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their outrage, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would foresee or significantly limit surveillance.
The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) had been charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission on Child Sex Abuse learned that before charges were filed against child educator Jonathan Lord of the city of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexually abusing children.
But it was said before the commission that in its opening statement to the commission, the association said it had never addressed a case of sexual abuse of a child in its organization.
Chief Executive Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one of the YMCA's employees was charged with misdemeanors involving child pornography, and another when a gym teacher at Caringbah of the YMCA was convicted in 1991 of sexual harassment of children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the commission's adviser, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that YMCA's initial statement was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out at YMCA, which recognized the organization as a leading advocate of children's rights.
The evidence presented by the commission indicates that YMCA was warned that in an audit by the Ministry of Education and Society from August this year, it received the second lowest of the four possible assessments.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the management had failed from him downwards when he accepted Mr Lord without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually harassing 12 boys he committed during his two years working at the YMCA.
He was jailed for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected claims that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented the staff from reporting the child safety breach by Mr Lord.
Staff members gave evidence that they witnessed such violations, including that the Lord was alone with the children, guarding them privately, letting them sit with them on their laps, telling them that he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked to train for the safety of the children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of services to children at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often find it difficult to talk to him about anything."
The chief executive said he did not accept the staff's evidence that they felt uneasy if they were to contact their superiors and report the deeds.
Instead, he said their friendship with the Lord had obscured their judgment and therefore did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that he had communicated to the YMCA Board in New South Wales that the lessons of Jonathan Lord's "case for the organisation" were that the staff had "not filed a report" and the board agreed with him on this.
Mr. Hare said the decision to let the staff sign the confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations surfaced, made the general manager for child service at YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid damaging the evidence, but it was "overly zealous" and poorly executed.
Expert on child sexual abuse Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not an organisation that would be safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, screening, incorporation, training and staff management.
The hearing was adjourned to December 20.
President of the Union of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Green Savings Should Continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been struggling with a continuous decline in the volume of orders and the lack of interest of the state to solve the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measures, will save significant amounts for heating, but also for chances for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2700 newly created jobs to the state.
In terms of the fiscal policy of the state, leverage and multiplier effects are significant, it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
Therefore, the Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic fundamentally disagrees with the resolution of the government and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow the further continuation of the program, so that further calls can be announced within it.
FAA: Air travelers can now use technological gains on aircraft (but not allowed to call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "from gateway to gate" - in addition to calling from their mobile phones - to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music based on the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Passengers should not expect the changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary by airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA how much their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the cabin crew training manuals and equipment storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in a statement.
Passengers are currently required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches an altitude of 3 kilometers and the captain doesn't issue a warrant.
Passengers are expected to shut down their devices again when the plane is down to land, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft, which have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewards Association, welcomed the changes.
“Once the new rules are safely introduced – and we work closely with transport companies – it will be a success,” Glading said.
We are, frankly, tired of looking like “guardians.”
However, surfing the Internet, sending emails and texting or downloading data will continue to be banned below 3 kilometers of altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was, as is well known, thrown off an American Airlines plane because he refused to shut down his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored because of fears that they could injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for using cellphones are not determined by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from the FCC data that they can cause interference in the air through the broadcast towers," Rosenker said.
The field advisory committee created by the FAA administration to investigate the issue, last month suggested that the government allow wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, say there is no rightful security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is pervasive.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget the obligation to shut down their devices or ignore it.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to interference by navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, technical achievements of the time.
The new airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous-generation aircraft, but are also constructed, and approved by the FAA's administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at altitude travel.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt under the new rules to greater use of electronic devices, Ms Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio transmission than was the case with previous generations' devices.
For example, e-readers emit only minimal broadcasts when turning the page.
But broadcasting is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those pushing to free up restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the airliner with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed sentiments regarding whether these facilities posed any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the interference from those devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said there were only fragmentary reports from pilots designed to support the fact that such devices could cause the aerospace systems to be compromised, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut down the device while flying by instruments in low visibility.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes and it is a reasonable procedure for the travelling public, which uses the technology to an abundant extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, chief executive of the American Travel Association.
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said U.S. espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry suggested a refinement of the U.S. defense position on his surveillance programs and said in an unprecedented admission that in some cases espionage had "gone too far."
The secretary of state also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as an "autopilot" in view of the angry revelations about NSA spying activities that appeared thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The releases sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video-link at an open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that have been going on out of inertia, because the possibility was there, with reference to the Second World War, a difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, 9/11."
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was seeking good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly determined to murder and blow people up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to capture and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented the planes from falling, the buildings did not explode, and people were not executed because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The president of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday that U.S. lawmakers were going to Europe to respond to fears about foreign affairs relating to alleged U.S. espionage, and to convince Europeans the need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about their threats to stop participation in anti-terrorist organizations because they were disillusioned by the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national security interests of the US, it is really important that Europe stays with us in the same boat, in view of the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations for European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I'm heading to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue to work with terrorism regardless of their anger over the NSA's programs.
Reports in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some U.S. allies, even though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected misunderstandings of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another revelation quoted documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA was tracking the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the espionage of the allies as necessary, saying it was a common matter from both sides.
In the middle of the turmoil, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year, and hopes members of both parties and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other lawmakers who intend to get involved are due to be published.
He said the program was still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the goal of the trip was to help repair relations, he added that "well-intentioned educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs that they have been using themselves for years.
“While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they, too, must realize that we are not the only ones who are conducting espionage here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to the hostility triggered by the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
For the words "Mugabe is a limp donkey" there is no longer a threat of jail time, the court repealed the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to be careful about the way they talk in public about the eighty-nine-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and since the end of 1987, then heads it.
According to Section 33 of the Criminal Code, a fine of 100 dollars to one year in prison was threatened with a violation of the presidency.
"State prosecutors should not zealously blame people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal the court's decision, the BBC reported.
A number of damaged Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in an argument with a bar police officer, were loudly opposed to the law.
In May, an opposition activist in prison, frequenting Mugabe's swearing "limp donkey," ended up in jail.
In August, the prosecutor charged a twenty-six-year-old man over his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared it an unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be untrue," Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala said.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to twenty years in prison.
"The existence of a law allowing criminalizing someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to express themselves freely," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil liberties in March, following a referendum.
A small step from the dictatorship of one man of the country took place in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabo and the opposition carried Morgan Tsvangiraj into the prime minister's seat.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100 000 percent.
In 2009, the government abolished the national currency.
Today, only the currencies of other countries are paid in Zimbabwe.
The impoverished economy is at the expense of Mugabe's inconsiderable agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with running farms.
Young couple mature to live with parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the task of designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the land itself sloping somewhat.
The requirement was that two generations would live in the house, which would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
Therefore, the architects decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"In creating the design, we respected family bonds, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected through several paths through the exterior of the building, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their own privacy," the designers explain.
The household of parents is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are linked.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in the different final modification of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was sculpted using panels from planks, the part where the office is plastered white and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very intertwined with the exterior.
The household of parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance to the family.
The interconnection of the interior with the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and from there climbs up the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to fall through them cascadingly.
It was in this way that the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique on it.
The household of the young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with a sliding door.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a clean combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the lobby and from there climbs up the staircase.
Firefighters came to rescue the missing puppy, who was stranded 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in the quarry
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was caught sight of a man walking a dog in a quarry.
Firefighters rappelled down the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by fire units, who came to rescue him after somehow self-imprisoned on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry of 15 meters above the ground.
Ruby's nine-month-old cocker spaniel escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days alone until he was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) with his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, they feverishly searched for their missing dog and placed calls on social media.
On Wednesday, at about 14.15, a bright-eyed dog owner saw a stranded Ruby on a protrusion in a quarry of 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene and rappelled down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to pick him up the rock.
Technical rescue team commander Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't move his eyeboll in the rescue - he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
He got the cookies.
It was a very unusual exit.
The fact that someone saw a dog is incredible.
Peter Lau, the technical rescue team's assistant commander, said: "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, "I was scared at the sight of the rescue."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him in your arms again.
The vet said that if he had exhausted himself too much and collapsed, he would probably have fallen.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just tremendous.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The firefighters were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
A cooling tower burned down at night in the ČKD industrial complex in Prague
A large-scale reservoir was burning in the ČKD industrial complex in Prague, according to firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
"Firefighters were already driving to the fire on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, this morning they were still extinguishing the fire," said Pavlína Adamcová, a spokeswoman for the Prague fire department.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the ambient according to the measurement did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the cause of the fire are still unknown.
Approximately five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the premises in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a large-scale tank fire, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we extinguish the transport line from the tankers," she added.
According to news server tn.cz, the extinguishing of a poorly functioning network of hydrants complicated, so firefighters had to deliver water from elsewhere.
The fire department's intervention commander has declared a second fire alarm.
There are four levels in total, in the most serious situations the fourth is announced.
Chemists also went to the scene to verify the level of dangerous substances that could have reached the air during the fire.
"But they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that exceeded the hygiene standards," a fire department spokeswoman said.
A 325 million dollar rescue package for Tasmanian health
The federal government insists that a $325 million rescue package for a dying health service in Tasmania includes tough conditions that ensure the state government does not waste funding.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is taking "expedited measures" to avert the crisis caused by the island's aging population, higher numbers of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The funding for four years was decided following government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilki.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," Ms. Plibersek said today.
The 325 million dollar package contains 31 million dollars for operations at the request of the patient.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopedic operations and cataract operations, will help eliminate indebtedness.
The money is also for freely accessible clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the launch of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the ideas that leading clinicians have told me would best help the Tasmanian health system," Ms. Plibersek said.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting and registration obligation regime.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the Australian Union's money, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member committee will be appointed to ensure that the state supplies services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that 325 million dollars will be of no use "until a real reform is followed to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system."
Still, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first raised in talks with the prime minister in early May.
"I believe that the federal auxiliary package can extricate the state public health system from critical condition," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Peter Dutton, a spokesman for the federal health station, said today's statement was just a "patch."
"The reason I'm here is because the Labour government has taken 430 million dollars out of our health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union, which is donating 300 million dollars, and pretending it's good news.
Mr Dutton urged Ms. Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar from the rescue package would be spent on higher bureaucracy.
There's music playing on the Blush subway
Transport company of the capital m. (DPP) Prague launched the project Music in the Metro.
The first vestibule where the reproduced instrumental music is continuously played during the operation of the metro is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The trial operation will last six months.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghettos, they are supposed to ease tensions
Police specialists should work in ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half of their errands here.
They would oversee order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior is counting on this.
According to him, the improvement of the situation in the country would be helped mainly by "fast-tracked provision of social housing."
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were around 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, mainly Roma.
Adults in ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
She was usury.
According to experts of troubled localities, in the meantime, it has increased by a hundred.
Relations between their inhabitants and others are intensifying.
Anti-Romani marches were held in several places.
People from around the country also joined the extremists.
According to the interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
A fundamental condition is the "consistent application of equal access in law enforcement."
But this is said to be impossible to achieve without a detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go to errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he would oversee order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or offences.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole series of illegal acts," the interior ministry said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive surcharges, namely 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be paid from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, funds 85 percent.
Preparations have started this year, now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is due to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements here," the report's authors said.
How many specialists there should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will determine the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the end of the project.
According to the project proposal, selected police officers first complete an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should receive this training every year.
From these, the most suitable candidates will emerge.
There should also be a special education for police officers who will work in the ghettos.
According to the authors, mainly social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet hostels with precise rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
Social housing would have a higher standard that would be comparable to normal housing.
Tenants would have to implement an integration plan that would be drawn up with them by social workers.
They would have to follow the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would progress to a higher standard of housing.
According to the interior, the system of permeable housing should work for at least 30 years until the next generation grows "in a pro-integration-motivated environment".
The social housing model is prepared by resorts for local development and work.
They have to propose it by the end of the year.
Together with Bárta, the inspection and the analyst of the anti-corruption police arrested
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news server Firstzpravy.cz brought.
The MF DNES soon discovered that the case was taken hand over by the General Inspection of the Security Forces (GIBS), its people were to arrest Barta in the center of Prague.
It happened outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its power also applies to civilians.
According to the MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - the head of analysts and computer science Jan Petržílek - is among those arrested.
He previously worked for the Security Information Service.
However, Jaroslav Ibehej, a spokesman for the anti-corruption police, declined to comment on the information, adding that the media had to turn to GIBS on this matter.
However, Radka Sandorová, the spokeswoman for the inspection, did not want to say anything about the case, she immediately referred to the Municipal Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office.
Also from this vague reaction it can be inferred that the event took place, but is in a secrecy mode that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
Bárta’s lawyer Oldřich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta "even on this matter", but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bart's arrest.
Some media outlets initially speculated that Bárta's arrest might be related to former police president Petr Lessy.
This was promoted to the position of Bárta together with the former chairman of the VV Radek John, who was sitting at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute, which was flared up between former Prime Minister Petr Nečas and VV, had to be resolved even by the then president, Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from to me.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about things," Lessy told iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, but the real head of the party was Bárta.
Barta has now run for the Dawn movement for the election, his parliamentary mandate has only narrowly escaped him - by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate, and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not or is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy, Tomio Okamura," he said, referring to Bárta, because he helped solve the problem of the bailiffs.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former co-party from VV Jaroslav Škárka.
Foreign workers with a visa privilege may pass the "legitimacy" test
As the government intends to expand police crackdowns, it is considering a “legitimacy” test for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fill unqualified jobs, or as a backdoor for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion paper was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
“Vocal statements ‘foreigners to the end of the front’ and ‘work first for Australians’ are a very unpleasant remnant from when unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white workforce was to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if anyone in this region has seen an echo of this historic artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is in talks with officials over people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
If the "legitimacy" criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether "the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or a personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking."
After previous experience with businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds of them, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka seeking asylum has died with a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat for the Christmas Islands this week.
The man's nine-year-old frightened son travelled to Australia along with him, and after his father's death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities rushed to a hospital in the Christmas Islands where he died.
Israeli military jets attacked target in Syria, responsible official says
Israeli military jets hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, an official responsible for the administration confirmed to Fox News.
The responsible official did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the SA-125 missiles of Russian production.
At least twice before this year, Israel carried out an air strike on missile deliveries in Syria.
She moved from the villa to the block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of Prague’s most beautiful residential areas in Ořechovka.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance.
Ivana was quickly looking for a replacement housing for herself and her older mother.
From acquaintances she got a tip for an apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the large forest park and the dam thrilled me on the other side," Ivana recalls of the first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a provisional for, like, three years.
"Today we have lived here for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction, I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter moved from a hundred-meter apartment to a smaller apartment with an area of 62 m2 and gave away almost all the equipment.
The action was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in pretty good condition, but necessary modifications had to take place, for example, painting the door or replacing the windows.
The previous owner broke down the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and unnecessarily large hallway, and on the contrary, a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used drywall to define the individual zones and divide the room, which allowed the new placement of the lights.
The first intervention she took after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to partially improve the standard was to replace the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana didn't know what to do with the bathroom.
For years I subscribed to magazines about housing and sought inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
On recommendation, I approached the young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana said.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, the layout of the hall was also modified.
The architect combined the space of the toilet and bathroom and replaced the two doors with opening wings with one sliding one, thus saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, at the toilet bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Douděrová continued.
Within the program How to Build a Dream, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room, in which the architect Martin Čeněk also participated.
In the space, which was created by combining two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, residential and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, for example, half-crossbars or Japanese walls.
"This would ultimately violate the openness and uniformity of the space," the architect explains.
It was originally possible to separate the sleeping and living area.
It was enough to turn two sofas with your back and put a custom-made duvet cabinet between them.
The dining area is distinguished by shades of flooring and painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used a high-quality marmoleum, the sliding door brought to life with wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchenette, if necessary, is covered with sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor made of anti-allergic marmoleum has a number of advantages over the previous one from laminate: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted by color is an example of how space can be worked with space in the panel house.
I left the colors to the architects, I wished it was joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphoglass cladding with the motif of blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To a warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were stored, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance.
The remade interior has an excellent contrast between the new and the older, for example, with the decades-old crystal chandelier and the quality art objects that Ivana has collected all her life.
The kitchen came last.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like she was in a tunnel.
The architect took their number and reshaped the deployment.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface softens a slightly pearly surface.
The washing machine, dryer and dishwasher fit into a small space thanks to the imaginative solution.
The appearance of the small kitchen was revived by the all-glass wall covering above the worktop.
Unique graphoglass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is excellently maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolias, which remind her of the favorite neighborhood she lived in for years.
Now she seems to be happy here, too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bathtub and sink, in the new owner chose a neutral shade of cladding.
The large shower room has a glass door, Ronal.
The task was to create a clear simple space from the environment, in which the functions and devices will be in harmony.
We unified the interior materially and in color and tried to make its elegant, cozy, not too crowded appearance.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the availability of everyday items," adds Kamila Douderová.
Minister Holcát renews the position of Head Nurse for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential that this function is clearly defined and formalized, so that nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, the Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be given due attention from the Ministry.
In the exercise of this profession, not only high professionalism is necessary, but also a human approach and personal beliefs.
"I will be happy and with all responsibility to try to enforce those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us much with their approach to patients, to perform their calling with all their empathy and help us in the eyes of the public to improve the image of the sisters," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Head Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated on the occasion of her appointment that she wants to deal with various aspects of the position of a nurse and intends, among other things, to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I fundamentally do not want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, each with his competence and together with other healthcare professionals forming a well-coordinated working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks burden nurses unnecessarily and take away the time they could and should give to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas he intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to cooperate better in a team and with management of health service providers, regulation of competences and also employment issues, such as compliance with the Labour Code or non-overloading of nurses by their insufficient number in a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous missives, but out of fear of possible recourse, are not documented on a specific case where violations of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the position of the Head Nurse of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of the anonymity of such a complaint and have a specific case examined by the competent authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been the head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical disciplines and recognition of qualifications in the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse at the bedside in the internal department, and also worked as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, she has devoted herself to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of a political party.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted the novella by Denise Diderot, which brings an exceptional film quest and a portrayal of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in the 60's of the 18th century in France and tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent by her family to a monastery.
When they rebel, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from the criminally depraved mother of the superior and, for another, becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips into lust or sensationality and that's its problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the fact that even the audience will experience a torment similar to wearing a shackle shirt.
Jana Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it’s not really a step at all, but a big jump – a leap a few years back, into the memories, to my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like not having any worries and just coming home from school and washing dishes, vacuuming and doing your homework.
Although these "duties," it was mostly just the theory, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - to come running from school, throwing the bag into a corner and running out.
Playing ball games with other children, jumping a shot.
Then, during the series, Helena and her boys, embroider a festive tablecloth for Grandma's birthday with a chain stitch.
And then, after several warnings, wash the dishes, vacuum, in winter put the wood in the tiled stove and do the tasks after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of tasks write love verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, have breakfast with homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the jams that are sold now, the contents of which were not even lying next to the strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which my mom and I loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when the grave silence was in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio to the tapes that were loudly filmed in the old tape recorder after my mom.
And then we rewinded the tapes on the pencil and played the same song over and over again, our favorite and toasted the siphon.
Or we used to make phone calls through the table using cans that were tied together with a string - and while we were on the phone to hear each other better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, then the chuch was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live off it in such a way that we lacked nothing.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads or even cellphones and laptops or designer clothes.
The clothes were inherited from generation to generation, and the best "addition" to the wardrobe was a batik T-shirt of home-made with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics, the aforementioned mother's tape recorder was enough to our satisfaction and, at most, Walkman, who we shared with our sister and which, by the way, we used only on the train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, don't be mad, or as I've already mentioned going "only" out.
When I was a little older we got a video player under the tree, surely my parents were saving for a long time, but unfortunately it did not warm up in our country for a long time.
My younger sister stuffed a strudel into it, said he was so beautifully paping the tapes, so she tried to see if he was sleeping the strudel.
Unfortunately he was sleeping, but it was his last bite.
Well, this is still the case to this day, poor thing, on a plate from his dad all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she stuffed the strudel into the video and thought that he would play the recipe and not play it, so he still can not bake it.
I remember when we were all able to communicate with each other, to communicate without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I arranged with my neighbor's granddaughter on holiday, when we will meet again next summer at my grandmother's house - and that's how it was, that's how it was.
We're meeting.
Promise yourself now with someone that you will see each other in a year?!
I also remember the winter when we used to run outside with the whole village, build snowmen, ride on a snowy hill by the church on bags stuffed with hay.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear the notorious phrase before every dinner: "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, this is still true today, but you certainly do not have soap tied in the bathroom to the tap in a lemon net.
After dinner, when my dad was "working" with Jarda from the village in the garage, my mother and I lay down on the floor, leaning our feet against the tiled stove, opening the door and looking at the flame and listening to the crackling of the wood that was pouring from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we spoke - we didn't write daily messages through various chats, text messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew much more about each other.
And this is how I could go on for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at albums where black corners are neatly glued to black and white photos.
And if I didn’t know how old I was, the back of the photo is always written a year of taking the picture.
I look that although the haircuts according to the pot did not suit us very well and in addition we had pants after cousin two numbers bigger, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd better go back to that step - to reality.
Until 2013 and I will wait to see what modern times will come up with maybe one day for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now for the young teenage generation at least somewhere "one hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they are missing a lot, that they will not experience this "forebuster" time either.
I wish they were!
They have to save, the young Czechs know.
Most of them don’t even know what interest
More and more Czechs are putting their money aside.
However, they do not reach the champions in savings in the region.
The most money is deposited by Austrians, who save an average of 181 euros a month.
A little more than the Czechs save people in Slovakia.
This is according to a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving, and two-thirds of respondents plan to put aside more money.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking of savers, in Romania and Serbia people still use the savings products very little.
For example, almost every second Serb saves "under the pillow" at home, according to the survey.
In the Czech Republic this year, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has increased.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents put a thousand to 2.5 thousand crowns on various types of savings, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly deposit in the year-on-year comparison fell slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, compared to last year, the interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly.
Only 16% of respondents use them, compared to almost a quarter of people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what revenues they achieve on individual products.
Young people under the age of 30, in particular, do not know how interest-bearing their money is.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their deposited money, 73 percent of respondents know this among people over fifty years of age.
In international comparison, the Erste Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with 12 percent distance.
Australian woman appeals against stay in Thai prison
A twenty-one-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to a 15-day prison on Phuket Island when she falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver has appealed against the verdict and has been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally 15. In June, accused by a provincial court on Phuket Island of perjury when she told Thai police that a taxi driver along with two other men who were said to have detained her assaulted her in the early hours of Sunday 10. June.
However, an industrial television footage later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Police from Phuket Island held interviews with Bamford for two days before confessing to making up the incident.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than being placed in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Evidently, this is a challenging time, but we hope he will return to us safe as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail of 50 000 baht.
Reports from Australia report that she had meanwhile spent her holiday in the recreation area of Krabi in the south of Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but was warned that the appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in a placement in adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of Australian travel agency employee Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also try to correct a damaged image for tourists, which may have been behind the liberating verdict.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
The lyricist Michal Horáček brought not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar to the hall of the Municipal Social House in Kolín, but also especially in the program Between Us Singers Lenka Nová, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Matěj Benek.
After the opening intro and the acting etude about the delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of how they last played in Cologne and the theater and the whole city dropped the electric current.
"Otherwise in Cologne, they produced two kinds of cards that I came into contact with a lot," he recalled.
He also recalled President Zeman's native.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravec near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and, if not speaking, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touching his new musical achievement.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, but he had no idea about ice hockey at the time, how we meet in those squares and chant, who does not jump, is not a Czech.
That's the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we won't play it here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang for him a very suitable Sleep in the daytime, singing at night and accompanying himself to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band in the composition of a keyboard, a cello, a guitar and a double bass.
All three vocalists sang a little bit of a rebound Together The heartside of the heart sits down, which immediately stirred up the auditorium.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček said.
After the memory of Petr Hapka, I was recognized by František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded with huge applause, Hana Hegerová was reminded of the song Dad liked Lída Baarová and Horáček’s explanation about the communist ban and the replacement of Baarová by the American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the composition Sebastián, Segrado then sang a beautiful composition Prague by the musician Jarda Svoboda, a native of the musician and former Kolíňák.
But that was the conclusion, the applause in the standings and the addition in the form of an optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
There was another addition on the playlist, but the fans did not applaud it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire four of them sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček her books and even the cover from the legendary LP and with potential interested people took a picture.
Recently, the CEO of ČEZ announced that he is postponing the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th units of the Temelín power plant to the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and the approval of Contracts of Difference by the government.
These reasons, the current management of ČEZ tries to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, on behalf of the majority shareholders.
However, a qualified manager should give recommendations to the shareholder, not hide behind it.
Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest because of the parental leave program
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest because of the parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million coal tax acreage, made the claim as he sought to sweep the question of whether he was in conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could have had a personal benefit from the policy in question.
"He has been put into a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if either of his daughters were to become pregnant, he would be directly interested in getting parental leave," Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the fight for the seat behind the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast region thanks to a gain of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the polls close?
"We have to have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into your computer, vote immediately and have results at half past seven in the evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is that the results can be erased if someone doesn't like it?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently made a joint contribution together with New Zealand to the discussion.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political agenda also applies to Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new job "very seriously."
The public office is a service to the public.
"We do not seek any reward other than that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Just eight percent of the firms surveyed said they did not address the matters related to both key codes in their company at all.
This is according to a survey by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which found the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the approaching effective date of both key codes, only now at the last minute many managers are beginning to realize what a significant impact they can have on the business of their companies.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the lavishing of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty about whether revolutionary changes will eventually occur or not.
"But they now have only a few weeks left to make the transition to a new right for their companies without complications," said Jan Spáčil, partner of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively engaged in the new codes, 26 percent said their firms had already taken all necessary measures to be prepared in a timely manner.
Furthermore, 35 percent of the companies of this number are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, one in five companies has not yet dealt with recodifications, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Just eight percent of companies admit that they have not yet addressed matters related to recodifications.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent) for the largest number of companies interviewed, followed by a solution to the terms and conditions (16 percent) and changes in the Land Registry and in liability for damage (after ten percent).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important innovations of the whole recodification will take place, namely the unification of the regulation of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will expire, as a result of which the contract law should become clearer for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many innovations with an emphasis on greater freedom of organization of relationships," said Lukáš Poddán, attorney at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In connection with the Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
Furthermore, the topics related to changes in the convening and the course of the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent) follow.
The new legislation means a tightening of obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially when companies are at risk of bankruptcy or getting into it.
"In practice, this means that if the board members and the executives of the companies do not act with the care of a proper manager and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit earned for the performance of the office for the last two years," Spáčil added.
NSA revelations increase social paranoia by state surveillance
One peaceful day towards the end of August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the U.S. consular post in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the behest of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the purpose of the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the American forward patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV office hoped to be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and the event triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, insisted in September that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies, thus strengthening their international competitiveness or increasing their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who has become an informant from an associate, has begun revealing his valuable collection of classified surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading businessmen no longer know if they should trust the director's words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was conducting spying at a Brazilian oil company and gaining access to data with which U.S. cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, were provided, general paranoia of state surveillance of new dimensions.
The latest straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been wiretapped for perhaps a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then even leading entrepreneurs are certainly a potential target.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies more transparent.
I would say that it is possible that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released in July by the EY consultancy, German companies are convinced that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the U.S. now poses as much of a risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in the entire documentation revealed by Mr. Snowden that the United States has handed over the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concerns that the EU lacks certain capabilities in IT and the Internet, and said it should seek to reduce its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical of this.
There are voices from the German parliament that we should make a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking to some companies who have so far believed that China is the biggest threat of surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European officials have become aware to a wider extent that data stored in the U.S. falls under local jurisdiction and is therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a cloud-based U.S.-based provider after U.S. Prism was revealed on data mining.
Jim Snabe, one of the CEOs of SAP, says: "We have a new question for customers who weren't here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high-profile officials argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most precious secrets, and that data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is no surprise.
It was always happening.
“This has been a crucial issue for many years and has not changed significantly even during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of agrochemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us on a trade and industrial level, just as we do espionage on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate leaders generally do not want to boast much about the countermeasures they have made in order not to give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been reminded that taking a free memory USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi's board of directors, says that it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BfV Authority advises executives to consider whether not to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk that smartphones can be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, there is concern that SMEs will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access,” BfV said in a statement.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington post, National Intelligence Estimate's documents said France in February, alongside Russia and Israel, in the second row of perpetrators involved in hacking activity for economic intelligence, just behind China.
A member of the council in a German risk-free society concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France's internal news agency, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are conducting espionage on their allies."
New nicotine vaccine may take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before the human trials, more tests need to be carried out, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first indications are good.
“We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all methods available in the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is so strong to overcome all current approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies chase all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
During the tests of the vaccinated mouse, to which nicotine was subsequently supplied, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that were not vaccinated “calmed down,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given so often to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower because they turn liver cells into factories to make antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for people, they could be given to children before they feel like trying a cigarette, and this would prevent nicotine addiction.
However, it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to stop.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of that habit," he said.
British scientists have said the results were interesting, but cautioned that further research was needed.
A desperate cry from Obama's constituent
I voted for Obama twice – I shared hopes of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have thwarted the Republican Party's obstruction
Obstructionist policy cannot excuse the hardships of the Obama health care website or drone strikes
The 2008 Obama campaign's memoir is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard for the second year running.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would encourage me during the grim days of my second year at medical school and restore a little hope in me.
It's called "The Audacy to Win" and is a memory of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish the patient's assessments in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people and the speeches have taken your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelming superiority, and television news forced us to reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents kept the newspaper they could get.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
During the 2008 office, Obama had 82 percent support.
And here I'm closing the book.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I threw my first ballot, there were indeed changes.
It was definitely nothing I had imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse achievements – from the law on available care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of politics “not to ask anything, not to say anything” to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructions have reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the possibility of the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantánamo.
But after many situations where I have defended the Obama administration in front of colleagues and friends, I have reached the absolute limit when it comes to the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The obstructions of Republicans cannot explain consent to eavesdropping on foreign leaders or with drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained by the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans, nor that it persecutes those who reveal the wrong conduct of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without a proper trial, or for curtailing public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of a report that White House efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, they cannot excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the Act on the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if something like this was to be expected.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government power could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected office clearly has no predictable course, and our public talks will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events like the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above appear to a large extent to be the result of the administration’s own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unsorted alternative, and he seemed unable to consolidate his politics or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we had once heard of.
Still, the return to 2008 – as Obama’s support fell below 45% this week – is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the series of promises that have gone away.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat to Clinton during the Pennsylvania primaries.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back on pace and remain true to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The thoughts expressed in this commentary are exclusively opinions of Nathaniel Morris.

Syria destroys its means for chemical weapons production, says surveillance body
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the Committee on Global Chemical Weapons Supervision said Thursday, while fierce conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where poisonous substances are believed to be stored.
On Thursday, a Syrian activist group also said that more than 120 000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before November 1,
the term by that organization, based in The Hague, has established Damascus to destroy or prevent the operation of all chemical weapons equipment and machinery for the mixing of chemicals in order to create poisonous gas and fill the ammunition.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is a major milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons including yperite and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts refer to as the headquarters of both the chemical weapons and storage plant, the British-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory said.
A group of activists who monitored the total death toll through a network of activists in Syria said Thursday that 120 296 people had died.
Of these, 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children, are expected to be civilians.
On the government side, 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar al-Assad, 18 678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
There are also 2,202 government defectors and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters among those killed, many of whom are foreigners.
Day 25. In July, the United Nations estimated that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million residents to leave the country.
Assad's forces have fought in Saphera against the rebels, many of whom are linked to Al Qaeda, for weeks.
The observer said Thursday that the losses were on both sides but did not have specific numbers.
The fighting has underlined the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors who, in their mission to rid Syria of chemical arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war, must deal with close deadlines.
In a statement from the OPCW, which is working closely with the UN, it was said that his team was now "satisfied that he had verified - and monitored the destruction - of Syria's declared essential equipment for production and mixing/fulfillment."
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two locations because of safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were "abandoned, according to Syria, and ... the items of the chemical weapons program it contained were moved to two other declared sites that had been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW executive committee next month.
"I bow to the courage and bravery you have shown in completing this most challenging mission that this organization has ever had," observer director Ahmet Uzumcu said in a commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in his third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government, with their security forces full of members of the Alawite sect, offshoot of Shia Islam, are facing each other in a civil war.
In terms of further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said there was a powerful explosion on Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Lazikiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says pipelines in Bulgaria launch new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's biggest energy projects, Gazprom's director said.
"Today we are witnessing a landmark: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia's gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" eliminated.
Once the entire project starts operations in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is due to begin in other countries in the direction of the flow at the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Early Puberty: Mature Previously
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It is not proven that there are hormones or other chemicals behind this
Experts say one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an obesity epidemic.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so evident in boys.
CNN's former correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
Should the mother be horrified when her daughter's breasts start growing and her hair hair grows on shame at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatric Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I've spent a lot of time making sure my parents are that it's usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, hair on the bend and armpits and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
However, in the last forty years there has been only a small shift in the age when the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 in 1970.
“When the breasts start to develop, at least two to three years pass before the first menstruation takes place,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem”
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It discusses what activates the true start of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered “premature.”
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which can be closely monitored by pediatric doctors.
Faster growth can be a reason for an endocrinologist to conduct tests to eliminate serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of bones, which can eventually lead to a halt to growth and dwarfism in adulthood.
Recommendations on medications and hormonal treatments depend on the child's age, speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to the deployment of drugs, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that “the suppression of puberty can alleviate the problems with the girl’s behavior and her feelings that she is different from her peers.”
Understandable is another big problem: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have their period.
"They're worried that he can get pregnant, or how he's going to handle hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began her period at the age of 10.
Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation, it was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or a sexual message in the media are to blame.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason is an obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he assisted with the conduct of a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9, which combines body fat with the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American women and Hispanics tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climates to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys already have facial hair and shame at a young age, the trend towards the full flourishing of early puberty is not as clear as it is in girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) conference have added additional complexity to the subject.
Acne and hair of the shame is common even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful when it comes to how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their child's doctor on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to your child sooner than you'd expect," Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who develop earlier need assurance that even when this happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of militants to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
Lebanon's Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the mountainous Kalamun region.
According to the still-clarified reports, Israel destroyed the missiles destined for Hezbollah during Wednesday's airstrikes on two sites in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the local army.
Its agenda is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of armaments to the hands of Hezbollah to Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday's Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria are yet to be refined.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but was confirmed by U.S. sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snoubar Jabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya news station says two warehouses were hit, in which the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, it was missiles of Russian production SA-8.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Jesse said Syria is continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with rockets, and the Syrian air force is teaching members of the armed section of Hezbollah to handle missiles.
The SA-8 are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are located on a moving chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, due to mobility and small dimensions, they can be easily hidden.
They are equipped with radar, but after firing the missile, it is difficult to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
He says he is helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community to which the Alawites belong.
Now, reportedly, 15 000 of his fighters are ready to help conquer the army back Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalamoon lies between Damascus and the country's third largest city, Homs.
The battle is supposed to be retaliation for the opposition's recent attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade of Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army win back the city of Kusair near the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the Kusair rebels have just left for Kalamoun.
It says Maliki has a major role in the recovery of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be partly part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Sobotka negotiates for the CSSD.
Social democracy is crumbling, the people's and the Babišs are talking to each other and preparing a common course of action.
If the Social Democrats conceive within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly played partners who will put a ready-made list of demands on the table, including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD envoys will then either swallow the sour coalition grapes or nod to the fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka first encountered after four days of being carried on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political committee and, most importantly, to force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party is only him, the other members of the team will be allowed only after a key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I have apologized to the members of the committee and now to the citizens.
It is not to be lied, in personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hašek said after the meeting of the Social Democrat leadership.
He added that he was not clinging to the post of first vice-president.
"I will communicate my decision on November 10 at the ÚVV," Hašek said.
Zdeněk Škromach, the vice-chairman of the ČSSD and the head of the parliamentary group, Jerome Tejc, spoke similarly.
He said he was elected just two days ago.
Both MPs then declared that they would do everything possible to make the fifty-member ČSSD club sound one voice.
Michal Hašek gave the absurd theatre a sentence: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decision of the party authorities."
Another lie live.
Or did he forget, in the call for Sobotka’s resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, that the August ÚVV decided with 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka was the candidate of the party for prime minister?
However, the head of the ČSSD, by convening the ÚVV until next Sunday, produced a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of 192 members of this body and the media with a bunch of gossip and rumors, eventually reminding the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
He will be fighting dirty laundry powerfully, there will be hints of dark alliances between the coal baron Zdeněk Bakala and Sobotka's wing.
The friendship of Bohuslav Sobotka and influential lawyer Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
The disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the ČSSD will bubble up.
The words of the mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka's ally Petr Kajnar are warning: "I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots."
If the ÚVV had met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
The traitors sprinkle their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning head of the ČSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
UN celebrates new goals of fighting poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work without delay on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pursuing "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said overnight at the summit that now is the time to "rise above national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to establish a general Sustainable Development Goal - the SDG," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDG.
Babiš: The government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in opposition and that it will have to go straight to the government in order to create one at all.
The president of YES admitted this in an interview with Právo, which will be published tomorrow.
Putin vows environmental Olympics, plan to be hacked by giant secret landfills
Winter sports fans are already cutting the meter until the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are looking at their preparation with increasing fears.
The Russian Olympics, although not starting until February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians do not appear to be able to fulfill the promise that the preparations and holding of the Games will not in the slightest disrupt nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high bar, and the Canadian Games were the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
However, Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to hold games with "zero waste" appears to have taken hold long ago.
Last week, reporters discovered a giant dump of building material in the village of Achstyr near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of building material, tires, canisters and insulation foams was found by environmentalists in August, which they immediately reported.
Russian authorities have disappeared with the rocks and the landfill.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters saw a landfill the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one that several sites have been created in the area, the British newspaper The Times reported.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly that builds a roughly sixty-kilometre journey between Sochi Airport and a sports resort, is working on the site.
The business, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways defended themselves that the landfill was set up by one of the subcontractors.
The locals are already desperate.
According to residents of Achshtyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village for three months now and day.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymta, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here is contaminating the Soča water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," Vladimir Kimayev of the environmental non-profit EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizing committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
By comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51bn, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics came to 43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost just 19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and fears about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working on the exhibition of sports venues and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth in protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also worried about how Russian organizers are dealing with a new law during the Games that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are preparing to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
The rules on the use of electronic devices on the aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will still have to shut down their tablets and smartphones while starting and landing, regardless of changes in the U.S. to ease regulations on those devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies room to change their procedures, so that passengers will be able to read electronic books, watch videos, or play games during critical phases of the flight if devices remain in "air" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a lot of work from U.S. carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices at critical stages of flight are still in effect in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices on the aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they obtain from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its on-board wi-fi entertainment system, has been inclined to change but has announced that it will submit to a regulatory authority decision.
"We would welcome CASA to conduct an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices because we really think that now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment) it would improve the customer experience," the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced it will stick to current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention of changing that anytime soon," he said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory field, which can be useful for our passengers, and we will certainly thoroughly study the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of air carriers from the U.S., the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their air park.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training material, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
"Once the airline confirms its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will order passengers to shut down during the landing of the device.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stored under the seats or in storage space above their heads during take-off and descent.
There are nonsense in the film Gravity, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from the Universe of Gravity sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic some time after the premiere.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by almost 150 thousand viewers and earned more than 26 million crowns.
Most reviews rate the image positively.
However, there are some inconsistencies in it.
News server Lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity, not to mention, even if it appears to be a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice, for example, the hair of Sandra Bullock, which somehow does not float in a state of weightlessness.
The Hubb Space Telescope and the International Space Station move along significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistic effect and the whole behavior of the fire in a state of weightlessness.
The suits would not last such wounds either.
The heroes in the film Gravity often get into a collision with different objects, and the suits without much trouble all last.
Neither plot plot was spared the criticism.
Such a large-scale tragedy in Earth's orbit is unrealistic, according to some discussants.
Plus, she wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People argue in forums about the "unreal" behavior of ropes.
It seems to be intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Observatory and Planetarium of the City of M. Prague): I have only seen it on a wide screen so far, but I can definitely say, I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, it was science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost a duty) not to stick to a consistent reality.
"More than the inconsistencies mentioned by you, I was touched by the three times shown by the space station with the degrading level of technology (last Chinese)."
"The Chinese will be at the end of the decade and will probably look better than it is in the film."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors do not successfully try to violate the laws of physics, and so the natural-oriented viewer will appreciate that during various cosmic collisions and collisions, the momentum of momentum, in the dictionary of physics, is also a very realistic view of the Earth from space, including the thin shell of the atmosphere and the aurora.
There will certainly be inconsistencies in a more detailed examination.
In addition, for example, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic debris in orbit appears in some scenes to appear in reverse than it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things the filmmakers adapted to their needs, but I did not record any fundamental and heaven calling offense against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus, it can be seen that the creators took care of the credibility of the displayed events.
From moments that make no sense, it is worth naming the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in an otherwise inclined orbit than the ISS.
The result is a vastly different mutual speed and the rescue operation would not actually be able to take place as it was shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of the department of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the whole ISS would rotate, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, who forces both actors to let go when they are no longer moving towards each other.
Bombardier's profits plummeted as a result of a drop in supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, which is due to fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Based in Montreal, Bombardier also did not release any aerial test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information on whether the aircraft would comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the opening test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not meet estimates and shares on the Toronto stock exchange fell 8 percent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded his rating from "higher profitability" to "performance of the sector" on Thursday, with the expectation that the stock exchange would experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While we were mostly expecting smaller aircraft deliveries, the profit margin in the field of transport disappointed us significantly," Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we anticipate that market skepticism will increase relative to this program.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will fight their way into the lower market area now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and after several months of delays, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177 as potential buyers wait for the results of the test flight to verify the company's claims regarding the low consumption and savings on the airline's cargo.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin expected that when the first aircraft was put into commercial use, Bombardier would achieve its target of 300 binding orders.
The executives also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that examinations on the ground and software updates were scheduled during the plane's shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and that's what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test planes should take off in the coming weeks and the others not long after.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it has evaluated its plan to commission the aircraft and will provide updated information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight tests – despite being in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From US$172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to US$147 million in the third quarter ending on September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover has fallen marginally from US$4.2 billion to US$4.1 billion.
According to Thomson's IBES system, analysts had expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered just 45 aircraft during the quarter compared to 57 aircraft a year before.
Clean orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of September 30, which does not change even as of December 31.
"The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low order intake and overall market condition disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
Yield in the aerospace industry fell 13 percent to US$2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said the revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to US$2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts accounted for 32.6 billion as of 30 September, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Executives said new outlooks would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent during trading Thursday afternoon to US$4.83.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft maker and Bombardier's closest competitor, announced a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Mick Jagger says he certainly didn't leave after then-18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview with an Australian radio show, the pop star said this week that she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old habits die hard."
Perry said when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran, and he drove up to her.
She added: "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me."
In a statement from Thursday, Jagger's (70) representative said he categorically rejected Katy Perry's ever making proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confusing it with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers (singers) who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album, "Prism," debuted in the first place this week.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"This is a scary message and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspapers said, considering the bill unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be prejudiced because it is the government's extended hand" and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies," he said.
According to Star, the bill effectively hands the government over “complete control of the media,” and the Standard newspaper reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have “suffered a hard blow,” and criticize the bill as “strict.”
The approval of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by an Islamic gunman in a Westgate shopping centre.
The anger of the authorities was turned on by Kenyan media when it broadcast security camera footage on which soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looted a luxury goods store.
The police director responded by summoning two journalists and a head of media personnel for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shills and individual journalists up to one million along with the risk of "decommissioning" or denied official journalistic accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to seize the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to destroy most radio stations.”
It is also reported that these measures can have a liquidating impact on what is called the Kenyan "live blogosphere."
Politicians know that when they silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to repeal cuts ordered by the national pay agency and to restore their fat salaries of around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, making them among the tallest in the world.
As a result of the tax on owners of foreign real estate, the London bubble is bursting
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the tax on the proceeds of financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget presented a fee of 7 per cent for the transfer of real estate for buildings in the price above 2 million pounds and annual fees for buyers who own properties within the company, not as individuals.
The proceeds from the property transfer fee in housing stock in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which reached 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceed the total for North Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "Given the increase in the transfer of real estate in homes of high value and the introduction of related legislation designed to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value assets are under-taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system."
He added that “this may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London or that existing owners are reluctant to sell.”
The leading properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in a rich belt that extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, saw a record 11.8% increase over the past year.
Prices in central London continue to show steady growth of 5.6% from year to year, but were overshadowed by a booming "home market" in which, according to a survey by real estate agency Savills, they experienced southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) increase.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys moved a concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with inflammation of the larynx.
The Sheffield group was due to perform Friday at the Hydro city complex.
Alex Turner's lead singer's illness, however, forced her to move the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to postpone today's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and on the basis of a medical recommendation, the Arctic Monkeys Group must also postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow planned for Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with inflammation of the larynx and unfortunately he won't be able to get out."
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and perform at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
