Economia and the Center connect management.
For example, they will offer joint advertising
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Karlín, Prague.
Economia has taken another step towards transforming Centrum holding into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and the Centre have had a common top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union is essential for the integration of both publishing houses into the joint media house," comments Kamil Čermák, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Economie and authorized CEO of Kamil Čermák.
Čermák, who will be at the head of unified management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of Centrum Holdings Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Voparil was appointed the new joint director of the business, to whom the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Tylčerová, is also subordinate.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of the editors is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team also includes the director for transformation Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pittsová was tasked with the newly established position of Marketing Director.
The independent corporate communication department is now managed by Věra Lhotská.
The joint CFO is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the content of all published titles and, last but not least, to further significantly streamline the business management of the company," Čermák added.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, has concluded a contract for the purchase of Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of news servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or the portfolio of almost two dozen other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, the news server IHNED.cz, weeklies Respekt and Ekonom and the number of printed and Internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
Citing an unnamed U.S. government official, this was reported by CNN.
The Israeli press reported widely on the explosion in the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack on it.
A spokeswoman for the Israeli military, when asked by CNN, declined to comment on the airstrike.
"We are not commenting on the reports of foreign media," she said.
According to the US government source, the target of the Israeli airstrike was rockets and related equipment that, in the opinion of the Israelis, could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP reported, citing another U.S. security official, that the target of an Israeli airstrike on the target on Syrian territory was Russian SA-125 missiles.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area, however, showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they are said to have seen a battery of SA-3 missiles, including a command center with radar to track missiles and their targets.
The recorded missiles, according to a report by Israeli television, are 35 kilometers long and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed to have affected any supply of weapons for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist groups.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that a return is unlikely.
In an overnight interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic politics.
Since June 2007, when he resigned after a decade in a leading position, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks on British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an envoy of the Blion Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his answer to the London newspaper Evening Standard quoted as follows: "Yes, of course, but it's probably hard to happen, right, so..."
Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport for shooting
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of this, allegedly a terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media, reports that law enforcement officers shot dead an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, reported that there had been a shootout in which two to three members of the Transport Security Administration were injured.
How many people were injured in total and whether there are any casualties but it is still not clear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more injuries.
Berdych and Stepanek will be complemented by Rosol and Hájek
At the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrátil was nominated by Tomáš Berdych, Radek Stepanek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they go to the field of the opponent to the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in the last five years.
"We're seeing we're going on hot ground, that it's going to be wild and we have to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with only one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Stepanek, the creator of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Brno observatory will take visitors to space in a new digital series
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can sink into new comfortable seats and above their heads added a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
In order for the image to be perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the whole device is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"There are twenty-one computers that generate an image," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno observatory.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a comprehensive impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than in conventional personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician from the observatory.
The digital is able to conjure up an exceptionally realistic and plastic model of the night sky, human body or the bottom of the ocean.
Viewers find themselves right in the middle of a human universe or brain.
Another similar device is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to screen the purchased programmes and its own work in the hall.
There have been two shows on the agenda since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is designed for adults.
People learn about astronaut training, fly into space, turn to centrifuges, and then see how difficult astronauts face the cosmos.
The second show is for children and is called The Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colourful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment a nearby volcano exploded.
The entire digitium cost about fifty million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory contributed smaller amounts from its budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest swallowed audiovisual equipment and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to Director Dušek, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could come by the end of the year.
Supreme Court backs Obama's Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By the ratio of the 5:4 vote, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection Act and the available care – which mandates citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise they face the risk of paying a fine – does not contradict the Constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
The president of the court, John Roberts, stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the remaining parts of the law on 2700 pages and further ruled that the statutory requirement for health care, which requires states to expand the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise there is a risk of the loss of all financing of sickness insurance from federal sources, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
The action for the purpose of blocking this law was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the 2012 primaries, the law strongly rejected each of the major Republican candidates, including the presumed proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
Naďa Konvalinkova in the role of pub.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Nadia Konvaliinkova (62) appeared behind the tap in the role of pub and she was very good at it.
Perhaps a popular Czech actress planned a change of profession and started to do business in a pub?
Nadia Konvaliinkova appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and made a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and I was good at it.
My boss even offered to keep me busy and I could make a living making a beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stay with what I still do today, at acting," said Konvaliinková, who was a guest on the twentieth anniversary of the operation of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskeys here and there," the actress revealed.
Nadi a long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I am dead and in my current new life I must not be devoured.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I try to follow that," the actor added.
Egypt puts in office of the first free-empty president
Muhammad Morsi took an inaugural oath, but his triumphant day will hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISA Muhammad Morsi promised "new Egypt" when he was inaugurated as the first freely elected president of the country, after Hosni Mubarak, who was cast 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He sworn an oath of 18 judges dressed in black robes in a mantime house built with a view of the Nile, which is reminiscent of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and the second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer in the U.S. and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by individual governments for most 84 years since its inception.
When Morsi arrived in a small column of cars shortly after 11 a.m. locals, police officers and police officers guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pomp on Mubarah's period, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the column could pass through the usually busy route connecting the city center with suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, ridiculed as the uncharassatic “reserve tire” of the Muslim Brotherhood, has risen sharply since his victory and his speech on Friday, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate for the Islamists, but also of all those who want to bring to the end of the rebellion towards the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Morsi, dressed in a blue formal suit with a red tie to judges in a wood-panelled chamber where he sworn.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was due to give an inauguration speech.
While he was at attention, he received an official welcome from a military band that played the national anthem.
Military commander of Field Marshal Hussein Tantavia was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the chanting of the “army and the people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a secular education center and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath of Tahrir Square on Friday, at the place where the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian government last year was born, and solemnly vowed to re-grate the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took them from the exiled leader.
But by agreeing to the taking of the official oath before the court, rather than before the parliament, as is customary, he has subsided to the will of the army, suggesting that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Anyone who really wants to get to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk through a nazičany center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than the ludekr would reveal.
Many people "read from the graves".
Slowly wandering the cemeteries and gaining intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities are, what beliefs they are, how great and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their degrees and professions have been to them.
How they express their social status, what taste they have.
And from the state of the graves, he will also find out how the survivors take care of their dead.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up late and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a scrounger.
For two years, there was no candy in my apartment, and this year it will probably be no different.
However, statistics show that I am, in terms of Halloween, black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), this year, most Americans will celebrate Halloween -- in fact 158 million -- and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and ornaments.
What I always look forward to on Halloween are trendy.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion will go to costumes.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are the last fad of fashion.
Sexy doesn’t have to be just women anymore; they can be sexy even meals like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As for men, I expect we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to the parade of the dead, and I bet the spacemen from Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my amazement we were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million this year on animal pet costumes.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, the Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's roughly 300 million kg Hershey tables, lollipops, sweets Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark sticks.
This is amazing news for 41 million trick-or-treaters who are about to raid our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe believe and consume, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candies, and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association, almost 16 thousand tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never broken.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls," which is, by the way, the real prison) "Howl-O-Scream" (shoe, roar) and "The house of shock).
In fact, there are officially dedicated 1200 haunted homes in the United States that, according to American Haunted Houses, have a profit of $500 million, and that includes those amazing photos of you wet fears and that your friend puts on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like will take a photo and credit a comment as "you look at it."
Finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
Even when we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to a big pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we’ve been doing it since we were little.
Luckily for us, the trend of “baby in pumpkin” started thanks to the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up on the fact that we carved the gourd instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Office, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkin.
A pumpkin lantern with a shimmering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245 thousand tons of pumpkins grew up this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon of Napa, California, and try cutting up their pumpkin weighing nearly one ton.
How Thai insects picked up the Paris bar sales
You may be sneering over insects and you have no idea that you eat it voluntarily about half a kilogram a year.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nutritious, and you also have a unique experience taken care of.
The offer of insects was the first in Paris to be the menu of his business at the beginning of October, Elie Daviron, a cook and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, which was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, you would find in the fashionable 18th arrondissement near Montmartre widely visited by tourists.
With fresh avocados, baked red peppers, Ginger and quail egg, guests can now bite not only various larvae, locusts or water beetles, you can also taste scorpions.
Carefully and specially packed vans (so that the insects do not damage the wings, do not twist their legs or damage their eyes) they send the Davirons all the way from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it's common elsewhere.
The owner of a Parisian bar with a pioneering menu lists several reasons to consume insects.
The first is the environmental benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
"Moreover, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes pleasure, a sense of sin and an atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just conveying a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be thrilled by the idea of how to consume a beetle decorated with pesto, but the reaction of the customers of the Paris bar to served insects are very positive, according to the owner.
Even the skeptics are said to eventually taste, even if they start with the smallest bites and finally choose scorpions.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing your hands will ALSO change your MIND.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an insoluble task.
Of course, both failed.
But the group, which washed its hands after failure, made a much more optimistic impression than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "with washed hands" performed better in the next test than the other.
Yet those who washed their hands, in other tests achieved worse results than those who did not have them washed.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not record any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical purity removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, the motivation is declining, the testers have to concentrate much more in the next exams.
If we passed the results of the research to the Czechs, probably the most optimistic we would be after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs do not wash their hands, but it is already a fifth after the city transport.
Hygiene usually also sticks after work in the garden or in the workshop, when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
The pet's caress is motivated to wash 78.7 percent of people.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after shaking hands with a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that the two nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Hew it would be appropriate, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," said Klaudie Komárková, a skin doctor.
A tunnel for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico, has been discovered, supplemented by self-lighting, ventilation and electric rail.
U.S. authorities described a tunnel roughly one-half-meter magnitude as one of the most sophisticated secret corridors they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which winds to the length of almost six football pitches, connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego in the U.S.
This area is full of vague warehouses, where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be unnoticed.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also intercepted eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
If convicted, he faces prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison.
In the city of Nogales in Arizona, smugglers penetrate into vast drainage channels.
The tunnel has been the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which puts a problem in front of drug cartels on how to get its product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor of about 650 meters equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuan to two warehouses in San Diego.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define what changes in relation to the EU want to see by British business and job-creating companies.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we asked leading British businessmen about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov asked 1 000 leading entrepreneurs representing British businesses of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government prefer new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in a long and strenuous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When we asked their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels’ regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area – even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies, agreed.
Finally, our survey by business leaders revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to strive for a change in the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings with which businesses of different sizes and core business groups have identified is that the business sector is pushing for a “meaningful change” that will bring back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake – reaching a treaty change and a better deal for Britain can mean a gain of up to 16% in a referendum in the EU referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of Britain's EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to be a significant shift from the current balance of forces back towards Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and given the way the eurozone is embarking on a journey to a narrower economic and fiscal union, and increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority, and as the results of our survey show, for business, this means a re-focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.

The British government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as the first phases start in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "join the UK together."
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was "enhanced" by collaborating with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After completing Phase Two, the line from Manchester to Leeds will lead.
In June, the government reconsidered the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted talks with the national transport office Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 to identify additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that will better connect the UK and its cities.”
We gave SH2 the green light because the benefit that will bring it is huge.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also a connection – across the UK, thanks to HS2, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected.
Scottish Minister Alisair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to “clearly” support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed line has the potential to bring immense economic benefits to Scotland, but it also delivers economic importance to Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain."
So we are enthusiasticly working with the British government to explore the possibilities of bringing a high-speed rail to Scotland and bringing benefits to everyone and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British ministers over the next year, and to jointly deciding on the next steps.
Frontier Airlines prepares to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to $100 on its flights for the storage of hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 per coffee or soda, although in their announcement on Wednesday they said passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new hand luggage fee covers luggage in the upper storage compartment, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers with payment will wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the hundred-dollar fee is intended to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to collect this fee," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second bags in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees and stuffed in the hand luggage hidden in the storage compartment as much as they could, so that space was often lacking in this space.
Fees are one of the ways to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said the point of this new fee really isn't to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier gate can bring luggage for which they will not pay anything, while the other passenger queues for the same luggage pays $100.
O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be modified to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier's new fee for hand luggage will not be valid until the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street perceive an additional baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses.
Most of them did not reach for hand luggage charges.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-car car company, Allegiant Air, later followed.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungary's Wizz Air, says air transport advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage fee would deliver $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers met Spirit's unusual fee for hand luggage.
"Arriving a plane was the smoothest I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.
I was expecting to see a gnashing of teeth and quarrels at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the onset took place in an instant."
Frontier, also, following the model of Spirit, will apply the fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier said passengers who get lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be replenished free of charge.
Water will continue to be served for free.
In 2008, US Airways briefly attempted to introduce beverage charges, but after complaints from passengers, it withdrew from which seven months later, and no other major airline mimited it.
Frontier's latest move to charge for hand luggage if passengers do not purchase a flight directly from this airline is its last effort to direct customers directly to their website.
Airlines pay online travel retailers such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of doing it through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, she began giving only half a million to customers who had purchased through an online travel agency as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cropped a reward for a mile-fly to 25 percent of the trip.
So the journey with Frontier 1000 miles long purchased through an online travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and losing money.
According to financial results presented on Wednesday, corporate partner Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9 percent, and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
By selling this airline, Republic is also trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
We have studied 11 THOUSAND AD ADS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11 thousand job advertisements, of which 4300 were published in the daily newspaper and 6800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is therefore the most important medium for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was first conducted, it was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it has settled at about 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertising of job opportunities significantly reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example is a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in times of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25 900 ads were published in the same period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented to a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including workers’, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína Št'astnová.
The rate of representation of selected professional groups varies from both media.
On the Internet, advertisements looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts have taken the lead.
The position of programmers or leading small businesses was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, the large representation belongs mainly to service and workers' professions.
The most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through an advertising offer include, of course, education.
Other monitored areas included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was given in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only in two percent of advertisements, employers demanded an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The demands of 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of ads (in daily press in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Experience in the industry was required in 54% of advertisements.
The requirements for practice are mostly associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other executives.
In the part of workers’ professions, these are mainly mechanics and repairmen or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical equipment, added the author of the study Jiří Tillner.
Employers also state in half of their advertisements the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential applicants.
As the most frequently required skills, communication skills have been appearing in the first place in the first place.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, responsibility, organisational skills and reliability.
One-fifth of shopping malls are struggling with low traffic
This is according to data from real estate consulting firms Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague's Bohnice, the Krakow Shopping Centre opens to the public, it will be the 19th Prague shopping center.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
The unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large center towards the site and poor layouts, i.e. too many floors or a complicated and confusing arrangement of passages, or dead places of centers," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of retail real estate, Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of shopping centers are struggling with low traffic.
The main reasons include, among other things. poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or oversaturation of the market in a given place.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centers need to try harder to 'attract' their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
According to Soták, the operability of shopping centers is generally stable, even rising at some centers, because landlords were willing to discount rents in the crisis and rent some units.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened that are not fully occupied and the average occupancy is thus decreasing (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
Shopping centers opened in the past two years have been very slow to promote the market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a place in the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room in the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centers', focused on shopping and services of daily supplies for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
According to Soták, there is also a place for other shopping centers on the domestic market.
Both for small 'service' centers and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or enlargement in regional cities.
"Countries such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, he sees the space for the upcoming shopping center on Vítězné náměstí, according to him, they have a clear potential of Na Příkopě and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is developing intensively, which allows traders to cover and expand to smaller cities at favorable rent and operating costs, the space is also in some locations for smaller local or housing shopping centers, respectively their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková of DTZ.
In the Czech Republic, there are currently 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leasable space.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Parents of underage Georgia boy who died in strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of an underage-inguial boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a rolled wrestling spirit in the gymnasium of his high school, believes their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11, slapped in a straight line behind the grandstands in the gym of high school where he went.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died accidentally, but the family of a seventeen-year-old woman refuses to do so.
"They are unequivocally convinced that their son was murdered," lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the same as the sheriff said.
"They are convinced that this contradicts logic, the laws of physics, and also common sense," Crump said.
They think it should cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back in a bag of corpses," he said.
State prosecutor Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that a few key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
declared Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll watch the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a routine investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy suggested Johnson had died as a result of "positional suffocation."
The second autopsy, however, according to Moore, reported another cause of death.
"There are a few questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers enough evidence in the Johnson death case to investigate a crime or civil rights investigation, he would ask the FBI and carry it out.
A representative of the Sheriff's office from the Lowndes district was not immediately available for any comment on Thursday.
A judge from southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to make available all the videos from surveillance cameras that investigators had viewed.
The adolescents hope the video footage will include a clue leading to an exposing their son to die.
Report: Obama's campaign considering swapped Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser was secretly plotting to replace Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times magazine obtained a copy of the coming book and announced on Thursday evening that the president's top collaborators had held intense group meetings and polls in late 2011 to gauge whether to get rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes of re-election.
According to the National-political correspondent for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and at the White House, namely the former White House chief of staff, Bill Daley, to measure the effect of moving former Secretary of State Clinton to the post of vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Just a few of the president's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was a representative of the efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the nominee would not increase "Obama's chances substantially."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration really considered replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've been researching a lot of things intensively, and this was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
You mustn't forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we were like, "Kristepan, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "proper care," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the campaign for re-election had made considerable investments to see if this move would pay off in the election.
“The campaigns don’t have that kind of choice and qualitative research unless something is really seriously considered,” Martin said on AC360.
But it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then boss knew about this potential shuffle of the cards.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was "acquawn" the potential change, the former office manager admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" does not answer the question of whether the political probe has reached the table for Obama.
Cooper asked Martin if he was serious about Obama not knowing about research on the removal of Biden from the candidate.
"Maybe," Martin said.
Oh, no, Mr. Haska.
We have a unique opportunity to say to politicians that not.
It is necessary to exert such pressure that Martin Hašek is relieved of all political functions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already so slim.
Martin Hašek is shielding himself with the promise he made, but everyone and a politician especially need to be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Confidence is the only capital a politician has (Mr. Babiš also has the material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he's resigning in politics.
Mr. Haska, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me, unless you were lying - here you see how complicated it is to lie), you leave politics yourself, like a man.
People will then accept your adology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakness whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, even a flawed person or a lifeline.
It may seem to you that it is unfair when I only address you, but you are the leader and they are just misguied sheep.
And you are a leader and always wanted to be.
I understand that now you're trying to lower your ears for a moment, regroup your strength, sit out the disgrace, and then attack again, but that's how partisans or backstamblances behave.
You, I repeat, in your eyes the leader, the alpha male, so act like that.
Accept responsibility and leave politics.
The black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying hard to find money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are starting to see the solution in a small black box that easily fits into your car's dashboard.
The devices that track every kilometre that the motorist travels and that transmits this information to the authorities is at the heart of Washington’s controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renovate an outdated system of financing U.S. major roads.
Usually the drab design of the highways suddenly stimulated the intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to be able to use these small lockers that would record mileage and possibly where you were going – and then use that information to build a tax assessment.
The tea party is horrified.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays per kilometre of the road on which he drives.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“This is not a matter of being able to choose,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the State Administration’s Association in Southern California, who plans to start tracking mileage for every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this.
The impetus is the fact that the Road Confidence Fund financed from the taxes that Americans pay at gas stations is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars drive a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by just one cent.
"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the system paying for a mileage.
"In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it the user fee according to the number of mileage.
It is no surprise that this idea appeals to urban liberals, as taxes can be used to change driver behaviour patterns, which, for example, can help reduce traffic jams and greenhouse gas generation.
California designers look up to this system in planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (represented by Pennsylvania), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free Market Leaders from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to the idea that drivers will pay for mileage.
"It's not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to go in the direction of paying per kilometre.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project, which was supposed to include about 10 000 cars.
However, the leadership of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural lawmakers representing the components of the population, whose daily life often means to travel many kilometers for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The most ardent is Oregon, which included 5 000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying tax to the state for mileage, instead of a tax on gasoline.
Nevda has already completed the pilot project.
New York is currently exploring the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in trucks.
And the coalition I-95, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept has not only a supporter.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with equipment, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
"Concerns about tracking like Big Brother and a similar issue were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project went on, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to record everyday trips and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of those few states that is trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometers the car drives, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was not originally involved in the action to help the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging law liability insurance market, where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they would drive.
But this device, which is testing, attracts the attention of the road network designers, because it does not use GPS and supplies only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using the modem.
“People will be more willing to do it if you don’t follow their speed and position,” says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with the fact that they give drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don’t have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the population of the state.
In other places, they hope that the prudent public will accept this concept if the facility knows more, no less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a taxable facility that would be equipped to additionally pay fees for parking hours to provide mileage insurance and to collect speed data from other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city's projection document said.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all the discussions about paying per kilometre are not just a huge proxy issue.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Committee in San Francisco Bay say Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by increasing the gas tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other cars that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for a radical operation when it is enough to take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the legislation and public affairs committee.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Which billionaire will you be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy the operator O2.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations and, according to various sources from agencies and behind the scenes, the hand is already up its sleeve.
The transaction announcement is expected to come in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for LTE networks, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG Group.
Under the brand Sazka Telecommunications, it started to auction frequencies for LTE networks.
And to the general surprise, until then the company's appetite to penetrate telecommunications had not been talked about.
But Sazka is now led by the very experienced telecommunications smother Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing chief of Radiomobil (today T-Mobile), then became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and last time he headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at the same time.
She signed up for the auction and now admitted that she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
Vodafone would probably not like that under normal circumstances, but according to Hospodářské noviny, it may be part of the much closer cooperation of both companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from the agreement of rival operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that may be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender for LTE networks (as a newcomer can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go into the auction at all, or it will not mind the auctioning of only limited spectrum (there is not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can share the networks with Sazka.
Vodafone will launch Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), allowing the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network, which will also be available to Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the money saved on some security of the Internet or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy the Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) he would immediately acquire a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big moth that will be restructured.
In the auction, Kellner would get the LTE network already for the O2 and very likely in cooperation with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share the networks.
The auction could finally end in success, but probably not with the high amounts enjoyed by the state budget.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calls with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists withheld in Russia since September over protest against planned oil production in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported by AFP, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
At the same time, she claims that the initial accusation of her activists from piracy has not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against an oil rig in the Arctic were transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA news agency, it was a planned move.
Authorities first charged the environmentalists with piracy, for which they faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But last week, they announced that they would replace the accusation with a more milder disorderly conduct, for which there is a risk of a lower sentence with an upper limit of seven years in prison.
Greenpeace said in a statement that the authorities have not yet withdrawn allegations of piracy, as promised.
This means that the arrests are now charged with two crimes.
The powerful Investigation Committee announced last week that it would replace the allegations of piracy by allegations of disorderly conduct.
But when the thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the accusation of piracy was not dropped.
Instead, a new charge was brought against everyone," AFP quoted a statement.
The Russians arrested three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at the Gazprom oil rig in mid-September.
Environmentalists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which was sailing under the Dutch flag.
Since then, everyone has been held in custody against which they have filed an appeal, but the court rejected them all.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of imprisonment.
Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said today that moving to St. Petersburg would make it easier for meeting with families and consular workers.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he said.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked the Dutch king Willem-Alexander for help.
In a hand-language letter published today by the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper, she called on the monarch to speak out about their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned mobster of police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) was to transmit information to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
A Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed the drug mobster about a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come out, he was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was supposed to pass on sensitive information to the underworld chief Neil Scarbrough after being suspected of using cocaine, Neil Scarbrough, to investigate his drug-saking operations.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was haemandled as the best legal counsel, was arrested in his home after the police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he represented in previous narcotics-related proceedings, in 2011 he was arrested in his home.
Police spotted Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who had just dinner with his Law Society colleagues.
Based on the tests, which found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he sought inceflicity information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were followed at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trading in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After detaining heroin and cocaine worth about £1.5m over a series of raids along with £200 000 in cash, 32 others ended up in prison.
Ditta (42) passed on information to criminals for fear of his addiction to cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works at the Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, experienced shameful moments before the Crown Court in Liverpool when, after a three-week trial, he was found guilty of defending the administration of justice in two cases.
During an earlier hearing, he pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's fall came after a Scarborough police investigation found he had been in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him posting drugs clean-range 60 percent under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough and Dritta were at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home, where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two persons.
In court, it was said that traces of the class A drug were found in his hair, his wallet and on his credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, and said he had spoken to the suspect dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation falls under "conformious communication."
During his arrest, Dittt took his wallet and tried to take out a few credit cards from it, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken.
During the police interrogation, he said he ran the office at both his home address and at the workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work matters.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented to tell them what the detectives know about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who else is more aware that they must not violate the law than a legal representative in the criminal law area."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a legal representative and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation was obstructed as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially with Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta dismissed the offense and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer to whom I am not, and I would like to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have expected 15 hours, but I would do so immediately."
After the hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta himself became a criminal from a lawyer in the criminal law area as he began to obtain drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organized crime groups, which gave him the task of collecting valuable information about the police investigation.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and inspire confidence in the public and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crimes Unit in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr. Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now for defending the administration of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring the criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is out of the hands of the law.
We'll find you and put you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of association for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five persons involved in trading were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, saying that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death block in America, as a guest at dinner, he would like Mohammed Ali and cited inequality as a motivation for work.
Obama backs away from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama backed yesterday back from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
Citing hundreds of thousands of notifications of testimonies from providers Republicans, in recent days accuses the president of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama twitched from his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In view of what he called "summer in the media" about the testimonies, Obama urged the Americans who received these announcements to search for new safeguards in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population that purchased the insurance for themselves can be forced to change the program, because their insurance does not meet the new requirements set by the Affordable Act.
"I'm saying this to these Americans straight: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in her testimony before the Washington Energy and Trade Committee.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the Internet market has been "weakly" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
The exasperated Sebelius word, which he picked up on the microphone, was pronounced yesterday towards the adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which took place after a tumultuous exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri that concerned whether she and she herself had to participate in the care program.
More than three hours during the hearing at Sebelius, he repeatedly inflicted on the question of why the "architects" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance, and did not purchase the program via HealthCare.gov, which is now imposing on millions of Americans.
Travels through the mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in Cameroon villages.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one per 5 000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates for the CNN Award Heroes of the Year 2013.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year competition, you can vote for him or any other of the ten main candidates.
The winner will receive $250 000 in order to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious and recap of going to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde.
At first he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there she created a hematoma that caused him problems all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years delivering his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the kind of treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but the first you are not.
There are many patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5 000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just by comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonian doctor could visit, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health care spending in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his compatriots suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon at a central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas over the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he has helped almost 32 000 people with his group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are packed into the vans, attaching medical supplies to the roofs and traveling through harsh terrain to villages that need help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really the reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with its broad smile and unbridled energy – is very willing to engage in local merriment.
The next day, the team begins to treat hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every quest," says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that requires a school, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team makes simple surgeries under local anaesism.
Surgeries are usually done in the school building, at the town hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make room for another patient.
With the help of a light from the generator, the operating room and the sanitary equipment of Bwelle and its volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay awake and continue to work, they're playing drums all night," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back into the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free operations last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to local residents.
One man said he would be able to work again after the hernia surgery.
"That will change our future for our family," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works for private medical clinics around Yaounde at night.
He says that this second thesis finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest are covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteers for Bwelle’s group.
He's always in a hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, this is a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We washed our hands thoroughly for Dr. Bwellem and removed blood stains or held his tools," O'Malley says.
You will never experience this as a second-year medical student in America.
Students volunteers usually pay their way to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But as soon as they arrive in Yaounde, food, transportation and study is provided by Bwelle.
"Without a doubt he's a hero," O'Malley says.
This organization gives his life, and its desire to help the inhabitants of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the constant harness is not a burden.
To help others live happier, to fulfill the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, alleviate their pain – that’s why I do it.

Central banks keep swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a constant tool to allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need.
The banks said this in their joint statement.
"This is a very sensible step," commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at London's Barclays bank.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so I do not think it is any surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market first fled.
Central banks' agreements have allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers' decision comes as the U.S. Fed is preparing to end its U.S. economy support program, which could drive the price of money in the global market even higher.
By default, the swap contract is used to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency with the current excess of the liquidity of the second currency.
It can be understood as a one-currency deposit and a loan of the currency of the other.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to return confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
The number of people infected with HIV exceeded a thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is increasing every year.
In 2002, for example, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and in 2010 there were already 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and it was a record number.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I think there is no doubt," said Miroslav Hlavatý, an expert on AIDS issues who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, last year, from January to September, there were 165 HIV patients in the country, this year there were 176.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, the most infected were in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
206 people were resident in the Central Bohemian Region.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian Region or 116 from Ústí nad Labem.
The few were infected from the Highlands, there were 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients became infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, transferred from their mother.
Children should learn myths and legends such as “models for the way of life,” says the author.
Stories of Thor can show that “gross power cannot equal clever guile,” while Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would “need to teach at school too wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too obscene,” said Crossley-Holland, who pleads for careful selection of works of age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk creations are already part of education," he said.
I defended this plan for twenty years.
He added that "openly instructing" authors and teachers are in the eye-catching stories with a "under-threshold" message for children as a "switch off."
Crossley-Holland, who translated epos Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and who also writes Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and British National Gossip, says: "You can have good intentions, but you do better if you keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children requires some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or ended with a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly determined.
The good truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
Miloslava Cejpková: The November smile
It came from the outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, what we're not used to them yet.
First she put her smile, the one she kept showing off as a defense from the wannabe friendly surroundings.
This made her very relieved, because it was a mask that she decided not to put away in public.
He was only honest at home on the days when she was granny and had her grandchildren Elinka or Adík around her.
And, of course, when her sons were on the phone.
She remembered the lesson of endless courses of business skills.
Now they were finally in handy.
So that it does not grieve its loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a dressing up on a mascara.
November, or another month, cannot do the miracle to smile really, as when they were on a trip with one that hasn't been here for almost three years.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make Cartier style evolve as a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time to lead our brand to modern things, so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains in an interview with HN his position Pierre Rainero, the director of style at Cartier.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
GM is withdrawing some new light trucks in the U.S. to repair seat backrests
According to a Friday announcement from the U.S. automotive safety authority, General Motors is withdrawing nearly 19 000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to repair the fault with manual tilting of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the front seat tilting mechanism may have a fault.
As a result, seat backrests are not in accordance with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
The announcement placed on the website of the State Traffic Safety Administration on the road (NHTSA) says that “if the car gets a hit from behind, the head restraint may not protect the passengers properly, which increases the risk of injury”.
The downloaded models were made between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the shipment in June, and for the leading U.S. automaker, it is the most important launch of the vehicle from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the van about the fault in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the announcements to owners due to the government's 16-day malfunction, which weakened growth in car sales in October.
Sales of supplies by Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Too inquisitive newspapers should be investigated
Chinese newspapers, which on the front page asked for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the administrator told the press.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made a rare public application for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribery to make up stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said the newspaper New Express will now carry out a "full correction."
The order for the "rectification" came from the State Administration for the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in the province of Guangdong.
A preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, New Express newspapers from the yangtching Evening News released several false reports about the aforementioned company Zoomlion.
"The editorial board of the New Express newspaper was disordered," the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide "buy Chen Yongzhou's administrative punishment in the form of abolishing the journalistic license."
In addition, he "administered the yangcheng group Evening News to carry out an overall correction to the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in the New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express concerning financial inconsistencies in the company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being detained, his newspapers issued two requests on the front page of his release, claiming that he was behind his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and confessed to giving false stories for a fee.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion as well as to the entire media industry and its ability to earn public confidence," he told state-run news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was a wobble of money and fame.
I realize I've been doing badly.
After an adjournment by Mr. Chen, the New Express newspaper issued an ad by the front page of an adjournment stating that he had failed when he failed to check his reports enough.
Recently, several closely watched suspects have made a confession on television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of this year's law change, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to charge themselves.
With the growing misery of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
At the Bendemeer shopping centre pawnshop in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, a ring and earrings to pay her daughter a tuition.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I gave all my money," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2400 every month as an administrator (SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, the demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – is indeed such that ValueMax, where a woman is conducting her transaction, became the third pawnbroker on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore routinely apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring a person (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And that is why, as families feel pressure over the rising cost of living and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credits supported by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and medium-sized families are turning to pawnshops to deal with a worsening financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households mainly because of increasing rents as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia due to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of the ranking with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely came out of the technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and attenuation of consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with increasing costs, people from medium to low [income scale] will try to replenish their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people's hastily halting their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewels for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped at 200 urban pawnshops are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we stop the grandmother's gold necklace and get it back next month.
The largest operator of the haulihouses shops in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen up to 20 percent increases in the number of customers using its own storage facilities in recent months.
Growth in the semi-development sector is so great that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemeer centre and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGDs it acquired on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount creditors have come under fire because of high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says that pledge offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also this does not directly increase the debt.
“Customers stop the items they already own, and the monetion of personal assets does not increase the debt of the household,” he says.
In the company, the pledge of property is increasingly accepted as a means to secure short-term, secure financing.
Among those who use pawnshops, moreover, are not just people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax affiliates when they stop gold bars or Rolex watches, and can reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from all sorts of circumstances.
“They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow in the short term because of their bold deals or investments, or small businesses that need help resolving problems in their cash flow,” says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
For the fall of the NSA website does not blame hackers, but an "internal error"
The mysterious National Security Agency said last Friday that its website fell for hours last week due to an internal error, not because of a hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov website was not open for hours this evening due to an internal error occurring during the regular update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be eliminated this evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by the DDoS attack (distributed rejection of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors noted that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the site remains unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's internal sensitive networks were "not at all" compromised.
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacker activists online claimed to be responsible for the elimination of NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood target websites with information until the servers are overloaded and the page falls.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, which once earned the nickname No Such Agency, has become the focus of public attention in recent months after a cord of revelations of foreign and domestic surveillance programs, and the target of a biting criticism, collectively, the product of the alienation of NSA secret files from the agency and their disclosure by disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of HIV infections in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the follow-up in 1986 to the end of this year's third quarter, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, there have been 2 063 infections in the Czech Republic so far.
In 396, the disease has already broken out of immunity.
198 people have died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, and five years later there were 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new infections and in 2010 then 180.
The number fell to 153 last year, but last year, on the contrary, it was a record high.
According to the laboratory, there were 212.
"In my opinion, there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," says Miroslav Hlavatý, an expert on the issue of AIDS, who for years led the Prague House of Light for Patients.
From October to the end of the year in 2011, tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors recorded 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has broken out in 161 men and 37 women.
Most infected were in Prague.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the brink of power
It is almost a rule that at the key moments of the country the head of state was not in such a form that he could fulfill his state duties.
If he was T. Masaryk physically and mentally five years younger, would have lived to see the end of his presidential term and the events around Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We probably wouldn't have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly across the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight for its legitimacy there.
And most importantly, the nation would not have a hangover from the surrender to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and he was still in good shape under Munich, but during the war it started to go downhill with him and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
To be a little better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermiite the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
They elected him, saying "the president wouldn't get into a situation of deciding."
But he had to, although it was probably not a big decision with a knife on Hitler's neck in the chancellery.
Until the last days of March 1939, Šéf intelligence, František Moravec, said what all should be done so that the occupation, which he knew exactly about the day, did not go so smoothly and with such profit.
The Senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, on the one hand, they did not believe him, on the one hand, they were afraid.
The human ruin Gottwald had his old comrades executed, as Moscow ordered.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitely prevented by the participation in normalization and had to depose him, already completely senile.
That Husák was helpless and the ill depressed old man made the events easier in November 89, but that is the only positive.
Havel was lucky that he had not been met in office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, but many of his actions suggest that thought processes are no more than what they used to be.
Well, here's what we have.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks like it and we don't know all that yet.
Fortunately, there is no threat of external threat to the republic.
Or maybe it's imminent, it's just not visible.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is not (from a historical point of view) a good thing that the president is not completely at his strength.
But it is not a normal situation.
Can't we elect a president in this country once again somely acceptable and acceptablely healthy?

Schwarzenberg: We have early elections in two years
TOP 09 Chairman Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election soon.
A week after the last one in an interview with Aktuálně.cz, he said that there is no other way out and every government emerges from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible conglomerate.
"He can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he estimates the lifespan of the beginning parliamentary term within two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly choose in a completely different way next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the chairman of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could lose voters in the next elections as this year (compared to 2010 it lost about 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that there would be early elections, it will strengthen the ANO 2011 movement Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babis will lose.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret Milan meeting of part of the party leadership, said that either he or Michal Hašek will remain in the leadership of the Social Democratic Party, Schwarzenberg comments in his own way:
"Headsy officials of the Democratic Party as little boys go to the head of state to allow them to coup in the party."
"I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I've never seen something so eagerly done in my life," added the chairman of TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (happled with in the fight for the presidency) he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to seize that party."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the Chamber of Deputies, including the Farský register of treaties, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the chairman of TOP 09 argues that such speed is due to the fact that "These laws are needed".
At the same time, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement, Martin Komárek, accused TOP 09 in the pre-election fight of the idea of "robbering" the program of the ANO movement with the idea of introducing a register of contracts.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it simply dusted off the proposal, which was already set in the second session of the House reading.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check the tip
Andy Coulson, a former editor of the News of the World (NotW), allegedly used methods of "hand-ups, surveillance and confrontation" to confirm a fraudulent tip for a love affair involving then-Norator-in-authors Charles Clarke.
State prosecutor Andrew Edis told Old Bailey in court that News of the World reported in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The papers commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and leaked into her privacy, but it was court that even Coulson called her and left her voice messages.
"The prosecutor suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now an editor of NotW, is not a man standing in front of the house hoping to catch people outside, but a person who likes to give people stories to see what they say," Edis said.
He said NotW newspapers used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the latter, watching, he must know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say, “Ofell know.”
The rumors of the love affair involving Clarke were first captured by the NotW newspaper report department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was said, “You’re wasting your time, she’s with Charles.”
A recording with voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found the records on the private investigator's computer, where Mrs Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects."
During the time Mrs Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls in which they were asked for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief rapporteur, Neville Thurlbeck and former James Weatherup reporter, oversaw Mrs Pawlby's tracking of movement.
Coulson eats 18. In June 2005, he left a voice message in which he told her: “I got a story that we are going to publish tomorrow and I would love to talk about with Charles.”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was, according to the same model as other prominent figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
It was said in court on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman while he himself was seeing his co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks have denied associates with other people to hack into phones from 3. October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to hacking into the phone.
Ben Greenman: The 10th anniversary of the New York festival comedy: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is where solo comic performances were born in America: almost a century ago, a variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling people with jokes using the interview.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York festival comedy.
The festival, founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the institution of the solo comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to play at the club," Hirsch said.
We have created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes" (set up for heroes), an annual musically comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival has expanded, the world of comedy has also spread.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival emerged from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose up with his sitcom (a cheerfully spicy "League" on a fantastic-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of the “Saturday Night live” program and “Parks and adrad” program, but she became most famous for the fast-spreading series of videos of “Marcel the shell with shoes”.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, sarcastic, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), is the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws of the festival will be the conversation: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful TV and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called “Sit down comedy with David Steinberg”.
The meeting takes place at the Town Hall in central Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedic DNA of Larry's whole job," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and himself: man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Many things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, while Chairman Štěch stirred up the unscirmuff.
Governor Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the bureau, and he confirmed it.
Chairman Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed mainly their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and legible and unusable, Vice-President Zaorálek made the most difficult interview on television.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than to propose to the vice-president of the Senate Gajdůšková as the prime minister, the only one would not have an initial handicap and I think it would have a standard performance.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone in charge will support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing up the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with a mere blessing from the chairman of Babiš and without the People's Party, but with the People's Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a believer of the Social Democrat.
This mini-dismund government would have great stability, because it would enforce a proper referendum law and such a commitment to support the chairman of Dawn Okamura.
In the end, President Babiš would accept the progression of taxes, because he is keen and see that he cannot do without it.
The People's Party would not bring problems, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not be in government otherwise.
The same is true of ANO, a valuable minister would be found here, too, but if they do not want to enter into a risky government participation, but they will provide support, also well.
Let's give courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
The detention of Barta is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is he behind the leak of wiretaps?
The chairman of the Public Affairs, Vít Bárta, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Jan Petržílek, the head of the anti-corruption police department, was also detained.
The arrest is related to the wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
Information about the eavesdropping, which was reported by news server Novinky.cz, was confirmed by a trusted source to the Czech Press Office.
Eavesdropped phone calls by Janoušek and Bém, published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes and in which both men address each other "Mazánek" and "Hump-breeding", show Janoušek's influence on the city's actions under Bém's leadership.
The daily reported at the time that they were acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, from which two years later they escaped to the ABL security agency.
It was owned by Bart.
News server Novinky.cz reported that the detained criminalist Petržílek worked before his accession to the anti-corruption police for the BIS.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretaps, at the same time they were published.
"With regard to the Act on the Protection of Classified Information, I cannot confirm anything at all or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was supervising the case.
He does not want to comment on the inspections for the same reason.
Anti-corruption police officer also detained with Vít Bárta
Bart's lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV deputies, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but due to the protection of classified information, I can no longer comment on this."
According to the law, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS).
News server tn.cz reported that Bárta was able to buy classified information from the police.
According to news server, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to Bárta allegedly sought.
However, the latest information Rights shows that the detention of Vít Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.
Eva Kropáčová, spokeswoman for the Police Presidium, declined to comment on the case, saying that the case is being dealt with by the Prague City Prosecutor’s Office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokeswoman for the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague, told Právo on Friday.
It is the plaintiff who oversees Bart’s case, and therefore it is indirectly apparent from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under the regime of secrecy.
The reporter of the News managed to reach the wife of Vít Bárta Kateřina Klasnová in the morning before their residence in Klárov, Prague.
She was just loading her bags in the car and leaving.
She declined to comment on the incident.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Úsvit movement, Tomio Okamura, commented on Bárta’s detention.
He says he has no idea what is going on in the case.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our list, and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomio Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who ran unsuccessfully for the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomio Okamura in the previous early elections to the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case of bribing MPs of Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was not sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Subsequently, the verdict was amended and Barta was acquitted.
Concerns about Mosambique's security escalates over strong personality conflict
Under the statue of Samoura Machela, the founder's president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to shout peaceful slogans at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she swapped corporate clothing for a T-shirt adorned with the inscription “we demand safety” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, one of the worst skirmishes since the peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the rule of apartheid in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace deal in 1992, it became the opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely to break out an open conflict in the country again, but recent events have frightened foreign investors and locals.
A fast-growing economy is at stake because discovering large-scale offshore reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest can bring investment worth more than $50 billion from companies such as Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and U.S. Anadarko, over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
The Renamo party claims the government has sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in Sofala province on September 17, the traditional stronghold of the Renamo Party.
The violent assault of former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo Fernando Mazanga, a party spokesman for the Financial Times.
The government blames the renavigation for launching the Veramos, because it is said to have been attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to alleviate fears of instability.
Mr. Guebuza told the French press office of AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a "failer" who wanted to use "anything left of his powers to try to prove that he could order the government's own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But concerns increased when Mr Mazanga's comments were quoted as saying that the Renamo party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT newspaper that he meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mr Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease tensions between these parties, fueled by a series of skirmishes this year.
It is a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which sought electoral changes, has already said it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort by the moribund movement to obtain benefits and financial proceeds from the government.
The electoral share of the Renamo party has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, will improve its position in the elections as expected.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza - whose second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a more democratic system of parties, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but he has carried out divisive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between the north and south.
Most of the skirmitoes occurred in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers away from the capital Maputo, but where the city of Beira is located, the port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, are in their exports of coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when the Renamo party threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to comment on whether Renomo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warning the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development, and the recent flood of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is solely borne by the government and the president, and that he should be the one who finds a solution to the problems,” he said.
Demonstrator Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo, nor Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Tripodi denies it was influenced by Obeide
The former Labour minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be under investigation by the State Committee for the Supervision of Corruption.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the offshore rental policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
An Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday extended its search for whether Mr Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to rent it on Circular Quay, where the Obeides owned two restaurants and a cafe, restored without having to take part in a tender after its expiration in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's classified interests on these properties, on the basis of evidence presented on Thursday by the former deputy head of the office, Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government has pushed for leases to public tenders.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought Opeid $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was the Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, urged a shift in government rental policies.
The transcript of the calls presented at the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obei and Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, the chief clerk who came to the port department after working under Mr. Obeido in the fisheries department.
"Was the subject of talks during these telephone calls the development of commercial rental policy?" auxiliary commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but certainly not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr Obeide.

Dog summed up carpet, president tripped and ended up on crutches
President Miloš Zeman left the Motool hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on a bed, and went to the chateau in Lány.
What is his health condition?
In Kunovice a bubbbed cabbber, chemistry does not add to it
In the coming months, more than a thousand tons of sucasm sugar want to be produced in Slovácko Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season started here in October and will last about half a year.
Since 1925, he has been producing a healthy delicacy here in the traditional way, i.e. pedaling directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, it is a rarity.
Our workers are walking a nearly ten-kilometre route per shift.
Each of the ten tanks can fit fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, the fulfillment of one takes three shifts," said David Kladroba, the director of the Slovácká Fruta plant.
The cabbage head is transported directly from their fields by farmers mainly from the Ostrožsko and Břeclav regions.
Fruty employees then clean the vegetables, remove the broomsticks and throw them in a glitter.
From there, the already cut cabbage falls into pools at a depth of six meters, at which pedals dressed in white clothing and boots work tirelessly.
This displaces unwanted air.
The last trampled layer of cabbbertion is covered with a tarpaulin and loaded with water.
"The cabbage cow then matures for six to eight weeks for spontaneous lactic fermentation without any addition of fermentation-promoting substances," emphasized the director of Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to production in domestic conditions, individual layers workers pour salt and cumin.
After fermentation, the cabbage goes to the filling line.
It is packed in sweet-sour brine into bags or jars and is subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
It also registers interest in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Damkka is said to have banned UEFA from posting penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the referees of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped posting sentences for judges.
It is forbidden by the UEFA rules, which she said in an interview with the daily Právo.
Otherwise, the FACR would be punishable.
Damková also refused to side with the footballers of Pilsen, where she came from.
These speculations are really nonsensical.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of a vote, I can lose 1:6," Damková said in response to the criticism that tumbled after Pilsen had recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Thus, although the FACR has stopped publishing penalties for referees in recent months, Damková assures that the judges pay for their mistakes.
"Trust me, if the committee finds out that the referee has made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, whatever match it was," Damková said.
The reason why the punishments are not published is, according to Damková, a ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and severely punishes violations."
"We're very suspicious here, and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published the limitations, but I received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, there will be harsh sanctions," Damková said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If the publication of the information continues, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of the referees.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them, we could not fulfill the agenda for the education of the referees," Damková added.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million versus $305 to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current developments are maintained, it will account for 12 to 17 percent of the 2011/12 record of a record increase of USD 290.4 million.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an eight percent profit in the first half of the year and began with a sharp growth in Australia and British off-proliferation.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards a record annual profit before interest and tax," he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
Recreational activities took up during the second half of Australia, which compensates for the slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreation area, while business clients spent less.
U.S. trade recovered after a loss during the season-highlight of the season, and is expected to bring a full-year profit for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
British police deliver Assange's release notice
British police delivered a statement today of the extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said he had delivered a "issuance announcement" to the 40-year-old Australian, saying he was asking him to attend the police station and that if he fails to do so, he could be in danger of arrest.
Assange has exhausted its options under British law when the Supreme Court annulled his appeal against extradition this month, thus facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sex crimes.
Because he feared Stockholm would have extradited him to the U.S., he searched 19. June refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where the South American country has sought asylum.
Scotland Yard "delivered a report to a 40-year-old man asking to attend the police station on the day and hour that were intended for him," the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate the bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the receipt of the release notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face allegations of espionage, because he posted 250 000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The Supreme Court has ruled: Nečas can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can also be prosecuted for any crimes that he could have committed before the August dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which refers to the manifestations in the House.
In the case of former ODS deputies Ivan Fuksa, Marek Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, on the contrary, he ruled that they cannot be punished for any crimes until they renounced their parliamentary mandate last November, said Petr Knötig, a spokesman for the Supreme Court.
The court rejected the proposal of the public prosecutor Ivo Ištvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the deputies.
According to him, they accepted a bribery in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and not making problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to prosecute the former prime minister, who offered them these posts.
Aircraft manufacturers are arguing for seat width, large orders are at stake
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, a dispute over the width of seats in the second class for long-range flights, which this month gave the cause of a bitter exchange of views on an air show in Dubai.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for economy class – not exactly the same that airlines would usually precede, but whose allocated space is the key to the demands of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but major U.S. rival Boeing says airlines are to decide that.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sale of the largest version of their twin-engine long-distance aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21.
The way the rear of the aircraft is distributed – especially whether it is 9 or 10 seats side by side – is the basis of economic performance demands on the design of new ‘mini-jumbo’ aircraft.
Boeing says the upgraded "777X" will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says that a competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread over 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in the professional media.
Airbus is now now ahead of an air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders, appeals to the public.
Recently, he has demonstrated what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed the financiers a picture depicting three people crowded in a restaurant with the headline "Would you like it?"
“Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in the seats narrower than they are on regional turboprops,” said John Leahy, Airbus’s sales manager.
As the food products change, people are larger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air travel, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to U.S. Department of Health data.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has 100 cm in the waist.
Airbus claims that its rival sticks to the concept of seats from the 50's, when the average width of the seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted research suggesting that expanding the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects the size of Airbus's seats and says it's not within the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says research shows that the cabin experience depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
"The real thing is about providing airline flexibility and allowing them to do things they believe they need to do to make them successful," Cabin compartment expert Kent Craver said.
They don't want us to dictate to them what brings them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
More room for elbows is essential for passengers, but for suppliers, this is an increasing problem that can affect revenue.
Behind this dispute is the plant in aircraft orders with an estimated deal in the coming decades worth at least $700 billion at catalog prices, enough to skewer the reeds of US and European exports.
As reported in July by Reuters, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that they achieve 20 percent better efficiency for its latest designs for dual-engine long-range aircraft than market leaders in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
Boeing's performance demands depend in part on the comparison of the 777X design with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to pack more seats and make its planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the 10-seat boots in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"Forty-five-centimetre row, a passenger seat would be great, but the reality is that from an entrepreneurial point of view, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777 model," said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airline suppliers a catalog of suppliers to choose.
Traveled aircraft dealers even carry a measuring zone with them to check the competitive arrangement.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a highly dense arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
The Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for a larger cabin modification by offering wider seats in the aisles for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single additional manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard, but may discourage the 777X sales wave.
CME is targeting the TV business.
They'll lay off nearly a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to slim down a thousand people.
He intends to cut all the secondary activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns TV Nova in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4 500 people.
Nearly a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates televisions in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME includes CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what it will mean for the domestic TV number one TV Nova is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really can't comment on it," said Josef Koukolíček, Director of Communications at Nova.
According to MF DNES, the significant redundancies of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but this should have far the greatest impact on the personnel status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new Novy bosses Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined long-time director Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday that they wanted to reduce all activities that are directly related to the TV business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce, in particular, the cost of production of their own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents of the defunct company, filed a lawsuit on Thursday for violating patents against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it overlicited in the auction under the bankruptcy of Nortel.
The Rockstar Concorde, which purchased Nortel's $4.5 billion patents, has sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement at the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps connect terms searched on the Internet with the relevant advertising, the lawsuit states, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that work on the Google Android operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a default price quote of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the battle for Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business motivated partly by a group of patents by Motorola.
“Subjects, despite the failure to obtain patents under the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe the patents,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because Google says the patent is being violated by Google, as the lawsuit claims.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story of independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for the membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be his accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected, this was not reflected in the headlines of the newspaper.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adjusting their official laws if it suits them.
Since Scotland is not in Schengen now, the supply of continued mismatch would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And so old that it became an excavator. I heard the journalistic duck that “independence means passport controls” at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting idea in this bearded story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to obey Europe?
Why exchange a London-based dom for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a real European story: the big post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
Due to the euro crisis, the so-called Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, the influence of the parties are initiated by the opposition to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came from nowhere and already in the September federal elections captured almost five million votes, essentially “sweaking” the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
On home soil, there has always been a dislike of the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The economy dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with a straitjacket threaded to the national economies through clinging to the common currency, have led many people to believe that the Europe project had gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments manage a high budget deficit – that was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of euros that blocks its members at exchange rates advantageous for German exporters – and German politicians want to keep that.
Without the possibility of devaluing the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in the domestic production sector compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut income and public spending – which is what Germany encourages.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is a deeper cause of European malaise performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German firms at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much as electricity and four times more for gasoline than is in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the area of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the wages freeze in the world would not avert the sealing of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering rebellative, especially in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool to keep Germany at bay and allow Paris to stand up to the level of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a card of political legitimacy and has established its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major extra election and pushed the ruling Socialists third.
The front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that the cleavage of the right will automatically positively affect the left.
How does Le Pen handle her newfound popularity among the white working class?
Next year’s European elections would like to make an anti-European bloc operating against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in this election, which is likely, such a bloc may dominate for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
It occurs to me that in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and the attitude against the common currency will come together and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but will be transformed rather into something looser in the sense of the “Europes (Souvenient) of the Nations,” which was preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and adhere to the United States.
But Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area of (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of announcing Berlin and Brussels, when they should leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in Europe's relaxed arrangement, provided it retaining its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – surprisingly – the most successful political movement that does not promote austerity measures in Europe, which was won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition stance on the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence just to take austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Parents of intersex children can choose “indefinite sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize the third gender in children born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified only to either male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to mention any sex to such children, and allows them to list the sexes as “indefinite” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to make hastily decide on their child to have surgery to determine gender and fight discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person said after many years: “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain a patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year 2000 of the children are born one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual disorders, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (evaes or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
The sex could be Wallis Simpson.
Determining gender is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to determine gender, it is better to use the best available information and determine it instead of waiting and following the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is carried out, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-to-determine problems, said the new German law "looks like a good thing."
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but for most children it is not," he said.
Determination of the sex can be done without surgery, and then it can wait to see how the identity develops.
Knowledge of how a child develops a sexual affiliation is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report transmitted to the European Committee in 2011 by intersex persons as different from transgender or transgender people because their status is not linked to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically composed of both and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital tract, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the field of work, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or “third-sex” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world’s first recognized “sex” person in June when she won a court appeal to be able to maintain the status of a “indetermined” gender for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have, in addition to M (men) and F (woman), as well as the third designation, X, for intersex persons.
In neighboring France, according to an intelligence report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove "gene theory" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic website online also opposed the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is being dragged to a new state, when the sex is a question of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are turning two other pillars of civilization inside out.”
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see the children's gender at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your child,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome Greek, who had a dual gender.
And about a decade back, the medical community thought that gender was something like a whiteboard that could be erased and redrawed again.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, with the fact that gender affiliation is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make a decision incorrectly because they do not know how, given their gender, children will feel when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The persevering theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sexes was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who was of the opinion that gender was subordinate.
He created a new term "sexual affiliation" and argued that the social causes and environmental influences - how parents raised their child - acted on children's genes and hormones and shaped the child, regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in a case of 1966, known as "John/Joan," his theory became questionable.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged due to poorly executed circumcision, to let their child be neutered, remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he allowed himself to be back on the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors are still using this model today.
But in the 90's, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared "fare with the result."
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous genital system.
Doctors were unsure about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfactory life."
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent for a susceptic of the vagina.
But because he was depressed and knew something wasn't right, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After birth, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender (DSD) disorder that prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genital tract.
After learning the truth, he turned back to men, taking testosterone doses and having his bust removed,
The operations caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the legal group Advocates for choice, based in California, fears that the German law “wrote and stigma” is concerned that the German law calls for branding and stigmata.
“Many activists fear that the German law will achieve that they will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose ‘indefinite’ for the child.”
We're afraid it's going to be annoyed by the intervention.
We believe that it is better to allocate the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will come out in the end, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because she "all allows adults to be classified in the third gender."
"The adult should be able to make their own decision on the legally applicable gender," she said.
The German law is about to allocate it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not be seduced at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh chest radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law would “do the powers” to both parents and children.
Daughter Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has an DSD called androgens insensitivity syndrome.
Because its androgenic receptors are defective, Katie's female features have evolved.
It has a vagina, but it has no uterus and ovaries.
Now, 29-year-old Katie is married and works as an intern in child psychiatry as a studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some room not to rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and make up your mind, and it gives them time before they write a "man" or "woman."
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise your child and love him.
You have an amazing child and you enjoy it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
“This brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child decides what gender he identifies with more – and that’s a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The bird was airlifted from the North Sea drilling platform and released back into nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One of the rattlesnapped was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after it was previously treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue resort until it healed.
The operations centers of Colin Seddon said: "This rattle probably migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind caught over the North Sea."
Apparently, he ran out of strength and found refuge on an oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was not able to take off again, so they contacted us with a request for help."
By the time he was rattlespy, he was in good shape and healthy.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who will carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Together with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník period (from the geological point of view) of recent.
The last eruptions were still at the beginning of the Quaternary.
Looking from a greater distance, at the top of Uhlířské vrch is a striking white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn, which was standing next to the church, did not behave.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley from four rows of linden trees was planted, about 1 km long.
The Way of the Cross on Uhlířské vrch is already the third version, the original one stood after 1916, the second, from 2001 lasted only until 2004.
At fifteen stops are wooden sculptures made by local art carver František Nedomlel.
It used various types of wood species from the Low Jeseník region.
Similarly, the stems from rocks from the local area form an interesting geological exposition.
The name of the sponsor is also indicated at each stop.
The hill is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric measurements of age vary slightly, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudný (yes 3,3 million years old) and older than Venus's volcano (yes0.8 million years).
The volcano was born by an explosion.
In doing so, she threw out a significant amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rocks from the bedrock, which by burning gained a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption eavested red, brownish-red and sometimes black tufficker.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the tuffs, volcanic bombs are up to 1 meter in size. The second eruption was also ended by a lava outburst.
At the end of the activity, the volcano leaked out of the volcano, which today forms a powerful layer of slag basalt.
Volcanoes that alternate with the ejectionation of volcanic ash with lava flows are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they're actually composed of layers, they've been named stratocolans.
The original volcanic cone was gradually subject to erosion.
However, he was threatened by mining rocks in a quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in 1953 - 1962.
The tubes were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Mining was stopped under pressure from experts and the public and thus preserve this unique place.
The problem, however, is in the porosity and low cohesion of rocks, which quickly weather, crumble and slide down the slope.
The quarry disappears quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The remedy is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
Uhlířský vrch can be reached by the green tourist sign from Bruntál, or from Silesian Kočov.
Carers can use an unpaid parking lot at the beginning of a linden alley, where a short nature trail begins.
The drunk poured gasoline all over the house: He threatened to burn it with his own family!
Tensions increased, fear escalated.
The man began to threaten to set the whole house on fire.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the vicinity went to the scene, as well as a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire brigadier.
A police negotiator also arrived at the scene, trying to convince the man of his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
A task force had to enter the house, defusing and handing the man down.
The aggressor then ended up for an examination in the Mladá Boleslav hospital, from where he was taken to an anti-alcohol detention station.
Firefighters eventually covered the house poured with a sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to the people, all domestic animals were rescued from the house.
The man did not put on the police negotiator, so the commando went to him.
Anger over a judgment handed down over Bali bomb attack bomber
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a 2002 Bali bombing in a lightened sentence against the last of the wards who were brought to justice and said Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted individuals in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for building explosive devices that were used in a bomb attack.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist region of Kuta, after which 202 people were dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded life imprisonment, even though she could insist that a man with the nickname "Demolition man" (bourter) thanks to his reputation as an explosives maker expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack triggered by Patek and other connoisseurs almost a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP agency, Mrs. Corteen said: "Should be placed before the firing squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see the other grandchildren and my daughters.
Club Sari was razed to the ground when it was 12. October 2002, shortly after 23 a.m., a heavy bomb was launched in an outdoor parked van.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar where, just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber hit a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, he "died" three times.
Mr Hughes said Patec should meet the same fate as the three other members of the Jama Islamiya terrorist cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudru – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like nobody.
To keep him alive... There's no reason to keep him alive is just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds more is not so much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers.
He avoided the arrest for nearly a decade, but was eventually apprehended in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where less than four months later, U.S. forces were killed by former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to reestablish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt pity for how much grief he had caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and will include a ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek may still appeal against the judgment.
Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis 22. He will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in February.
The cardinals are the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the pope and are the ones who vote for the Pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will eventually help to select his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – the group thus shrinks to 120 electrifying cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a gathering of contemporary cardinals known as the consistency of the conservatory will be held before the ceremonial urination of the new cardinals.
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February conspiratorial in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals is likely to fall by February.
He said the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed to increase the number of electors again to 120, and as many cardinals exceeding the age of 80 as he wants.
The conistory next year will be significant as it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain focus on Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope is nominating cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to whom he gave the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that the pope would ask these cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s a complete novelty.
Valero said the popes traditionally escalated bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is "fulfills of surprise - so we don't know who he's appointing."
Announced series of racing Land Rovers
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as intercommunication equipment.
There are improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between races.
Drew Bowler, chief technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The race participants who come to Bowler have changed."
Not everyone is experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an achievable journey to world-class races.
We are delighted to offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of the Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Living legend Wayne Shorter to close next week Strings of Autumn
Saxon giant and jazz scene legend Wayne Shorter will make a dot for the 18th edition of the Strings of Autumn festival next Wednesday.
Shorter will perform on November 6 in the Great Hall of Lucerna together with his quartet consisting of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will join Shorter with the spontaneous jazz improvisation of the PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's arrangements for the symphony orchestra will feature the song Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older tracks Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which is also proven by the fact that the Prague concert on Struns of Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers with whom he worked ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and the Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom they set the direction of the new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
He has been performing with Wayne Shorter Quartet for the past thirteen years.
A kind of afterparty after the festival will be the club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin will present the Czech audience with his jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis demonstrated exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, they sent the planes, which hit the target and returned.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event and are no longer commenting on it.
The exact opposite of the confused and big-mouthed, actions unsupported by Obama's Syrian policies.
And the most satisfying thing about the attack was what the Israelis were bombing.
Don't be fooled by the media's claims that a "Syrian base" or "supplies for Hezbollah" have been bombed.
I recently wrote here that while the aid to the U.S. secular rebels in the country remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia continues to supply Syria’s weapons cheerfully.
And it was the fresh supply of Russian missiles lined up in the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli airstrike.
A clear message.
And note, Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the insurgents, although it should be the other way around, according to popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government honored 2 members of the undersite troops, probably Delta force.
It has not been known until now that they had distinguished themselves during the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Bengazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs, who defended the CIA in the city, is known, and I think it was members of a secret CIA commando made up of former soldiers.
There has long been speculation about what SEALs did at the consulate or even the CIA residence elsewhere.
Now it's clearer.
In any case, the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (it is one of the two SEALs members who died after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of the American commandos in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news of the attack in Bengazi volunteered to intervene and together with five private contractors shot their way to the CIA campus in Bengazi.
The Obama administration is defrauding the fact that during that attack the commando was not deployed officially and the whole, and that it was simply hesitant to do what to do.
Commander of the commando, so without orders, will apparently release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country operates not once, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
This is due to the fact that until recently nothing like this was officially acknowledged, and even now there is talk only of a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the U.S., even though it is trying to fight terrorism in Libya.
Although it would take much greater help to resolve the national situation.
The last place of a secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised the Iranian air force for prosecuting American drones.
But little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in the airspace, there is nothing you can do about it.
However, if an Iranian drone is discovered in an international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom aircraft chased the American drone in the international space above the sea, when perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super F-22 Raptor fighter in history occurred.
He flew under Phantom to visually verify his armament without Phantom registering him on the radar or simply noticing him, and then when he suddenly appeared at him and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed the one without murmuring.
No wonder Phanto is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
The court blocked the order concerning the procedure of stopping and searching persons by the police department in NY
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order calling for changes to a stoppage and search program at the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
A second U.S. federal appeals court said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the appeal decision filed by the city.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city contested its conclusions and its corrective regulations, including the decision to assign supervision to help the police department change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The appeals court heard arguments for the required postponement on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said the judge must be removed from the case because she was in conflict with the rules of conduct for judges, by not acting as a judge as a judge, she had acted as a demand to avoid a secrecy of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement, which she openly responded to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officials violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their refugee stop and search program.
It has established independent supervision to oversee the main changes, including reform in procedures, training and supervision, and to order the launch of the pilot program to test the cameras worn on the body in some areas where the most frequent stopping people take place.
In August, the city of New York approved the end of the method of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after police search.
The oral justification for the city's appeal is scheduled sometime after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching persons have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there has been a halting and search for people for about a number of decades, but the recorded searches under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases they were blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are minorities, filed a lawsuit that had become a case of a group lawsuit.
Advocates of changes to the NY Stop and Search program by the police department say the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and affect how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opponents say the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but the wider problem will not be solved when the police force is under pressure after its numbers have decreased by several thousand people over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching the persons that is constitutional, but reformed the way the searches of the NY Police Department introduced.
CDC Center has issued guidelines on allergy in children for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in the case of baby food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the U.S. government because the number of school-aged children suffering from food allergies is rising.
One in 20 children in the United States has an allergy to food.
The CDC Center found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools on how to notify the teaching staff and staff about dietary allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
Also, it recommends schools to have adrenaline available – EpiPen’s automatic injector is most often used – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The state legislature recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms appearing in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, “It’s like someone is injecting my tongue,” “I feel like I’m wearing hair on my tongue” or “My tongue itches.”
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
However, I did not finish it, because there was someone sitting in the branch who could not finish registration from the Internet.
And because I didn’t want to go to another branch, the registration fell through, then I moved and thanks to that changed my address and ID number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it was not possible, because I have a different OP number, address and that it just can not be completed and that I should ask for the deletion of the data and make a new registration.
So I did this and 24.10.2013 I wrote on technical support that I ask for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable law on the protection of personal data.
On this day, the technical support wrote to me that I should complete the registration at the branch.
This started the marathon of e-mails for technical support, where they finally wrote after the 4th urge 25.10. that they deleted the personal data at my request.
So one would think that he could make the new registration and here again the problems started again at first it wrote me that my username is already occupied (understand it was not deleted - it is not a personal data, but in the end they also eliminated this).
So I used a different username and it jumped out that my personal data already have stored to complete registration at the branch (how can they have something stored that they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
When asked how it is possible, they wrote me back that they actually deleted the personal data on 25.10. and to send an email with the error.
I did that (yesterday around 15 o'clock) and on that today they wrote me off that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that's why I couldn't, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I have been contacting the technical support for a week and I deal with them that it is still not possible.
And what if it were true what he claims (as is not) could not register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in the 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and phone number and world wonder, it appeared to me that I was sent a link to the e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is this possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport ties registration to e-mail and phone number and simply didn't discard the data as he claims.
So I once again told this to technical support that they simply lie (either intentionally or they don’t know what they are writing), because what they write is not true.
I have documented several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so "fake" registration simply does not affect this.
Tipsport wrote me off a terrifying sentence for that - I'm sorry, but by being registered again, we can't check your claim.
And he ended communication.
Respectively, it repeats the same sentence that the registration binds to the name and date of birth.
They can not accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and so it did not even take place.
So, if I sum it up, Tipsport not only hasn't deleted the data he claims, but he's still lying when he claims otherwise.
Worse, it is possible to easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer's side.
By the way, after mentioning this matter on my personal blog, things started a little bit and from Technical Support came an e-mail that they pass the matter for review and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and warning about the same mistake).
We are sorry for the killing, but we are innocent, defended by the representatives of the Khmer Rouge
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy, and Khieu Samhanh is the former head of state.
During the Khmer Rouge government, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and executions, or at least a quarter of the population of the time.
The commander of the notorious S-21 prison was awarded a life sentence of prison for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are allegations of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samhan defended themselves by believing they were acting in the nation's best interests and having no idea what the true scale of killing was.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, to understand everything and therefore intervene and correct the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered the Khmer Rouge cadres to "treat people badly or kill them to deny them food or commit genocide."
He acknowledged the "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologise to the public, the victims, their families, everything to the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP that she could not accept the nuon Cheo's apology."
"Lying us."
"She just wants to be acquitted."
"They don't care about others," she said.
"If he had not issued orders, his subordinates would not have killed," she added, adding that the Khmer Rouge leaders were "worse than monsters."
The "foreign Foreign Minister" of the Khmer Rouge regime Ieng Sary was also to stand trial, but he died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then-Minister of Social Affairs, was found by a court in September 2012 in an incapable of dementia.
The leader of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, died in 1998.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British businessman made the first ice cream to shine in the dark – using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea when he read a scholarly treatise on a jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes glowing.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s tongue – it increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream shines when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, and therefore the more you lioch, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (lick me up, I taste great), says, "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so for £200 you get about 2 g of this fabric."
The egg white we use in ice cream responds with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats the protein, the pH level increases, and the ice cream begins to shine.
We've tested it over the past few months and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween as it's causing this fantastic radiant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the luminous jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every hill costs me about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its non-traditional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, this is impossible because of the refraction of the light caused by the ice crystals that make the ice cream, but I reckon that we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Ski resorts want to make families with children cheaper
Oil prices plunge further to $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as the concern for high inventories was offset by the news that showed the strengthening of China's energy-squeaker manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil indicator for December deliveries fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in European e-commerce trading on the New York Stock Exchange in late morning.
On Thursday, the drop was 39 cents and fell by 5.8 percent for the month of October.
Rich oil reserves have burdened the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. inventories had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, the stockpile increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, from two reports on Chinese production, the impetus for greater demand came to the increase in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery, after growth, which rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades, could continue to strengthen.
Brent crude oil, an indicator for international oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents per barrel on the London International Trade Stock Exchange.
Martin Doktor on problems with the Olympic Games in Sochi: Communication with Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he just exhales deeply: "It's challenging."
Cooperation with the organizing team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a little more complicated, according to Martin Doktor.
We can forget what was at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same way," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
Many things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of supplying information about essential things not so much.
For example, we have been turning from them for three months to give us how individual villages will be officially marked so that we can do a number of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they keep saying they're communicating that thing.
They communicate all the time in a number of things.
Is the Olympic Village completed?
But it's no longer a disastrous state.
We walked around empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Do you need ready-made floors?
Only the basic concrete, that was the state a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26 as a vanguard, there will still be glue.
And if they didn't make it, there's gonna be what?
Would President Putin mean there drive the army?
That's the way it's gonna turn out.
Just so it wasn't that the Olympic Village = Potimkin's village.
Rather, they threaten to not make it, for example, to modify the roads, they do not finish the details.
They may have the paths in such a state that we will have to take the boots from the London Games with us.
But I believe they'll put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
For example, the figure skaters will probably go in the trio who went out.
No one has to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I shouldn't go there until January 26.
We know what the houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things on the subway so that we didn’t just believe the sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports, plus I am doing a common agenda in the sense of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Place of post-election sirloin post-election goulash
The October elections, rather than the winner, brought a bunch of losers.
It is not just parties that did not even make it to the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD because of its internal split.
Politicians served us a post-election steu for us instead of a festive sirloin over the weekend.
The scandal of the elections was the movement of Andrej Babiš, which promised voters to change the current political style of governance.
The fragmentation of the electoral result and the split in the winning party is played by the political (creation of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported the party that President Zeman has not even elected to the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the president has lost a strategic lead over other politicians because of the awkward event, he still has a few ways to get him back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the ČSSD is moving away from the chances of winning the prime minister’s seat in my eyes, the businessman, on the contrary, is getting closer to Andrej Babiš.
The post-election development is still miles away from the early and smooth formation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of the ČSSD supported by the Communists, this development is a better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.
Due to the loud opposition of ANO to get together with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely option for the coalition of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies).
Given the split in the ČSSD, which thus became an illegible and weak parterre in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations may be quite slimming for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD, composed of "nezemanovs" at the Castle, is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, “Are we not going to lead by self-succeous to another early election?”
The next election would be more of a referendum on the strength of the ANO movement's voter.
The ČSSD’s plans to introduce sectoral taxes, make it more significant increase in income taxes or building a state bank, hopefully, under the table.
The parties ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit, on the other hand, agree, for example, on the support of business, a modest fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the support of the employment of disadvantaged people, a reduction of a lower VAT rate for selected goods.
Friction surfaces are most common in the view of social policy and the size of the state.
ANO, however, now has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition of ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean rather to the right.
In the end, this is a better result than a left-wing tax program on everything that is still moving in the economy.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted an early election.
Corruption, waste of money for overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that most citizens were satisfied with this situation.
That they didn't really mind and the state that was there (theft and indebtedness of this state) was actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3 413 497 voters did not attend the elections, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted for the ODS, a total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.11% of all eligible voters.
Which is an absolute majority.
When I add 1 016 829 ČSSD voters to the above-mentioned parties, then with the old order (because all the parties involved in the "stealing" and the indebtedness of this state, 64.23% of the rightful voters actually agreed to this situation.
In this way, most voters have shown that they are not in favour of punishing the culprits of stealing and over-indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who participated in this will be the right law?
Is it even to help us?
Olomouc opens in the historic center of the public ice rink
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating, Pavel Spálený, said that the preparatory work on the ice rink began on 26. October and since Wednesday has been in operation an aggregate for ice production.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be prepared for the first visitors.
The ice rink has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two punch stands.
"We have expanded the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stalls, and almost the entire area of the podia is roofed so that the skaters can comfortably change," Spálený said.
The streets of Olomouc are already commemorated by the approaching Christmas.
Last year, due to the repair of the Lower Square, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of summer, so the ice rink could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the ice rink was open from January to March.
The ice rink then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will start on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Eve.
Scientists have given more annoying how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Earlier research has shown that joyful dogs wagging their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wave their tail mostly to the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can record these subtle differences in the movement of the tail and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortipara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: "It is well known to humans that the left and right sides of the brain have different links to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
We tried to observe the same thing in other species.
He added that, as is the case with humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information about how dogs respond to asymmetrical stings of the tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and other times on top of that.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have projected dogs films about dogs - whether in the natural version or in the form of a silhouette - to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the movement of the tail and represent it more to the right or left."
When the animals saw an otherwise insignificant dog moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of a dog wagging its tail), they remained completely calm.
But when she recorded the rotation of the tail mostly to the left (again from the point of view of a dog wagging a tail), their heart rate increased and the animals looked uncertain.
Professor Vallortipara said he didn't think dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they have to and that they do not have to look out for.
He said: "If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior, and the movement to the right breeds less friendly behavior, you will respond based on this experience."
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a university veterinarian at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side were important to dogs.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads off as they observe an aggressive dog, and to the right, looking at a cheerful dog.
And in another expert treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dog robot was more likely to become acquainted with a dog robot when they were wagging their tail to the left than to the right, when they were rather insecure – exactly compared to the Italian study.”
According to him, the difference may be due to the fact that dogs in these various studies did not interpret animals in movies or dog robots completely as dogs.
He explained that studies on how dogs respond to real dogs could help.
“Even though there are strong evidence in the case of many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and another to the other.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Scottish Bank (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that global investigation by the control authorities on suspicious currency machinations is becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, where they change owners of $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in the context of an expanding investigation that is a response to the LIBOR-manipulation Manipulation scandal (Londean Interbank Interest Rate).
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our unceasing search for this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said.
Last month, people close to the incident said that RBS had handed over to the UK financial conduct body records of emails and instant messages from accounts and to the former merchant's accounts.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position as European foreign currency trading president at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European chairman of ready-made money trading at Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former head of currency trading in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders was charged with any misdemeanour.
Mr. Usher's group for instant messaging included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people initiated in this event said.
UBS said this week that, after Swiss regulator Finma announced that it had investigated suspicious machinations in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, it had taken action against some of its employees.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Office of Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examines the claim that these bankers have conspired to move the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are combing years-old quick messages and emails to find cases of misdemeanors.
Reports on investigations alarmed traders in the area, which was one of the largest profit-making engines at the closure of investment banks in past years, but which was disrupted by the fact that the low volatility of currencies limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the gravity of the situation when they argued that with a vast and highly liquid market with foreign currency it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say this is not necessarily true.
A high-ranking trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily trading in foreign exchange rates, liquidity biting between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means “you can start to have an effect on the market at relatively low prices.”
The news came on the same day Credit Suisse announced that it had released from its trading department of the trader, which caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately alerted the relevant authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
"We are confident that this trader acted alone and that this issue has been resolved," Credit Suisse said in a statement.
He negotiated with the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people's party sent Jan Kasal against Babiš.
The People's Party won fourteen MPs in the elections, i.e. only a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of ANO.
But they enter into negotiations on the government with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already started to argue with the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who, under the People's Party, tuned the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
This time it will probably be commemorated by the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Driver fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted at his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had a drink cup between his thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to accusations that he was driving carelessly and inattentively.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to reimburse the £90-£1 cost and a £100 mark-up for the accused.
Prospal: I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have juice, lust and enthusiasm
For Prospal, a family has always been the first priority, so she wants to submit to it fully at the age of 38.
He either gets a job overseas and he'll still extend his career, or he's definitely quitting hockey.
"I want to play the role of my dad and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for the offer.
Despite the fact that he is a renowned worker who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and can tear down his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player in Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still," he declares determinedly.
Maybe he'll wait, he's reportedly being branded by the New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season and have two supporters injured - forwards Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like with your arrival at the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in worrying about it.
I know there was an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that's all.
Nowhere was it delivered that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce that I have a contract, but it just isn't.
Did you not even hear from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a day.
That's where it's about getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When a player gets hurt or someone can't do it and the manchaft doesn't pedal.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get the contract.
But there are similar circumstances in New York, right?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make it into the season, so there's a chance there, don't you think?
Of course, the chance is always.
The second thing is, you always need two pages for that.
I would take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
This is, unfortunately, the reality I have to live in.
You're going to America on Friday, are you expecting anything to work out after all?
I have those expectations from 5. July, when the free agent market opened up in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind you?
I'm definitely not, I'm going to Tampa to see the kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have your program planned?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what's going on.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of dad and husband and I'm really looking forward to it.
Vasik already has two hockey matches on Sunday, this is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking about doing this in quotation marks on full-time?
Sure, one can think about a lot of things.
This could happen, too.
I tried it three years ago, when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very much.
One day it will get to such a stage that all the goals, the victories and passes will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever your job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play the NHL just because it's the NHL, or it's because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, in the first place - in addition to the family - also includes sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is based on.
My children, that is, sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we would love to continue this trend.
Because what we're going to tell ourselves, there's options in America somewhere else.
We should offer them that chance.
Are you planning to stay in America permanently?
We're going to practice it as before.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic in Hluboká and in the vicinity of České Budějovice.
And in the winter, in Tampa or where we will take our steps.
That's perfect, to be warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say I went to meet him, it cost him a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took me a lot of things I missed.
But hockey in turn offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where to live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to do this so they can choose what to do and how they will live.
How long will you have your will to work, train hard and wait for the offer?
Yeah, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have in the NHL, that I am still better than someone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's going to stay there.
It can't be planned.
So you can say that this season you wait, how will it come out and then decide what to do next?
I'm at the stage when I'm going day by day.
Distant planets, black-and-white films, or a bit of fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not themes that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would pitch a lot.
In the concept of its quartet, which on November 6 in the great hall of Prague's Lucerna will culmise this year's Strings of Autumn festival, everything is related to everything.
The quarter of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter are the current feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are supposed to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber matter and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, of course, the newly eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, the bearer of nine Grammys, a former bandmate of Miles Davis and today probably the greatest living jazz saxophonist - does not like to explain.
He doesn’t talk much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of eighty, I came to the conclusion that it is best to let life be surprised.
“So many people plan everything and then they’re disappointed when things turn out differently,” Shorter said.
Jagr joked: Goal from the break?
In the defense zone, he got the puck, and no one caught it anymore.
In addition, he turned the leak after a quick forehand loop.
Jaromír Jágr scored like this against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday night the 119th NHL goal commented on Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent, Petr Svoboda, was contacted by the director of Czech Railways and asked him if I would be interested in making an advertisement for their state-of-art Pendolino train!" Jagr wrote at the outset with exaggeration.
I'm saying we're very similar in type.
I guess I'll have to quit night training so I can't speed up any more.
"I'm afraid the defense minister might call after that and he wants to advertise for jets!" he added.
New Jersey also claimed its second consecutive win.
"And most importantly, you noticed - the treatment of Marie Rottrová works," Jagr concluded.
The brutal murder of a senior in the Zlín region will be dealt with again by the regional court
The Regional Court acquitted a twenty-five-year-old Slovak and a twenty-two-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men denied guilt.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the High Court overturned the regional decision and returned the case to him for consideration.
He declined to comment on the reasons for the judge, saying the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the youths raided a seventy-seven-year-old man in his home.
Senior died a tormented death.
According to the indictment, the men strangleled, beat and kicked him all over his body, and also with a metal object, apparently with a gas gun, inflicted about three dozen wounds in the head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the cerebace cerebricular, swelling of the brain or bleeding in the brain, which he succumbed to on the spot.
The youngsters allegedly took about 3000 crowns from the house and jewellery worth about 14 thousand crowns.
According to the Regional Court, the only, moreover, only circumvent evidence against the defendants were the scent traces, which the expert assessed as not fully ascertained within the meaning of the legal instructions.
Although the scent traces from the scene of the crime and on other things coincided with the defendants in more than ten cases, the police initially treated them as substantible and not scent traces.
In addition, there were some errors in handling them.
According to the Senate, the defendants' guilt has not been proven without a doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
Even the emergency medical examiner did not warn of the violent death.
A few days later, the detectives were contacted by Olomouc doctors, who discovered the signs of violent death during the autopsy.
Police could no longer work with all the clues from the scene that the relatives had cleaned up.
There was no DNA on the defendants.
A young Slovak lived in Uherské Hradiště.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was finally upheld by the Olomouc High Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six youths responsible for robbery of a jewellery shop.
Robberies happened in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopny.
The younger of the accused of murdering a senior live in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Will Czech Television ever do without signing events?
She entered the era of President Zeman with a legendary scene with a garbage cane, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that collect documents of the castle retinue.
In the past, the traditiond influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík was not documented in this way, let alone to sign it.
True, the leaders were backed by the editors.
However, the cases described do not give an answer to the question of where such a lack of interest of some journalists is taken to the Zemanites - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or that we do not use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of inappropriate empathic helpfulness.
And when we assume a general rottenness, the question of whether other, no less interscrupulous power interests, which have not yet received an opportunity, seek a change in the situation on television.
Those who say that in developed countries there are no attempts to intervene politicians.
But the truth is that this does not mean that there are no complaints about the public media.
Comparators do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize what they consider to be the tenderness that is inherent in them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and this situation is not in our country.
But perhaps also in a country that thinks of himself is the most corrupt in the world, the black-and-white stories of evil politicians and good journalists spend more comfortably than more complicated descriptions of the confusing situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings encounters each other.
While there were crowds of experts in Cardiff to show off horses to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
No one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he's not going to school yet, and only a few months ago he took his first steps, this boy and his pet, Shetland's Pony Toffee, smoothly trotted through three rounds to eventually win the top prize and leave behind 30 protracted adult rivals.
This indissolubit pair – with the same height – was praised for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition operated by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
He stood against the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret to a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee parade around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control the horse, which far exceeds his age.
And Toffee got the highest grades for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee in March for his third birthday and has been practicing with this Shetland pony every day since.
His mother Donna (30) said, "Fenton and Toffee work great together."
They did not have high hopes, but in the end they left with the golden cup and the flower.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs Howells says, "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was cheering and applauding."
He ran on the sand along the entire length of the arena and although he seemed so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and was in charge of two chickens.
Given the way he started, he'll be back at the Horse of the Year competition again and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse demonstration competition said: "The Phentons are only three, but he already knows how to control a pony."
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they showed up on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork between the pony and the person who runs it is – and Fenton and Toffe were the best at the oval.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his adorable clothes, he really fell in with him.
Snowden is willing to 'cooperate' with Germany in connection with U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, a snitch on U.S. intelligence, has announced that he is willing to go to Berlin to pass evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed the possibility of witnessing him in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, who was handed over to the media on Friday in Berlin, it is stated: "Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, the government continues to treat the opposition as defectors and tries to criminalize political speech with heavy lawsuits that do not give room for defence."
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said he believed that supporting the international community could persuade the U.S. government to withdraw allegations of crimes against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online magazine: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to make this possible."
Tensions in the U.S.-German relationship began to rise when there was a claim that the NSA was eavesdropping on Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliament's oversaw the news, said that if any opportunity was to question Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting up danger and that relations with the U.S. were to be completely destroyed," should do so.
Mr Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German side of the Greens, posted on his Twitter post a photo of him and Mr Snowden.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to the former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left one day.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, a member of parliament said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a gritty and persistent campaign associated with persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world to his "act of political expression" gave him courage.
Citizens across the entire and high-ranking officials – including those in the United States – have assessed the revelation of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance for the service of the public.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
So I don't get scared of hate
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After long years of reading, he lived, but did not write, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Present.
That it will not be a slim volume suggests the number of pages comparable to his most famous work Housky (Petrov, 2001).
Another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl - interviewed Salon Kahuda.
What moved where has moved that you wrote a novel after twelve years of silence?
I did it - so as not to be afraid of hatred.
To see around you still new and new clones of that human foolish pettiness, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I am not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by helpless lust, peasant souls and vice-povers of ideologues who try to sell their "product" with the expression of a small selling whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my jurodé friends, weirdos and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks and then read books by the lamp in the evening.
You're talking about a sense of frustration, hate.
Has there been a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old, like all of us?
The turning point ago had happened a long time ago, about ten years old.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, that's what I was after.
There is still a surprised silent boy somewhere inside.
I see more solitary exercisers, everyone in their tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I participate in the giant, thousands of years of movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an elusive future.
The immense, breathtaking complexities of life, when each stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, when the path of trial-and-error arises another generation of beings who, in trillions of interactions per second, creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-speaking, or rather, dialogue, which is conducted by the right and left half of the brain, occasionally sets sail to the surface and formed into a book.
Just as the period of peace is interwoven with the silently dormant metastases of wars that may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the mute avalanche of life grow in my brain, and if I didn't do anything, one day I'd be quietly overflowing.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and asks them to layers that are stored in the darkness "under the surface of consciousness."
Neocortex, the gray cortex, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient leto rings of the cerebral strom.
He speaks to the fury beasts, asks snakes, seeks an answer in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry heaven above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Rellally, you often speak to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical ties all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced in question.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branching the trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is exposed to a constantly changing presence, in an unceefing effort it tries to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are disturbances from overload.
By analogy - as if your "fall" PC, from the speech emulator program and the translator from foreign languages would get tangled first in the operating environment, for example, Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts, it ended up with the dark green-liberated screen of Bios, in the basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about - I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why are you regularly interested in this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the meantime, the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behaving - a chasm will appear.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "So long he stared into the abyss until the abyss looked into him."
Pure feeling - that a person is lost, if all hopes disappear, mentally "die" and a new quality is coming.
And why am I interested in it personally?
I will respond with the parable.
Once upon a time, one fell into a pool and drowned, the days, months and years passed, he was still drowning, and he was still reading, and the books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a "diver".
Perhaps some sentence written by me will help someone, as Hrabal’s lyrics once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one of whom can not be told anything meaningful, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is involved directly in the process of word and sentence formulation."
From his early youth he read the books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in a submarine by Captain Nemo, running around the Shadows in dark alleys.
In the end, behind all the branches of the authors and their message, it reads: "The sun of the bright worlds of others Karel Hynek Mácha".
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
On the retrospective reflection that will come to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, after years, they randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some difficult life decision.
Books are actually "life" or rather "worlds."
They are encoded into the characters of letters, they carry the experience, the history of the regions of the language.
We can bring them to life at any time if we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It is, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to the old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the book is published, you - as it happens - a chain of authorial reading awaits you.
I remember you once glad you read.
Will you get into it again with joy, or do you feel different after years?
I prefer to just talk like that today.
And what did I find out about?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they are inconspicuous, they do not draw much attention to themselves, they have friendly radiance, you do not feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec lived there was (and I hope that he is still alive) one curly bookseller (named defectively Červenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl's bull.
In one drink, he introduced me to individual articles of a chain of readers of my book Housky.
I looked them in the eye and then I was shown a scruffy, read copy of my book.
I put aside the just read sausage and briefly wept the manly.
We were all silently standing there, swaying and drunkenly tearing with emotion.
Then the young blonde half-breed didn't stand it, and he jumped his head from the window into the snowdrift.
It was downstairs.
We ran out into the night landscape and were the happy rabies of the sensitive, the sore soul of the landowners and the homesickness of the sunken patriots - they went out and swept like the werewolves until the morning.
Each of your books is formally and content-of-the-art than the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, the darkness, the present?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about one country beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel, Suchodol puts the words of an old Russian myth in the mouth of a popular healer: At sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog, a grey chest of drawers on it.
Horror, horror, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe a long time ago we were devils in hell and drawn - what role we would play in this country.
Are you going to keep writing, or will you leave it again on the loose tides of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet affects our volition from such depth and in such a breadth that it completely transcends our horizon - and so, with absolute certainty, we act exactly in the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with the inflow of dopamine, mixtures of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die in defending and gaining new personal territories.
Sometimes a disorder happens and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disturbances, it stands on the coast of the ocean of the unconscious, and into the leaky sail made of a dirty handkerchief catches the tides of the warm wind.
I have to write to be human.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
During the lessons of English literature, it will be necessary to study at least one of Shakespeare's play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction since 1914.
The test will also include "hidden text" to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to have a graduation exam in the language, and they will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue a new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
Other major items are expected to change next year.
In a separate step, the Ofqual office, which oversees the graduation exams, reveals changes in the structure of the graduation exam, together with a new system of grades and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was a "widesimous consensus on whether we need to reform our test system to regain the confidence of society," and that the graduation exam is "more challenging, ambitious and stricter."
The study shows that English schools spend less time on maculature – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year on maculin and about 138 in Singapore.
Although there will be no official demand to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive graduation exam in mathematics – along with greater emphasis on this subject in the rankings – will probably encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “truth-world problems,” including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: I am not the Cancer in the ČSSD
Before the elections, the long-smoving dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava ČSSD was fully ignited.
Everything culminated when the Mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, went to court for the undemocratic compilation of the candidates.
Nevertheless, the actors in the case did not want to comment too much on this, so as not to harm the party even more before the elections.
But now the votes of the electorate are counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD immediately on Monday evening called on the mayor of Ostrava to step down from the party and will probably also push for him to lose his position.
Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What the disputes are about and who is on whose side is, he described in an exclusive interview for the Journal.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
The CSSD certainly counted on a much better result.
Did it harm her in our country that disputes within the party were resolved in the media before the elections?
I can imagine that the Social Democrats could have a better electoral result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now.
It's a party that has its internal problems, it's internally ill, and people perceive it, that everything is not right in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the CSSD?
In my opinion, the ODS has been going through a decline for some time, and unfortunately, such things are now taking place in social democracy.
It is the case that lobbyists, influential people who used to expect to find their prebends at the ODS, have moved to the people of the ČSSD and have an influence on them.
It is then related to the fact that the offices of the Ostrava City Hall go to the police and collect computers.
It shows that the ČSSD is not composed only of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily about their own good.
The ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Hašek and Sobotkovci.
But that has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a precursor to what is happening in Prague.
Hašek’s wing gradually occupied his positions so that after the elections it could provoke a situation that will weaken Sobotka’s wing.
One is in politics in a situation where sometimes you have to compromise.
But everyone has an inner limit where they can no longer make compromises, and that is my case.
Originally, I did not want to run for the Chamber of Deputies, but when I perceived the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get into the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotka’s wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But Hašek's wing gave it a stop.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michal Hašek?
In my opinion, Slávek Sobotka is a person who always talks about the ČSSD program and, to some extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I have to admit that I have not heard anything like this on the other side.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only start dismissing the party chairman.
This is a struggle for power, regardless of everything and against the party's statutes.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has now demonstrated in Prague, he ended his political career.
How you perceived that the Ostrava leadership of the ČSSD did not approve you for a candidate.
Political parties are based on competitions on who will be placed as a member of them.
The competition should be mostly based on programmatic visions and the abilities of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, people who don’t have much of abilities or visions are also applying for this competition, but a political party is a lift to money they wouldn’t get anywhere else.
The problem is when these people start to come to the fore because they violate the rules without scrump, violate the party's statutes.
By their practices, they make the political parties mafia and I think they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
Drawing attention to this problem is more important to me than to take into account whether a Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
So, before the elections, you filed a petition with the court for a preliminary injunction against the form of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by the fact that organizations that do not suit it can cancel, purposefully establish new organizations, gradually throw away uncomfortable party members.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then canceled the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that seeking to comply with the party's statutes through the courts is the last option, but at the moment when the other ways and control bodies within the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The aim of the leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD, headed by MP Adam Rykalá, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumír Palyza, has a gusto for this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, get votes, and for those votes they strengthen their power in the party.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just a pretext for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could call me a person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city has bought property that is strategically of great value for it.
So how do you see it further with your remaining as mayor?
The District Committee already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming: Catch a thief!
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I do not see anyone in Ostrava’s social democracy, who would initiate and promote, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Yet I am becoming uncomfortable.
I don’t read it any other way than that I’m instructing others to go through to the places they want.
Will you still fight against these efforts?
Because if this republic is to work well, political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to run the state effectively if it cannot run itself.
So I'm not thinking about leaving the ČSSD now, because I think that whoever causes cancer of this party is not me, but these people who are trying to piss me off.
We want to show that Pilsen still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team is not doing well lately, defender or midfielder Viktoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He also succeeds in shooting, he is reveling in activity, after the intervention he was ordered a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice after the victory, but in the end she took only one point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break the unpleasant series in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that we will beat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match with the North Bohemians who play offensive football.
Everything is heading towards the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent's game.
"I believe it will be an excellent match on Friday night," the Czech representative entics fans at the Doosan Arena stands.
Pilsen did not come out the last matches as she would like, but the word crisis defender Victoria rejects the word of the crisis.
That's the way it is in football, sometimes you have good form and sometimes worse again.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any way.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," the defender of the West Bohemians said.
The Victoria team will again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's on Friday night and I'd like to invite our fans, who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Defend academic freedom, this applies to both Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on open letters to students, educators and the management of secondary schools and universities in several regions to defend academic freedom from the election campaign carried out by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I have encountered more or less success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused a lecture by the honorary chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, was even retaliated in the form of a non-en invitation to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer so brave and allowed the visit of Miloš Zeman: Brno University of Technology, Grammar School Hladnov in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolín, J.E University. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
Now in Pardubice we are faced with the continuation of the promotion of politics at universities.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, the dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic capacity and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, that's not really the same as staying, for example, as the mayor of a smaller town.
Do you want to join the governors of the ČSSD, who simultaneously perform the function of a Member of Parliament and the Governor and, like them, to degrade both professions?
This is what you tell people that you can handle both these demanding functions with the left rear.
I know, we have an example of Michal Hašek, who even manages several dozen functions at once.
This is probably not an example of the person you should follow.
We also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post so that she could fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the post of Dean is that the concurrence of functions violate the apolitics of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current activity in both positions as an advantage for the University.
But you will be able to help "your" school without being a dean.
I think that your students will have a similar opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen that the voters will calculate this for you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to last long.
John Kerry admits: spying went too far!
The United States has occasionally gone "savvy far away" in spying, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the minister, the collection of information was used to avert terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington" was heard in the middle of a fierce controversy on both sides of the Atlantic, according to AFP, over the scandalous revelations of mass data surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which was also targeted by U.S. allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the president did (Barack Obama), some of these actions have gone too far and we assure you it will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended his practice so far.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent attacks such as the attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, the assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented the planes from falling, the buildings exploded and the people were murdered because we were able to be informed of the plots in time," Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far."
The affair surrounding U.S. intelligence, which reportedly watched hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans also watched the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their outrage, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States to refer or significantly restrict surveillance.
The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) have been charged before the lawsuit against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Children's Sexual Abuse Commission has learned that before charges against child educator Jonathan Lord of the city of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were indicted of child sexual abuse.
But before the commission, it was said that in its introductory statement to the commission, the association said that in their organization they had never addressed a case of sexual abuse of a child.
Chief Executive Officer Phillip Hare was asked about a case where one of the YMCA employees was charged with offences involving child pornography, and another when a Gym at Caringbah at the YMCA was convicted in 1991 for sexual harassment of the children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, an adviser to the commission, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the initial statement of YMCA was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in the YMCA organization, which valued the organization as a leading advocate of children's rights.
Evidence submitted by the Commission says that YMCA was warned that it received the second lowest of the four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society of August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him downwards himself failed when he accepted Lord without assuring himself that the staff was aware of the obligation to report violations of the rules of child safety.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys he committed during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare dismissed the allegations that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prevented personnel from reporting child safety violations by Mr. Lord.
Staff members gave evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, guarding them privately, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of the services for children at the YMCA association in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and it was often difficult to talk to him about anything."
The CEO said he did not accept evidence from the staff, that they felt uneasy if they were to contact their superiors and report the deeds.
Instead, he said their friendship with Lord obscured their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said he had told the YMCA Council in New South Wales that the lesson of Jonathan Lord's "the case of Jonathan Lord" for the organization was that the staff "did not submit any message" and the council agreed to him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have the staff signed the unsupervised agreements shortly after the allegations were made by the general manager for services to children at YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid the breach of evidence, but was "overly zealous" and poorly executed.
Professor Stephen Smallbone, a Griffith University, a child sexual abuse expert, told the committee that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, vetting, incorporation, training and staff management.
The hearing was adjourned to December 20.
President of the Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Green Savings Should Continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been struggling with a continuous decrease in the volume of contracts and the lack of interest of the state to address the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measure, save significant amounts for heating, but also a chance for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each invested billion will bring more than 2700 newly created jobs to the state.
In terms of the fiscal policy of the state, leverage and multiplier effects are significant, it is also one of the most significant pro-growth measures.
Therefore, the Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic fundamentally disagrees with the Government Resolution and asks for such steps that would allow further continuation of the program so that further calls could be announced within it.
FAA: Air transport passengers can now use technological achievements on planes (but not allowed to call from their mobile phones)
Air gamblers will be able to use their electronic devices "from gate to gate" - except calls from their mobile phones -- to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music based on the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But passengers are not expected to make changes immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary by airlines, FAA administrator Michael Huerta told a news conference.
Airlines will need to demonstrate to the FAA as their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the on-board crew training manuals and the device storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in a statement.
Passengers are currently required to shut down their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They cannot turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain does not give permission.
Passengers are expected to shut down their devices again when the plane is declining to land, and they do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft, which have been modified to enable passengers to use Wifi at a higher altitude, these criteria are expected to meet.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are securely implemented - and we will work closely with the transport companies to do so - it will be a success," Glading said in a statement.
We are tired of being “watchdogs.”
However, surfing the Internet, sending emails and sms or downloading data will continue to be banned under 3 kilometers of altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when it was, as is well known, fired from an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices as laptops will have to continue to be stored because of fears that they could hurt someone if they flitted around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national security expert in CBS News, said mobile phones continue to be seen as a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause the transmission tower interference in the air," Rosenker said.
Last month, the FAA's corporate advisory committee designed by the FAA administration to investigate the issue, proposed last month that the government allow for the wider use of electronic devices.
Pressure has been put to the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, say there is no rightful security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget the obligation to turn off their devices or ignore them.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical achievement of the time.
The new airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous-generation aircraft, but are also designed, and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resilient to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasting than there was in previous-generation devices.
For example, e-readers issue only minimal broadcasts when turning pages.
But the broadcast is stronger when the device downloads or sends data.
Among those who are pushing to ease restrictions on using these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the airline with their electronic Kindle readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem emerged.
The FAA members of the Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether these devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he was confident that the interference from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee have said that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause the interference of air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device during flying according to instruments in low visibility.
The Tourism Industry Group welcomed these changes and it is a reasonable procedure for the travelling public, which uses the technology to an abundant extent.
"We are delighted that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not in violation of safety," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that U.S. spy "has gone too far"
John Kerry hinted at the softening of the U.S. defense stance on his surveillance programs, and said in an unprecedented confession that in some cases the espionage had gone too far.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for the fact that in mind, in his inciting revelations about the NSA's spy activity, which emerged thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden, they acted as "autopilot".
The leaked information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, via a video-link at an open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have indeed learned about some of the things that were happening out of inertia, because that option was, with reference to World War II, the difficult Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11."
So he became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the line, but stressed that it had not been violated by anyone's rights.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
But Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA was seeking good and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to detonate themselves."
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly determined to murder and blow people up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented planes from falling out, buildings did not explode, and people were not executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The presiding party to the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers were preparing to Europe to respond to foreign concerns involving alleged U.S. espionage and to convince Europeans that they need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was worried about their threats to stop participating in counter-terrorism organizations because they are dislodged by the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national and security interests of the US, it is indeed important that Europe stays with us in the same boat, with regard to the joint efforts to combat terrorism, Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the presiding partisan subcomitance of foreign relations on European affairs, said in an interview from Washington, Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the presiding panel of foreign relations on European affairs.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate with terrorism, regardless of their rage over NSA programs.
Reports in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some U.S. allies, even though the agency chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another revelation quoted by Snowden as saying that the NSA had tracked German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and up to 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the allied espionage as necessary and said it was a common issue from both sides.
Amid the turmoil of Murphy, he said his office was planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year, and he hopes members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other legislators who intend to engage are to be published.
He said the program is still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the road aims to help repair relations, he added that “good-induced educational measures” would also be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people in terms of spy programs that they themselves have been using for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to realize the fact that we are not the only ones doing espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading as planned to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to the animosity that the US strategy has triggered in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
For the words "Mugabe is a limp" no longer in prison, the court abolishes the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to be careful about the public talking about the eighty-nine-year-old Mugab, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and since the end of 1987, then he has been at the forefront of it.
According to Section 33 of the Criminal Code, a fine of $100 was threatened with imprisonment for the disparaging of the presidency.
"State prosecutors should not zealously blame people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal the court's decision, the BBC reported.
A number of the damaged Zimbabweans were vocally opposed to the law, among them Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist, who was involved in public, ended up in prison with a "bally donkey."
In August, the prosecutor charged a twenty-six-year-old man for his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting the freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later prove to be false," Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala said.
Until now, the right of Zimbabwe allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to twenty years in prison.
"The existence of a law allowing to criminalize someone for a false statement has a freezing effect on the right to express themselves freely," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil liberties on the basis of a referendum.
A small steps away from the dictation of one man's man took place in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought to the prime minister's chair Morgan Tsvangirai.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and the highest inflation in the world until 2008, exceeding 100 000 percent.
In 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe is paid only by the currencies of other countries.
The imperfect economy is at the expense of Mugabe's insoluble agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with the running of the farms.
Young couple outsped to live with their parents, the new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given as an assignment to design a house on a plot of land that lies on the corner of two streets, with the land itself sloping somewhat.
The demand also stated that two generations will live in the house, which would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separate space.
The younger couple needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
Therefore, the architects decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"When creating the design, we respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"Three different functions of the house are connected in several ways through the exterior of the building, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their privacy," the designers explain.
The household of parents is at the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognized from the outside, because they differ in various final modifications of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been shaped using panels from the planks, the part where the office is plastered is plastered and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very interconnected with the exterior.
The household of parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues into the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climbs the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to fall through them cascades.
It is this is where the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique to it.
The household of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with a sliding door.
Living area with dining and kitchen part in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the highest floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the lobby, and then rises up the staircase.
Fire brigades have arrived to rescue the lost puppy, who was stranded 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry
Cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was caught in a quarry by a man who was walking a dog.
Firefighters rapped on the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was freed by fire units, who came to rescue him after somehow imprisoned himself on a dangerous protrusion in a stone quarry of 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby ran after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days on Wednesday until he was rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) with his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
After fled when he got into a small accident, they franticly searched for their lost dog and placed challenges on social media.
On Wednesday at about 14.15, the aurcering dog walker of the stranded Ruby at a protrusion in a quarry of 15 meters above the ground, saw.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station hurried to the scene and rappelled down to free Ruby, using a animal transport bag to pick him up the rock.
Expert commander of the technical rescue team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He did not move his eyes during the rescue – he was totally frozen.
But he's all right now.
Then he got the biscuits.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is unbelievable.
Expert commander of the technical rescue team Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “Looking at the rescue operation, I was scared.”
Above all, I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It was amazing to keep him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he had exhausted himself too much and collapsed, he would probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, everyone was just tremendous.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid he could fall, but he stayed there."
The firefighters were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
In the industrial complex of ČKD in Prague burned down at night cooling tower
A large-capacity reservoir was burning in the ČKD industrial complex in Prague, according to firefighters, probably a cooling tower.
"The firefighters were leaving for the fire on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, this morning they were still extinguishing the fire," Prague fire spokeswoman Pavlína Adamcová said.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the vicinity according to the measurements did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the cause of the fire are still unknown.
Approximately five dozen firefighters gradually arrived in the area in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a fire in a large-capacity tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamcová said.
"The area does not contain a functional hydrant network, so we are extinguishing using transport lines from tankers," she added.
According to news server tn.cz, the extinguishing of a poorly functioning network of hydrants complicated, so firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The fire chief fired the fire alarm.
There are four steps in total, in the most serious situations the fourth is announced.
Chemists also went to the scene to verify the level of dangerous substances that could have come into the air during the fire.
"They did not measure in the air a number of pollutants that exceeds hygiene standards," a fire department spokeswoman said.
$325 million bailout package for Tasmania health care
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for the moribund health service in Tasmania contain harsh conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibers said the Australian Union is taking “quick-ups” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing island population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years has been decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilki.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that, we believe, will solve the specific problems facing the state," Ms. Plibers said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for operations at the request of a patient.
A further 2600 operations including orthopedic operations and cataract surgery will help eliminate indebtedness.
The money is also for freely accessible clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better postoperative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and providing personal electronic health records in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the ideas that leading clinical doctors told me to help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," Ms Plibers said.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting regime and registration obligation.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the money of the Australian Union, and to inform monthly of where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be established to ensure that the state supplies services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be useless "until real reform follows in order to lay a more sustainable foundation of the Tasmanian public health system."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for expedited assistance, which he first carried out in negotiations with the prime minister in early May.
"I believe that the federal auxiliary package can free the public health of the state of health from a critical state," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Federal Opposition spokeswoman Peter Dutton believes today's statement is just a "patch."
"The reason I'm here is that the Labour government has taken $430 million out of our health system," he told ABC.
You can't have a government that's going to take away nearly half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union, which donates $300 million, and pretend it's good news.
Mr Dutton urged Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar from the rescue package will be spent on a higher bureaucracy.
Music plays in the subway on the Bridge
Transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the Music in Metro project.
The first vestibule, where the reproduced instrumental music plays continuously during the metro operation, is the Můstek line A at the ascent to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghettos, they are supposed to ease tensions
Police specialists should work in ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half of their errands here.
They would keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior is counting on this.
According to him, the "accelerated provision of social housing" would mainly help to improve the situation in the country.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 slums and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people in them, mainly Roma.
Adults in ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
There was usury.
Experts of problem locations meanwhile, there have been a hundred.
Relations between their inhabitants and others are exacerbated.
Anti-Romani marches were held in several places.
The extremists were also joined by people around the country.
According to the interior, security and order are difficult for the police in areas with ghettos.
The essential condition is the "consistent application of equal access in law enforcement".
However, it is not possible to achieve this without detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go to errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In the troubled location, he would oversee order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or offenses.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of illegal acts," the interior said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive surcharges, up to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers into troubled areas is to be paid from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, funds 85 percent.
Preparations have begun this year, now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is scheduled to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the authors of the report said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer should be given by an analysis that will determine the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money for these members the police will be able to release annually after the end of the project.
According to the design of the project, the selected police officers first undergo an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should go through this training every year.
Of them, the most suitable candidates will come.
Special education for police officers who will operate in the ghettos should also be created.
According to the authors, social housing would mainly help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet hostels with precisely defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
Social housings would have a higher standard, which would be comparable to normal housing.
Tenants would have to comply with an integration plan that would be drawn up by social workers.
They would have to follow the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain themselves and actively seek work.
If they were to try to integrate, they would have advanced to a higher standard of housing.
According to the interior, the permeable housing system should operate for at least 30 years until the next generation grows "in a pro-integration-motivated environment".
The social housing model is prepared by resorts for local development and work.
They are to propose it by the end of the year.
Together with Bárta, an inspection and an anti-corruption police analyst arrested
Information about Vít Bárta’s arrest began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was reported by Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon discovered that the case was taken care of by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS), its people were supposed to arrest Barta in the center of Prague.
It happened in front of the Four Seasons.
The inspection solves cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its jurisdiction also applies to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - the head of analysts and informatics, is one of the arrests among those arrested.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
However, Jaroslav Ibehej, a spokesman for the anti-corruption police, declined to comment on the information, adding that the media must turn to GIBS on this issue.
Even her spokeswoman for the inspection, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case, she immediately referred to the Municipal Public Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office.
Also, from this vague reaction, it can be inferred that the event took place, but is in a secrecy regime that does not allow the speakers to say anything concrete.
Bárta’s lawyer Oldřich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represents Bárta "even in this matter", but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bart's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart's arrest could be related to former police president, Petr Lessy.
He was promoted to the post by Bart, together with former VV chairman Radek John, who was at the head of the Interior Ministry.
The dispute that broke out between ex-premier Petr Nečas and VV even had to deal with then-President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this connection came from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I really don't know anything about the matter," Lessy told iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, but Bárta was the real head of the party at the time.
Barta now ran for the elections for the Úsvit movement, his parliamentary mandate escaped only narrowly - by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what it is.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our list and, as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomio Okamura," said Okamura, who before the elections said that he gave Bárta space to run for Dawn, because he helped him solve the problem of executors.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former VV co-partner Jaroslav Škárka.
Foreign workers with visa rights may undergo a test of "legitimacy"
As the government intends to consider expanding police interventions, it is considering a test of “legitimacy” for foreign workers with a visa license of 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria in order to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fulfil unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion paper was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australian neighbors.
"The loud statements 'foreigners at the end of the front' and 'work first for Australians' are a very unpleasant remnant of when unions demanded a protected labour market," she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that white labor should have been protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if anyone in the region had noticed an echo of this historic artifact.
The discussion paper discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he's negotiating with officials for human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the others are left to consider.
If the criteria of ‘legitimacy’ are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking.
After previous experience with businesses intending to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds of them, businesses may also require the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka, who sought asylum, died with a suspected heart attack after arriving on a shelter on the Christmas Islands this week.
The man's nine-year-old terrified son traveled to Australia along with him and was comforted after his father's death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on a boat.
Australian authorities rushed to a hospital in the Christmas Islands where he died.
Israeli military planes attack target in Syria, says responsible official
Israeli military warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port of Laziqiya on Thursday night, Fox News's responsible administration official confirmed.
This responsible official did not specifically say what the goal was, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press news agency reports that the target was SA-125 missiles of Russian production.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out an airstrike on the supply of rockets in Syria.
She moved from the villa to the block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of Prague’s most beautiful residential areas in Ořechovka.
However, the original owners of the house recovered it in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance payment.
Ivana was therefore quickly looking for alternative housing for herself and her older mother.
From the apquerades she received a tip for an apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor on the large forest park and the dam excited me on the other side," Ivana recalls of the first impression.
At first I thought it would be a makeshina for about three years.
"Today we have lived here for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction I would not change," adds the owner.
At that time, the mother and daughter moved from a hundred and twenty-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and gave away almost all the equipment.
The action was not easy, the things were stored with friends, and the gradual furnishing took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but the necessary modifications had to take place, such as painting doors or replacing windows.
The previous owner crashed the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and unnecessarily large hallway, and vice versa, a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to define the individual zones and the division of the room, which allowed the new placement of lights.
The first intervention she decided after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to partially improving the standard was replacing the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana didn’t know what to do with the bathroom.
I've been taking home magazines for years looking for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
On the recommendation, I approached the young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step for the future," Ivana says.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, the layout of the hallway was also adjusted.
The architect combined the space of the toilet and bathroom and replaced two doors with the opening wings with one sliding, thus saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also barrier-free enough.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, at the toilet bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Douděrovová continued.
As part of the program How to build the dream took place a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room, in which architect Martin Čeněk also participated.
Into the space, which was created by combining two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classical principles of optical cutting, for example, semi-trips or Japanese walls.
"In the end, this would violate the openness and uniformity of the space," explains the architect.
It was originally separated by sleeping and living area.
It was enough to turn two sofas back to each other and build a custom-made cabinet for duvets between them.
The dining area is defined by shades of floor and painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used a quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived with wallpaper with a pattern.
If necessary, the kitchen corner is covered with sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor made of anti-allergic marmolea has a number of advantages over the previous laminate: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of alcoves and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted by color is a demonstration of how to work with space in the block of flats.
I left the colors to the architects, I wished it would be joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The cladding made of graphoglass with the motif of a blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
For a warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, we managed to store books, among other things, in the space under the windowsill.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably operated remotely.
In the transformed interior, the new contrast with the older one works excellently, for example, with a decades-old crystal chandelier and with high-quality art objects that Ivana has been collecting all her life.
The last one came the kitchen.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides, and the owner felt a little bit like in a tunnel.
The architect reduced their number and moved the layout.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white area softens the slightly pearly surface.
Thanks to the imaginative solution, the washer and dishwasher, can be fitted into the small space.
The appearance of the small kitchen was revitalised by the all-glass wall covering above the worktop.
Unique graph glass with digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is excellently maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia, which remind her of the favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here, too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiling.
The large shower has a glass door to Ronal.
The task was to create a clear simple space from the environment, in which the functions and devices will be in harmony.
We have unified the interior materially and colorfully and attempted its elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
"Another condition for the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the availability of everyday items," adds Kamila Douděrová.
Minister Holcát reinstated the position of Head Sister for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, the number of which in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalized so that the nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always contact if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be given due attention from the Ministry as well.
In the exercise of this profession, not only high professional professionalism, but also a human approach and personal beliefs are needed.
"I will gladly and with all responsibility try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who, with their approach to patients, do not help us to perform their call-up with all empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the eyes of the public," says Alena Šmídová.
Alena Šmídová, the newly appointed Head Nurse for the Czech Republic, said on the occasion of her inauguration that she wants to deal with various aspects of the job of a nurse and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, educaters, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I fundamentally do not want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, each with their competences and together with other healthcare professionals form a well-coordinated work team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the exercise of the profession of sisters, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical records.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks of the nurse unnecessarily burden and take away the time they could and should give them prefer to give to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas on which it intends to focus include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate with each other in the team and with the management of health service providers, adjustment of competencies, as also labour law issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or not overloading their lack of numbers at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous stories, but for fear of possible recourse, are not documented on a specific case where violations of the rules might occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, so the function of the Head of the Czech Republic could serve in this case as a guarantee of maintaining the anonymity of such a complaint and to have the specific case examined by the competent authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in Nurse (graduating in 1978) and the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague in the study programme Nursing - Pedagogy (graduating in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been the head of the Department of Nursing and Other Non-medical Disciplines and Recognition of Qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bedside in an internal department, she also worked as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also a statutory deputy headmistress for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the main nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, she devoted herself to lecturing activities in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of a political party.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted the novel by Denis Diderot, which brings an exceptional film quest and accompreation of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in the 60's of the 18th century in France and tells the gloomy story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent by her family to a monastery.
When he rebels, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a criminally perverted mother superior and for others becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips into lust or sensationalism, and that's its problem.
The erectile character of this story leads to the fact that even the audience will experience torturing similar to wearing a weighted shirt.
Jana Pét'ová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap - a jump a few years back, to my memories, to my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like, not having any worries and just coming home from school and washing dishes, vacuuming and doing tasks.
Although these "obligations", it was mostly just a theory, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - to come home from school, throw the bag in the corner and run out.
Playing with other kids ball games, jumping a shot.
Then, during the series Helena and her boys embroider with a chain stitch, a festive tablecloth for her grandmother for her birthday.
And only then, after several warnings, finally wash the dishes, vacuum, in winter to put the wood into the tiled stoves and do the tasks after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of tasks to write love verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, have breakfast of homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not those jams that are sold now, the contents of which did not lie next to the strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which my mom and I liked to collect so much.
I also remember those magical evenings when it was the grave silence in the room when my sister and I recorded songs from the radio on cassettes that were filming loudly in my mom's old tape recorder.
And then we flipped the tapes on the pencil and played the same song over and over again, our favorites, and they toasted with a siphon.
Or we were on the phone across the table using cans that were tied to each other with a string - and while we're on the phone call to hear better, it was necessary to clean your ears thoroughly, the then earshed was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live in such a way that we did not miss anything.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPads or even mobile phones and laptops or designer clothes.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation, and the best "necture" in the wardrobe was a batik T-shirt of homemade production with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics we were satisfied with the aforementioned mom's tapestrip man and at most so Walkman, which we shared with my sister and, by the way, which, by the way, we used only on the train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Klobíček Hop or man, don't be angry, or as I've already said to go "just" out.
When I was a little older we got a video player under the tree, surely my parents saved for him for a long time, but unfortunately he did not warm up with us for a long time.
My younger sister put strudel into him, she said he was so beautifully stinging the cassettes, so she tried to see if he was sleeping with strudel.
Unfortunately, he was sleeping, but it was his last bite.
Well, and he still has this incident, poor, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she put strudel into the video and thought she would play the recipe and not play it, so she still can't bake it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate with each other, to communicate without a cell phone, a computer.
Together with my sister, we agreed on the holidays with the neighbor's granddaughter, when we will meet again next summer at the grandmother's - and that's the way it was, that's the way it was true.
We're together.
Now promise someone to see each other in a year?!
I also remember the winter when we were running outside with the whole village, building snowmen, riding a snowy hill near the church on bags stuffed with hay.
Then, together with the whole family, we had dinner and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I heard the notorious sentence before each dinner: "Leave your hands!"
Yes, this is still true today, but you certainly do not have a cotton soap tied to the tap in the lemon mesh.
After dinner, when my dad was "working" in the garage over the beer with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay down on the floor, leaned our legs against the tiled stove, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the cracking of wood, which came from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together - we spoke - we didn't write messages every day through various chats, text messages.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew much more about ourselves.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I add these memories by viewing albums where they are easily glued with black corners of black and white photos.
And if I didn’t know how much I was then, a year of taking the picture is always written from the back of the photo.
I see that although the haircuts didn't suit us very well according to the pot and we had pants after the cousin two numbers larger, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back by that step forward - to reality.
Until 2013 and I will wait to see what modern times will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now for the young teenage generation so at least somewhere "one hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they lose a lot, that they will not experience this "pre-monitor" time either.
I wish that for them!
They have to save, young Czechs know.
Most of them do not even know what interest
More and more Czechs are setting their money aside.
However, they do not reach the savings champions in the region.
The most money is set aside by Austrians, who save an average of 181 euros per month.
A little more than Czechs are saving even people in Slovakia.
This is according to a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving and two-thirds of respondents plan to put aside more money.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking of savers, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little savings products.
For example, almost every second Serb saves at home "under the pillow" according to the survey.
This year, the number of those who save higher amounts have increased in the Czech Republic this year.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents put a thousand to 2.5 thousand crowns on various types of savings every month, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly deposit in year-on-year comparison fell slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, compared to last year, interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly.
Only 16% of respondents use them, compared to almost a quarter of people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what returns they are achieving on individual products.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how interest their money is.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their deposited money, 73 percent of respondents know this among people over fifty years.
In the international comparison of the Erste Group, Czechs lead the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12 percent distance.
Australian woman appeals against stay in Thai prison
A twenty-one-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to a fifteen-day prison on the island of Phuket, falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally 15. June charged with a provincial court on the island of Phuket on the island of Phuket with perjury when Thai police said the taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly detained her, assaulted her in the morning on Sunday 10. June.
However, the footage from industrial television later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Police from Phuket Island conducted talks with Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the incident.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security correctional facility on the periphery in Phuket instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Evidently it's a difficult time, but we hope he'll come back to us as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail of 50 000 baht.
Reports from Australia say she has spent a holiday in the recreation area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but was warned that the appeal could lead to legal proceedings that her sentence will increase and result in adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of the Australian travel agency employee Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also try to correct a tarnished picture for tourists, which may have been behind the acquittal.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Lyricist Michal Horáček brought not only his brand new double CD Czech calendar to the hall of the Kolín Municipal Social House, but especially in the program Between Us singers Lenka Nová, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Matěj Benko Orchestra.
After the opening intro and the acting etude of the delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story about how they last played in Cologne and in the theater and in the whole city evoked electric current.
"Otherwise, they produced two kinds of cards in Cologne, with which I came into contact a lot," he recalled.
He also reminded President Zeman.
"Perhaps we could take a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravka near Bratislava," he quipped about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening Horáček, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical achievement.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, but at that time there was no idea how we meet in those squares and chanting who does not jump, is not a Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech calendar, but we won't play it for you today," he entertained.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang a lot of suitable Sleep for him from this album, sing at night and accompanied himself to guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band in the composition of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang a little clip into the hillside of the heart seated, which immediately stirred the auditorium.
"I'm glad you were intrigued by the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček responded.
After the remembrance of Petr Hapka, I Recognize the performance of František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller rewarded with a huge applause, Hana Hegerová was recalled by the song Dad liked Lída Baarová with Horáček’s explanation about the communist ban and the replacement of Baarová by the American actress Mae Westová.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the composition Sebastián, Segrado then sang a beautiful composition Prague musicalized by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Zásmický and a former Kolinek.
But that was the conclusion, standing applause and the addition in the form of an optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
There was another addition to the playlist, but the fans did not applaud.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four of them sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček’s books and even the cover from the legendary LP and with potential candidates, she took a picture.
Recently, CEZ CEO announced that he is postponing the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th units of the Temelín power plant at the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and the approval of the Contracts of the Difference by the government.
These reasons are trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, for the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give the shareholders a recommendation and not hide behind him.
Clive Palmer Says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over parental leave program
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest because of the parental leave program because his daughters can conceive and benefit from it.
The Mining tycoon, who is in a dispute over the payment of a $6 million coal tax assessment, made this claim when he tried to sweep off the table the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a vital role in deciding whether to levy coal and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in a conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could have been personally benefited from the policy.
"She has been in a great conflict of interest in terms of paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters became pregnant, he would be directly interested in getting parental leave," said Mr Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winners in the fight for the Fairfax precinche next to the Sunshine Coast district with 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for an election to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the polls closed?
"We have to have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come, tap details to the computer, vote immediately and have results at half past seven in the evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballot papers.
Is the point that the results can be erased if someone doesn’t like it?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion, together with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said his policy program also applies to the airport in the Sunshine Coast area and that he would take his new job "very seriously."
The public office is a public service.
"We don't seek any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the imministeration of the new Civil Code and the Business Corporations Act on 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the company's representatives surveyed said they had not addressed the issues related to both key codes in their company at all.
This is according to a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the approaching effective date of both key codes, only at the last minute are a number of managers starting to realize the significant impact on the business of their companies.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the lavish of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty whether revolutionary changes will eventually occur or not.
"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left to switch to the new right for their companies without complications," Jan Spáčil, Ambruz & Dark Deloitte's partner, commented on the results.
Of the 61 percent, intensively engaged in the new laws, 26 percent said their firms had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
In addition, 35 percent of the companies in this number are going to take the necessary measures in the near future.
One in five companies has not yet dealt with reconducting, yet they have a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent do not have an opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that they have not yet addressed the issues related to recodification.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is for the largest number of companies surveyed, the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), followed by the solution of business conditions (16 percent) and changes in the cadastre of real estate and in liability for damage (after ten percent).
Contracts will take place one of the most important innovations of the entire recodification, i.e. the unification of the modification of contracts only under the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will cease to exist, as a result of which the contractual law should become clearer for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom of relations," said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal attorney Lukáš Poddaný.
In connection with the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
Furthermore, the topics related to changes in the convocation and progress of the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent) follow.
The new legislation means tightening the obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially in a situation where a company is threatened with or is incapable of bankruptcy.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the boards of directors and the executives of the companies do not act with the care of a proper manager and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit gained for the performance of the office only in the last two years," Spáčil added.
NSA revelations increase state social paranoiolin
One peaceful day as of the end of August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the U.S. Consular Office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), a German domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the U.S. forward patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV office hoped to be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, and this action triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, insisted in September that the United States was not using its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in favor of American companies and strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profit."
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant as an informant, has begun revealing his valuable collection from secret surveillance by the United States, European governments, and leading businessmen no longer know if they should trust the director's words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was espionage at a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data that U.S. cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia has achieved state surveillance of new proportions.
The last straw came with revelations that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been eavesdropped on for ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then even leading entrepreneurs are certainly potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence and companies more transparent.
I would say it is possible that this data is used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, a company that represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a poll issued in July by the EY consulting service, German companies are convinced that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the U.S. now poses the same big risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in the entire documentation revealed by Mr Snowden that the United States has handed over the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and the Internet capabilities, saying it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical of this.
There are voices from the German parliament that we should make a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies revealed by Snowden is for some companies that have so far believed that China poses the greatest threat from surveillance, yet shocking.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European officials have more widely realised that the data stored in the U.S. falls under the jurisdiction there and is therefore potentially countervainable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members after the revelation of the US Prism program for data mining, canceled plans to use a cloud provider based in the U.S.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP CEOs, says: “We have a new question for customers that wasn’t here a year ago – where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction?”
Many German executives argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is not a surprise.
It always happened.
“This has been a major issue for many years and it hasn’t changed significantly even during the current debate,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
Americans are espionage on us at the commercial and industrial level, just as we do we espionage on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to boast of the countermeanor they have made in order not to give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been reminded that taking a free memory USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a meeting in order not to be used as a listening device.
The German BfV advises executives to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk that smartphones can be embezzled.
Subscription mobile phones will then be dissipated.
But there is a concern that SMEs will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against an unauthorized approach,” he said.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionaging from other countries.
According to the Washington post, the US National Intelligence Estimate documents reported France alongside Russia and Israel in the second season of perpetrators involved in hacking for economic correspondents, just behind China.
A member of the council in a German risk-free society concluded that in terms of economic espionage, “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France's internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in a month's talks this month: "The services know quite well that all countries, even when they are working together to fight terrorism, are expropriating on their allies."
New Nicocin Disease Can Take away Smoking Enjoyment
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
The only dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before the human trials, it is necessary to carry out additional tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We firmly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhaust all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong to overcome all current approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information to create anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to form a smooth stream of these antibodies.
Antibodies persecute all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine hit.
During the tests of the vaccinated mice, to which nicotine was additionally delivered, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that weren't vaccinated "cayed," the researchers said, a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translation Medicineal.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given as often as to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they proved to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower because they convert liver cells into factories to produce antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they feel like trying a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
However, it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to stop.
"They'll know if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that's going to help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists have said the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
The desperate cry of Obama's voter
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
Says Obama's sincere efforts have thwarted the obstruction of the Republican Party
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the woes of Obama's health care website or drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris has been studying medicine at Harvard for the second year.
I'm reading a sad book these days.
I thought about this book that would encourage me during the sloppy days of my second year at medical school and restore me a bit of hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's about memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish patient testimonials in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and the speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelming predominance, and television news forced us to reflect on the historical value of the moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents were hiding the newspaper they had found.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
During his inauguration in 2008, Obama had the support of 82 percent.
And I'm closing the book here.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of the missed opportunities.
In the years after I dropped my first ballot paper, there were actually changes.
It was definitely nothing I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse achievements – from the law on affordable care through the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of politics “not to ask for anything, not to say anything” after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I am convinced that party obstructions have reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is an immigration reform, the possibility of public choosing health care and closing the base in Guantnám.
But after many situations where I defended the Obama administration in front of colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of explanations that they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
Obstructions of Republicans cannot explain the approval of eavesdropping on foreign leaders or airstrikes of drones that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained by the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, nor that it is persecuting those who uncover the wrong actions of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a proper trial or for restricting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive ... from the Nixon administration."
And most recently, they cannot excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if something like this could be expected.
Whether I should have suspected at the age of 18 that government power could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected function clearly does not have a predictable course, and our public talks will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to a large extent to be the result of the administration’s own decision.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a grievous and unbalanced alternative, and it seemed he could not consolidate his policies or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we once heard of.
Yet the return to 2008 – as Obama’s support fell below 45% this week – is getting harder through this book.
It makes me remember that line of promises that have faded.
This week I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat to Clinton during the Primaries in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our spell back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this commentary are exclusively the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Business and marketing ŠkoFIN is led by Abrahamek
Its competencies include the area of product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Luděk Šantora.
Abraham has been linked to the automotive sector for the past 14 years of his professional career.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, then at Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealers for seven years.
His last job was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for more than five years.
ŠkoFIN was founded in 1992.
Syria destroys its means for the production of chemical weapons, says overseeing body
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions with poisonous gas, the Global Oversight Committee on Chemical Weapons said on Thursday, while violent conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the locations where poisonous substances are expected to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also said that more than 120 000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before November 1,
the term that the organisation established in The Hague established Damascus to destroy or prevent the operation of all equipment for the production of chemical weapons and machinery for the mixing of chemicals in order to create poison gas and refuel.
Completing this essentially the initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons including the yoperite and the nerve gas of sarin.
The announcement came as fighting in the city of Saphira raged on Thursday, which experts refer to as the headquarters of a chemical weapons and storage factory, according to the Syrian Observer for Human Rights, UK-based Syrian Observer.
A group of activists that monitored the total death toll through a network of activists in Syria announced on Thursday that 120 296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the governing party, there are 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar al-Assad, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Among those killed are also 2 202 government defectors and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
Day 25. In July, the UN organization estimated that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's forces fought in Saphira against the rebels, many of whom have been associated with Al Qaeda, for weeks.
The observer said Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but it did not have specific numbers.
The fighting underlined the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, on their mission, when they are supposed to rid Syria of chemical arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war, have to deal with tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which closely cooperates with the United Nations, it was said that his team was now "hall satisfied that he has verified - and has been following the destruction - of Syria's declared essential equipment for production and mixing.
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification papers when they visited 21 of the 23 locations declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two places due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were "abandoned and ... the items of the chemical weapons program it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were checked."
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan to destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW executive committee next month.
"I bow to the courage and bravery you showed in fulfilling this most demanding mission ever that the organization has ever had," said Ahmet Uzumcu's observer director in a commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government, with their security forces, full of members of the Alawite sect, are opposed to each other in the civil war, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the head of the Observeratorial, Rami Abdul Rahman, said there was a heavy explosion on Wednesday inside the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lázikiy.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Gazprom Alexei Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria launches new gas era
The launch of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom’s director said.
“Today we are witnessing a milestone: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian exports through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russian gas to Europe, adds on the riskiness of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that direct links to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" removed.
Once the whole project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is to begin in other countries in the direction of the flow later this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Early puberty: Advanced Earlier
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is coming
It is not proven that hormones or other chemicals are behind it
Experts say that one of the triggers of an earlier puberty may be an obesity epidemic.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so evident in boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
Should the mother be frightened when her daughter begins to grow breasts and hair on the shaming at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatricians this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time trying to assure my parents that it's usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, hair on the sham and armpits and body odors, appear in girls earlier.
In the last forty years, however, there has been only a small shift at the age when the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, it is now an average age of 12.5 years, compared to the age of 12.75 in 1970.
“When the breasts start to develop, at least two to three years pass before the first menstruation occurs,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
There is a debate about what activates the actual beginning of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered "prematurely advanced."
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which can be carefully monitored by pediatricians.
Faster growth may be a reason for the endocrinologist to conduct tests to eliminate serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones, which can eventually lead to a cessation of growth and dwarf in adulthood.
Recommendations on drugs and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocialic aspects are also important.
When it comes to taking medication, Kaplowitz is cautious, but recognizes that "suppressing puberty can alleviate problems with the girl's behavior and her feelings that she differs from her peers."
What is understandable is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried that he can get pregnant or how he's going to handle hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter began to have her period at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no coherent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual message in the media are to blame.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the most serious reason is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9, which combines body fat with the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, the patterns of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions through the climate to genes.
Another riddle: Although boys have a hair of their faces and awe at a young age, the trend towards the full flowering of early puberty is not as obvious as it is for girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Children's Doctors (AAP) conference have added more complexities to the subject.
Acne and hairy are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful when it comes to how we identify the actual onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean having to talk to a child sooner than you’d expect,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child is likely to respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need assurances that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15 000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous Kalamon region.
According to further detailed reports, Israel destroyed Hezbollah missiles in Wednesday's airstrikes on two sites in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the military.
Her program is also the fight against Israel, which is not meddled in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of armaments to the hands of Hezbollah into Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday's Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria are yet to be clarsed.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but was confirmed by U.S. sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean region have been hit by Syrian Missile base Snoubar Jabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya reports that two warehouses were hit in which the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, they were missiles of the Russian production of the SA-8.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Jishai said Syria was continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with rockets, and the Syrian air force teaches members of the Hezbollah armed section to handle missiles.
The SA-8s are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a movable chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions, they can be easily hidden.
They are equipped with radar, but it turns off after the missile is fired, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in an area inninded with the ruling alawites.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He says it helps protect the Syrian Shia community to which the alawites belong.
Now 15 000 of his fighters are reportedly ready to help conquer the army back Calamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalamun is located between Damascus and Homs's third-largest city.
The battle is due to be retaliation by an opposition's recent attack on the headquarters of Syria's Shiite brigade, Abu Fadel Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to win back the city of Kusair near the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the insurgents from Kusair went to Calamun.
He claims that Maliki has a large share in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be partly also the part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Sobotka is negotiating for the CSSD.
Social-Democracy crumbling, the People's Party and the Babišovs talk to each other and are preparing a common course of action.
If the Social Democrats are gone within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly coordinated partners who put on the table a ready-made list of demands, including ministerial posts.
ČSSD envoys will either swallow acidic coalition grapes or nod to the fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days of being carried on a wave of sympathy, he first stumbled.
Yesterday he failed to dominate the political committee and, above all, to force convicted liars to resign.
Only he is the confirmed negotiator for the party, the other members of the team will be allowed only after a key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚV).
I apologized to the members of the board and now the citizens.
You should not lie, in personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hašek said after a meeting of the closest leadership of the Social Democrats.
He added that he was not clinging to the post of the first vice-president.
"I will communicate my decision on November 10 at the ÚVV," Hašek said.
Vice-Chairman of the ČSSD Zdeněk Škromach and the head of the parliamentary group Jeroným Tejc spoke similarly.
He said he was elected just two days ago.
Both MPs then said they would do everything to make the fifty-member ČSSD club one voice.
Michal Hašek put the crown on the absurd theatre by the sentence: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I respected the decisions of party bodies."
Another lie live.
Or perhaps, during a call for Sobotka’s resignation and his elimination from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August Central Committee of the First Committee decided with 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka is the candidate of the party for prime minister?
However, the head of the ČSSD, by convening the Central Committee, did not make a powerful army of enemies until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with a bunch of sorts of gossip and rumors, or to recall the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
Dipperwear will be washed powerfully, there will be signs of dark alliances between coal-baron Zdeněk Bakala and Sobotka's wing.
There will be a friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorný.
Disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD will be provoked.
The warnings are the words of the Mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka’s ally, Petr Kajnar: “I signed Charter 77 so that the country is not ruled by idiots.”
If the Central Institute had met already this weekend, liars would probably be forced to sacrificate their functions.
The traitors sprinkles their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning head of the ČSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
UN celebrates new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work without delay on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “sustainable development goals” to replace MDGs, the validity of which expires in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said overnight that now is the time to "fall above national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over a process to establish the general SDG goals," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the sustainable development goals that builds on the success of MDG.
Babiš: The government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create one at all.
The ANO chairman admitted this in an interview for Právo, which will be published tomorrow.
Putin Promises Environmental Olympiad, Plan Kept Him by Giant Secret Landfills
Winter sports fans are already cutting the meter until the opening of the Sochi Olympics, others are looking at their preparation with increasing fears.
The Russian Olympics, although it will not start until February, is facing another scandal.
The Russians do not seem to be able to fulfill the promise that the preparations and holding of the Games will not disturb nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will go in four months.
After all, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had the bar built very high, the Canadian Games were the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
But it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to hold games with "zero waste" has long since taken over.
Last week, AP reporters discovered a giant landfill of building material in the village of Akhstyr near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulating foams was found by environmentalists in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have disappeared and the landfill.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters had a glimp on a landfill the size of three football pitches.
It is not the only one, several have been created in the area of such places, the British newspaper The Times described.
Russian Railways, a state monopoly is working on the site, which builds a roughly sixty-kilometre journey between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
The company, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways defended themselves that someone from subcontractors had set up a landfill.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Akhtyr, around the village for three months and nights, trucks full of waste material have been running around the village.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymtu, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
"Water from here contaminates the Sochi water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," Vladimir Kimayev of the environmental non-profit organization EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizing committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
By comparison, the Sochi games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics cost $43 billion.
Last year's London Games cost only 19 billion and the Vancouver-Nantix billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will eventually be enough snow, there were also reports that human rights are not respected while working at the exhibition of sports venues and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers slammed his mouth in protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also worried about how Russian organizers cope with a new law during the Games that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment on the plane will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will still need to shut down their tablets and smartphones during launch and landing, regardless of changes in the U.S. to ease regulations regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies room to change their practices, so passengers will be able to read e-books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical stages of flight if the devices remain in "airline" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but it annoys many people that they can not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a large piece of work from U.S. carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices at critical stages of flight are still in force in Australia.
"The CSA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices on the aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained all the time and that passengers are acting in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from the crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its wi-fi in-finger entertainment system, has been inclined to change, but announced that it will submit to the regulator's decision.
"We would welcome it if CASA had an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices because we really think that it would improve customer experiences now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment) it would improve customer experiences," the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will stick to the current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is such that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that anytime soon," he said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
But we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area that can be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the FAA’s decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of air carriers from the USA, the impact of the regulations will be different from the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as revitalising manuals, training material, hand luggage and passenger information.
"Once an airline confirms its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders passengers to switch off during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier device be safely stored under the seats during take-off and descent or in the storage space overhead.
Nonsense in the film Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from space Gravity sold cinemas in the Czech Republic some time after the premiere.
According to the Union of Film Distributors, almost 150 thousand viewers saw it in October and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews rate the film positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
Lidovky.cz asked astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity included, although it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice Sandra Bullock hair, which somehow does not float in a state of weightlessness.
The Hubb Space Telescope and the International Space Station move along significantly different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film reproach the unrealistic effect and the whole behavior of the fire in a state of weightlessness.
The suits would not have taken such blows, too.
Heroes in the film Gravity often come into conflict with various items, and suits without much difficulty everything lasts.
Criticism was not spared even the plot.
Such a large-scale tragedy in Earth's orbit is unrealistic, according to some debaters.
In addition, it wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People are also arguing about the "unreal" behavior of ropes on the forums.
It is said to be designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Observatory and Planetarium of the Capital City. Prague): I have only seen it on a wide screen, but I can say unequivocally, I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary movie, it was science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost an obligation) not to adhere consistently to reality.
"Further than the inconsistency mentioned, I was touched by how the space station with degrading level of technology (the last Chinese) is shown three times."
"It won't be Chinese until the end of the decade, and it's probably going to look better than it is in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors try not to violate the laws of physics very successfully, and so the natural-oriented viewer appreciates that in various cosmic collisions and precipitation quite rightly preserves the momentum, in the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from space is very realistic, including a thin skin of the atmosphere and the auroras.
Irregularities will certainly be found on closer inspection.
In addition, when reading comments, for example, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic debris in orbit appears reversed in some scenes than it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (Employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things were adapted by the creators to their needs, but I did not notice any fundamental and heavenly violations against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of a similar focus, it is evident that the creators took care of the credibility of the events depicted.
From moments that make no sense to name the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a different inclined orbit than the ISS.
The consequence is a very different mutual speed, and the rescue operation could not, in fact, take place as shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of the separation of Kowalsky (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces the two actors to embark on the moment they no longer move towards each other.
Bombardier's profit plunges as a result of a decline in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, which is due to fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier also released no air test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information on whether the aircraft will adhere to an ambitious plan to launch commercial operations from next September.
After the inaugural test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not meet their estimates and shares on the Toronto stock exchange fell by 8 percent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded the rating from "higher profitability" to "sector performance" on Thursday, with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While smaller aircraft shipments were mostly expected, a profitable shipping spread has disappointed us significantly," Doerksen said in a message to clients.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new CSeries aircraft orders.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we anticipate that the market skepticism will increase against this programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft will make it to the bottom of the market, which now dominates Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and the first flight took place in September after a delay of several months.
However, the number of binding orders of CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the test flight results to verify the company's claims regarding low consumption and savings on the cost of the airline.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to achieve 300 binding orders for the first commercial aircraft.
Executives also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that the test on the ground and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates and we did that.
This will happen throughout the flight schedule.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test planes is expected to take off in the coming weeks and the others not long after.
Analysts are nevertheless skeptical that the first customer could start operating a CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims to have evaluated its plan for commissioning the aircraft and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of air tests – although it is in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – will probably reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ending on September 30.
Adjusted yields per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover dropped marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters, analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had supplied only 45 aircraft compared to 57 aircraft earlier in the quarter.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled orders in the aviation division accounted for 32.9 billion as of September 30, which does not change even as of December 31.
"The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but low order reception and the overall market status disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said the yield in the division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts accounted for 32.6 billion as of September 30, a marginal growth compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by the problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Executives said new outlooks would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichette's arrival, fell 8.5 percent during trading on Thursday afternoon to $4.83.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, announced a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Mick Jagger says he definitely didn't go after 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview with the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that she sang backing vocals for Jagger's song "Old diet die hard."
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran, and he went after her.
She added, “That was a long time ago, and now he’s very nice to me.”
In a statement from Thursday, Jagger's (70) representative said he categorically denied ever making Katy Perry proposals.
The representative said, "Maybe he's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the visiting singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted in first place this week.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"This is a frightening report and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent parliament from simply swept away from the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper said, considering the bill unconstitutional.
"This bill is strict and very repressive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is the extended hand of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to MPs," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill is effectively handing over "complete control over the media" to the government, and Standard reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have "worn a hard blow" and criticize the bill as "stricd."
Approval of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the Islamic gunman attack in September at the Westgate shopping mall.
The authorities' anger was turned to the Kenyan media when they broadcast a security camera footage on which soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looted a luxury goods store.
The police chief responded by summoning two journalists and the media executive for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after media pressure.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million by Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million along with the risk of "official from the list" or they may be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The General Court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to eliminate most radio stations.”
It is also reported that these measures may have a liquidation impact on what is called the Kenyan “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“You never know what might happen,” Nation journalist Mutuma Mathium wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balancing in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of criticism from the public in the past.
In May, they voted to lift cuts ordered by the National Pay Agency and to renew their fat salaries around 532 000 untaxed shillings per month, which thus rank among the highest in the world.
As a result of the tax on the owners of foreign real estate, the London bubble is bursting
The Treasury Department has provisionally quantified the tax on the proceeds of financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborne, who presented a 7% fee in the 2012 budget for the transfer of real estate for buildings worth over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
The proceeds from the real estate transfer fee in the housing stock in the districts of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "Due to the increase in the transfer of real estate at homes of high value and the introduction of the related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value assets are under-taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system."
He added that “this move may have caused some foreign investors to be adversion to buy real estate in London, or that existing owners are beating themselves to sell.”
Front properties – up to 10% of the housing market by price – in the rich belt that ranges from Fulham to Wimbledon, saw an increase of a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices continue to show steady growth of 5.6% in the middle of London year by year, but were overshadowed by the thriving "domestic market" at which, according to a survey by the real estate agency Savills, experienced southwest, north (7.4%) and the East (6.5%) increase.
