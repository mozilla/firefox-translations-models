Civil rights movement issues travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Favorability of Colored People (NAACP) has published a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory state principles and racist attacks.
"NAACP's travel recommendation for the state of Missouri, with effect from August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay extra attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state," the association's statement read.
The NAACP said it took the step under Missouri's current laws, which make it difficult to defend racist-motivated acts before a court, as well as as the conduct of law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
“There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police officers just because of the color of their skin, they are being attacked or killed," NaaCP president for Missouri Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
“We have the largest number of complaints to date.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated swearing directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in disputed circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and police put him in custody without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also highlights a recent statement by Missouri's top prosecutor's office, which states that black drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People must be prepared – they should carry money with them to pay bail or notify their relatives that they are going to travel by state.”
According to current FBI numbers, hundreds of hate crimes were reported in Missouri in 2015, putting the state in 16th place among all states.
At the same time, the travel alert is a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue society for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people under a violation of the law, which is supposed to improve racial profiling, according to the ACLU.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for Foreign Countries, but recently, advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the U.S.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family doesn't have peace after 12 years!
The murdered is model Sally Anne Bowman.
The girl, originally from Croydon, was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixi directly in the restaurant she worked in, who planted stab wounds on her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, and then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe, watching the careful crime work of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He admitted only assaulting juveniles in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl dead lying in the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were arguing about the fateful night.
The killer said: "He was really angry and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of a taxi driver," he said falsely.
The girl, according to his testimony, should have defended herself, but she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven a lie and she accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he spoke of his horniness and her taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexia himself said to police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family is facing further attacks from vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people at large who are digging up these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the mother of the late girl, Linda, revealed to the Mirror about the disappearance of the ash urn.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither prudish nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique Intimacy.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started inconspicuously, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip in Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bike, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
"The various molls and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with a German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which interested Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs the Intimaty boutique in Prague’s Benedict Street, where he sells erotic aids in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why wouldn't he?
These are also design items.
Wait, moment, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you think?
Oh, come on, don't be such puritans!
The Berlin-based Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
It opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than what everyone here is used to.
No covered shop windows, all made in a beautiful, subtle style, products exhibited more like in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to accommodate the Prague shop, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
"It has to do with intimacy, and it's also, you might say, tender," he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the variant won, which spread the shop into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom, which is dominated by the bed.
It was prepared for us by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found space in 2013.
At first it didn't seem ideal to us, because it's not on the main street, but it made him sit on the name of Intimacy.
He's intimate.
It is in the alley next to the main one, so no one will look at the customers," Martin Ráz praises himself.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a store that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed of the fact that they even entered such a trade.
When I entered the boutique of Intimacy half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like going to the erotic aids store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from boutiques with fashion.
Even if there is only female service in the shop, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, it does not mean that the male foot does not come here.
Mostly, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't estimate the right size and choose a bigger one," Martin smiles over a frequent mistake.
These are the prejudices, the ingrained clichés, that women need some great aids, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men choose mostly black underwear, while a woman usually tends to pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the expression on my face that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoris stimulator.
I struggle with the adolescent need to cling with admiration for the serious tone of my interpretation.
It's like it doesn't grumble.
And it doesn't really gloom.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well accepted.
This is the latest revolutionary novelty.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for the We-Vibe couples.
He completely broke down the taboo, which in some men may persist, namely that in erotic aids he sees competition.
"There are different variations being made," he continues.
With one engine, with two motors, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
With a love connection, a woman can have a control in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attaching vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women, it seems, prefer multipurpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they use it only externally.
In Western Europe, especially for younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would probably have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin said.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold is mainly masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experience while using it.
It is very different in Japan.
It brings out wonder in me.
I thought Japanese women would enjoy erotic aids a lot, I object.
"That's the internet reality," it explains to me.
The everyday one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with women using them.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just for the record, what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not very prudish.
On the contrary, we are quite a welcoming nation.
Unlike countries like Catholic Poland and Italy.
A typical client of the business ranges between 35 and 50 years old and "he already has some experience both with sex life and with some aids.
She comes for something nice, better quality to complement her partner’s life, or to herself.” Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of it by convincing each product whether it is perfectly functional.
We also do not want to engage in specialties such as bondage and latex, because we do not have the space for it, on the other hand, it is not suitable here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are people who have always been shy about going to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like this would come out at them.
A lot of products on the shelves are really appealing.
It is also due to the selection of renowned brands represented.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The very first awardee was the aforementioned sea horse "and it triggered a change in the whole industry.
It began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, work with health-conscious, other designs, different colors began to be produced...
What is pleasant is that the Czech woman, the popular designer Anna Marešová, is behind the design of some.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised how many people buy those design things from Anna Marešová from us, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for Venus balls by Anna Marešová.
She did a really huge job by presenting exactly what we are trying to present within the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a school job.
It is now a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know from what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a big-production, but a small series, it's certainly more costly than a big series.
I may be going upstream a little, but I find it important to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It could easily happen that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything," Anna describes the situation later, who agrees with Martin that our society is becoming more and more open.
He does not encounter a negative or dismissive attitude.
People are embarrassed at most.
"But even then they start to smile." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator in her offer, for which you can have a personal message, and this year she is also planning her own lubricant.
In the year after, vibrating eggs and other news should be added.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the limit of what's right lies.
Is there anything Martin Ráž wouldn't already be selling?
It's terribly hard to define.
What seems normal to one, to another may seem completely abnormal, so we are more likely to define ourselves with an assortment of branded manufacturers.
None of them are engaged in extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they got?
Just now, an e-mail arrived earlier in which a lady demanded masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a natural twenty-eight centimeters long.
So we had to write that unfortunately we don't have anything like that.
The question is whether someone made fun of us," Martin said with a suspicious look.
This also happens from time to time...
A blow for Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is struggling with a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend is battling a disease that will steal people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately, it's true," the singer himself confirmed the sad information to Lightning.
I know about my illness and so far I can handle it due to the circumstances.
"I'm taking medications that have the accompanying phenomena of the disease to slow down," he added, saying he thanked loved ones for their support.
The whole extended family came together to make life easier for Karl.
Wife Eva is trying to be at home as much as possible, her daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Tereza come to the house on Bílá Hora, the son of Karel Karel said Karlas.
He fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Slavík to support him during his demanding treatment.
He's had sixty chemotherapy treatments.
After that, he was able to return to work on the tennis court and on the ski slopes.
"I have predicted from an astrologer that I will be here until the ninety," said Karel Blesku.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
The actress Květa Fialová is now struggling with the same disease in the institution.
Do you have an Alzheimer’s patient in your family?

Chilean parliament lifts abortion ban, law will assess ÚS
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on abortion, so it must not be carried out for medical reasons.
"I'm sorry that the legislators filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we've been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende complained.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and should be given a new chairman, who is close to the opposition, according to AFP, at the end of August.
The bill abolishing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, passed the Senate 19. July.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would be contested in court because it violated the right of the unborn child to live.
MPs postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was analyzed by a mixed parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, MPs approved the proposal, and after that, the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislation, there should be a criminal abortion in three cases: if a woman's life is at risk, if the fetus has no chance of survival, or if the pregnancy has arisen from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed since 1931, before women were given the right to vote in 1949.
An absolute ban on abortion in 1989 was imposed by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
Others include Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to 30 years in prison for interrupting their pregnancies.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called a murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is criticism of statues.
The Americans could tell the story as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key proponents of the Trump regime, certainly knew what was coming when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the subject of the president's proposals to drastically curtail legal immigrants, he set off with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
It is fitting to add that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emma Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller rebuked Acosta, “I don’t want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the world.
A poem that has been placed on the pedestal additionally, and to which you refer, is not part of it.”
Miller is actually right, but as he said, this is not about history.
These are, above all, the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - he invites not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let me go, whoever falls, who is poor, who can barely breathe freely, who with a miserable worm in the middle of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “wretched worms” on our screens.
Miller didn't try to criticize poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people were not welcome in the U.S.
This conflict about the importance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the statue's pedestal, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was supposed to express the union of the French and American republican government by representing the classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has his own voice.
It also has a very different name: the mother of the exiles.
The combination of the poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the followers of the right have long sought to reverse this meaning.
Well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jan the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not actually invite anyone into the country, but represented early neoconstructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
It brings out the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to illuminate the journey to the United States.”
Oddly enough, Limbaugh is referring to an important thing.
The importance of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the perspective of an exhausted and damned passenger who often arrives in a new country with hope after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power.
The 2017 World Athletics Championships: Neil Black sings praises to Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
UK athletics Federation director Neil Black said a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup team will be a "huge asset to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 World Championships in London, which begins on Friday.
Black believes that something special is happening in Scotland and British athletics could learn easily from Scots.
“We’re trying to understand and adapt – we’re going to work on it,” Black said.
"I've spoken to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it's got something to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it’s absolutely amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will be aiming for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000-m race while Eilidh Doyle was elected as the team's captain.
“Eilidh is humble.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scottish or other national athletes, came out of the room with a sense of great pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings that Eilidh spoke to were unrepeatable.'
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in running over obstacles at 400 m at her fifth World Championships, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The middle-class runner Muir has set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
He will participate in the 1500 m and 5000 m run at the World Championships.
Another great Scot is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track at 1500 m. He has won British team races and Annual Games this season.
Doyle recalls her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish team member, Lee McConnell.
The team captain led to the fact that she is “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues got into the team, but in many cases they will also attack participation in the finals and medals.
“The extraordinary thing about the team captain is that I was elected by the other team members. It was a great honour for me, but the knowledge that I was elected by the team members is all about that, it is about that.”
“I’m obviously very proud of all the Scots who have made it to the team.
It proves where I've moved.
They're athletes who will be thinking of the top spots on the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did well.
I was just pointing out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it is held on home soil.
It's important to take advantage of the support of the home fans and rejoice at the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race and I will enjoy the incredible atmosphere.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't back down on public office if you can't bear the criticism of voters
Our country's father knew of his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away from us – and stupid and mute we will be led like sheep to slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on starting to behave like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
He was sued this week by the American Union for Civil Liberties.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as groundless, and many opinions such as "who cares" appeared in the comments on the Internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when people like Hogan are involved.
In an absolutely Democratic state, this is a hugely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second-highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not an irritable.
As you can see, he governs his state with the certainty of his own and strictly adheres to the principles.
It turned out to be skillful in using Facebook as the main means of connecting with its constituents - the exception is not even the publication of the first photo with a bare head after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's site - which is a public forum, identified as official and managed by his employees paid with taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor, saying the blocking of comments took place from the position of moderating the posts.
However, using an image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people who were deleted from posts.
And that's exactly what they are - real people speaking to their elected leaders; a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
As everyone put it, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I have politely remarked that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in a section with comments from the Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are labeled by some people as promoting so-called collective effort, instead of being recognized as a larger group of stakeholders.”
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam interest" would probably be called "advocacy."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require the deployment of employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all the copies with criticism or arrest or silence the Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The Loudoun County Board of Supervisors chairwoman violated, according to District Judge James C. Cacherise's First Amendment in Alexandria, where it prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also made a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's time, the low price of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote letters to newspapers, questioning Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people as part of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were piling up in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, disapproval and intimidation lie within the very foundations of our nation.
And a true leader has to accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, they use more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On the one hand, they have more time to browse the web, and under the umbrella usually do not have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
This is according to fresh statistics from O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available within the flat rate than at home.
It is therefore not surprising that in Croatia, where the minimum of Czechs travel through the winter, data consumption increased even fifty-fold this summer season.
Italy came second in the ranking of the data consumed.
Most minutes the Czechs call from Germany, where many of them go on business even during the summer.
According to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia visits 800 thousand Czechs every year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year’s 7 was record high. July.
"Tens of millions of photos could fit into the transferred data," said Silvia Cieslar, director of the O2 mobile segment.
Although Croatia runs in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have so much time to browse the Internet.
"In addition, the Czechs are heading to the Adriatic through Austria," Cieslarová explained.
While the operator has seen high year-on-year growth in data after the release of roaming charges, for telephony the growth is much lower.
The number of minutes of roaming has doubled compared to last year.
With a huge lead over other countries, Germany dominates here.
"Calls in roaming are used more by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golf leader Ronan Rafferty will hope for a relaxed atmosphere at Renaissance Club in Scotland's East Lothian administrative district over the next three days, hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who is from Northern Ireland, succumbed to Paul Eales last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the final. This year, he will play the role of tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up in front of my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world of its beauty," Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a keen defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
Englishman Eales will defend his championship title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," the Southport golfer said.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to golf.
I remember last year when Sharon and I and my wife meant a lot of win.
It was a beautiful time I won’t forget.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region this year, returns to home soil.
The event will be his first participation since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said of Helensburgh.
“You want to thrive and feel a lot of pressure.
I really liked playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I’m happy with the result so far.”
The three players will also be joined on the pitch by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. The parking fee is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian land of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pan.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the speech of the local "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, remove the potato and enjoy it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on a muddy country - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing clothes in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof replaces the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no field was assigned to her to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working until late at night is a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. There are also soldiers in the village.
“In the afternoon after five o’clock, no one dares to wander around the village,” says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when just 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public upheaval of hands in front of the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against Dutch rules has quickly turned its anger against the Yakart government, which controlled the entire region except foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a distant and ravaged city, which you can reach after a ninety-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach clutching the ride.
Public transport does not work in this place.
The town with 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners, looked at this place.
Before the Christians arrived, locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing this dress," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
It is also an Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoeenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province approximately the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports logging at an estimated $78 billion.
However, these wealths are a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
The investigation, conducted in 2005 by the New York Times, shows that Freeport paid local military officials and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including a sum of 150,000 dollars for a single officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore harshly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tormented and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
Mass murders in the Papua tribal region during the 1970s were tantamount to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Brazilian archdiocese, describes the atrocities that occurred last year, like extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report, especially popular rape and execution by electric current - and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
"It's difficult to count the death toll because the incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian research fellow at Human Rights Watch.
The situation was aggravated by the fact that the Papuan sources attracted colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% are Christian, but demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from Indonesia's islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to survive.
"Immigrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains twenty-four-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the capital of the province of Jayapura.
“The original inhabitants of Papua – mama-mama (women) – have lost their jobs.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is nicknamed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations as part of his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured and his trip to the presidential palace in a jakarta of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope of hearing our call for justice," You said.
The reality is that just two months after Jakowi's October inauguration, Paniai experienced a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs by the campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the gloom of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this rebuke and tone, which she was told to touch and later returned with four other soldiers, local parish priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state chased a group of children and beat them with the butts of their weapons, the victims and witnesses said.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so heavily that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby electoral commission building, and the following day things were still escalating.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football pitch outside the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came up with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - in which they run in a circle and imitate the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing rocks at buildings.
With the escalating tension, the soldiers were ordered over the radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you have permission to shoot," according to the TIME weekly, said in an official document, the contents of which were never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Enarotali district, Kego Koto, recognized the impending danger and urged residents to disperse into their homes.
But no one had his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colourfully painted wooden house.
Kayame doesn't know who the shooter was yet, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
“There were a lot of people all around and there was a lot of shooting,” he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
The Papuan Police Inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely "providing" the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," a spokesman for the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped with injuries.
The news of the murders passed through the Yakart media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims' families and vowed to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again," he said.
National Security Secretary Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve violent acts that have occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, there were excuses.
“Most of the acts of violence have been committed a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
In an interview of 5. However, in June for the TIME weekly, which took place in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, "all cases will be brought before the court."
Wiranto, whom the U.N. has accused of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the independent 1999 election in East Timor - said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, have been settled so far.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting welcomed his claims with disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but I haven't seen anything in the past three years," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m afraid,” as he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me," he said.
The shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The scuffle, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred between the villagers and the construction company's manager, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's building.
According to the statement, the villagers threw rocks at the members and the answer was a warning gun.
Locals, however, say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitaristic police) began shooting into the crowd, killing one person.
"There was a panic, we were afraid of retribution," 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured, told TIME.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papuai Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Paniai. It is not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the pretext of "providing national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the Papuai population as a "tragic and forgotten place."
Poverty adds oil to the fire.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is equally unreachable.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost just 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants have begun to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already so few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to embark on business.
"Young people are moving out of villages because of a lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
There are also strict rules for foreign journalists.
Earlier this year, two French journalists were expelled from the papui - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - because of "a lack of cooperation with the authorities," all despite the fact that they were given such a rare permit to film.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised to repeal strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. But that never happened.
"Foreign journalists who work in the rebellious easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: not to recognise visas and blacklisted," he said in a statement.
The lack of news from the pens of foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesian in the Papua case is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations urged - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on investigations into "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including shootings in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for Indonesia's foreign ministry, shook off the accusations when he told reporters in Jakarta that: "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, local people proclaimed, according to a source who also attended the session but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want freedom."
There are more elections scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the Paniai shooting," Gobau, chairman of the tribal council, said.
He wants Jokowi to know that the residents of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a robbery army - are rolling in poverty, miserable education and the health system.
Gobai argues that the people of Paniai, like the other Papuans, regard their voice as the “debt” that the Jokows must repay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite threats and intimidation by the family of the victims of the Pan-Aia shooting, they continue their latest symbolic act of defiance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done for enough, at least it will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said, his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French navy has captured a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French navy has detained a yacht carrying 1.46 tonnes of cocaine worth about $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
A four-member crew of the ship, which is apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested during the intervention.
The yacht, named Afalina, set sail from South America and was dragged to the port of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean, after its detention.
The Australian intelligence service said it would, in cooperation with its international partners, seek to determine exactly where and where the drugs were headed and to reveal a "Lithuanian syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs going to Australia," said its chief executive, Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street prices of drugs.
The country is also grappling with the problem of a growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first recently.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking must be reminded.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, according to the doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague Pavla Mádlová, the solution could be an infusion of saline solution, which is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
So far, these are only applied in healthcare facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"And in addition, it loses the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally receive less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," Mádlová said.
They should drink two liters for sure.
"But getting so much fluid into an old person is a big deal," she added.
In homes for the elderly, she often does not guard it.
In hospitals, dehydration is commonly dealt with by infusions.
"I think that even there should gradually be introduced so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two pint bottles of saline can be delivered to old people in a day.
A lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration is manifested as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day, the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
Blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, maximum cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more nursing-intensive, but it would be ideal to uncover the patient occasionally and let the skin air out," the doctor said.
The Torch was on fire for the second time in Dubai
In Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers went up in flames on Friday. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high and 79-storey building.
In the last two years, this is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We were asleep and we were woken up by an alarm. We heard screaming.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," Geroge, one of the skyscraper's residents, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence said firefighters managed to bring the fire under control around 4am (0:00 GMT), after which they continued to cool the building.
Government officials have added that they are providing alternative accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could again spark a discussion about the safety of materials used to licing high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which were launched by the management of the Torch skyscraper after the 2015 fire, showed that the most damaged linings and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said the Grenfell Tower's isolation and lining system may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in a June fire in which nearly 80 people were killed.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. carry banned items on board the plane
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them knowingly or unconsciously uttered prohibited objects through a checkpoint of the U.S. government's Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. A minimum of six percent of passengers have stepped on board the plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they have belatedly found to have travelled with a firearm, ammunition or explosive.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and to which more than 1,000 inquirers responded - showed that younger passengers were more likely to be broken by rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to trying to knowingly travel with an object that is banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand flying hours compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that have escaped TSA attention include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents consciously uttered a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted to deliberately uttering banned drugs on board the plane.
The company said it was conducting research among passengers around the world to determine how many of them had accidentally uttered unauthorized items through an airport checkpoint and how much it had done so on purpose.
Unsurprisingly, most people who have transferred unauthorized objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company has pointed out, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what liquids and in what quantities they can carry to the plane.
It is no surprise that TSA has seized the currently banned liquid in the largest amount.
For some time, people thought that TSA would handle books in the same way as smuggled goods.
The transport of fluids is allowed within domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on delaying planned directives to reduce Obama administration's emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, its chief, Scott Pruitt, dismissed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes under his plan. It responds more quickly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge filed against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
This applies to the last date set at 1. October, when states should start complying with the 2015 regulations to reduce ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "intervention with local decisions or impending economic growth."
Pruitt, who held the position of Oklahoma's state attorney general before being appointed head of the EPA, for a long time, served as a reliable opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden turnaround Wednesday is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA's executor had exceeded his authority in an effort to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration's plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed its version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with states through complex processes and the fulfilment of new standards within a given timeframe.
"Under the government of the previous administration, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to a settlement and further setting up plans," said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA.
“We do not believe in regulation by lawsuit and we take the fulfilment of the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes from it.”
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt could use "the option of delay and all other legally available authorities" at some point to ensure that regulation "is based on sound policy and the most accessible information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive transcript of ozone rules.
The White House budget, approved last month, is seeking to delay the 2015 implementation of the rules by at least eight years.
The measure still has not passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group would not allow legal pressure.
“The turnaround in the EPA’s views – following our court battle – is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman added.
New York City was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone occurs when common harmful substances discharged by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists acknowledge Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It's worrying what pressure we need to exert to change the minds of those responsible and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to struggle with the Trump administration’s ideological campaign to help polluters and special interests.”
He poured acid on the man, yet he is not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you're laughing, in the other, your whole life suddenly changes from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopheros from the UK, whose face was etched by an acid unknown attacker, who was eventually acquitted.
The information was reported by Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on Christopheros' door.
Andreas said he was going to open.
He thought there was probably a courier outside the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
A man he had never seen in his life spilled acid on him immediately after opening without warning, saying, "That's for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing and I felt just an incredible pain on my skin," Andreas said.
The family quickly took him to the hospital, but there his loved ones learned terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Ninety percent were struck by a face that doctors were trying to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A major complication for Christopher was the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most tortured thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from an unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he captioned his torment.
Today, Christopheros has had twelve operations that are far from the last.
Accidents that suffer victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after a demanding and long-term treatment, victims of tissue have scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight deformation and disfigurement throughout their lives," Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons, said in a statement.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man must have mistaken him for someone.
The perpetrator believed that he was taking revenge on a man who had sexually abused his close person.
Police investigated the case properly and later tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the amazement of Christopheros's family fundamentally changed.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be overturned because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said in a statement.
Over the past few years, the number of corrosive infestations has increased considerably.
The Ministry of the Interior has commented on the issue by planning to establish new guidelines for prosecutors regarding the classification of corrosives.
They should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, victims of such attacks do not intend to surrender.
They demand that the UK government enforce harsher and longer prison sentences for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for tightened controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as they are different detergents.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai was on fire at night with the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the residents of the eighty-storey building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upstairs.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We were asleep.
We were woken up by an alarm, people were screaming.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," tenant George described the events.
Another witness for CNN estimated the flames had engulfed about 40 apartments.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, according to the civil defense, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its creation is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power went out.
The large-scale fire was also damaged by Dubai's The Torch skyscraper in February 2015, destroying more than a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, no one was harmed, because the residents managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and became the tallest residential building in the world with its 352 meters.
Another Dubai skyscraper deprived him of the record the following year.
The bodybuilder had a whopping 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a sample of twenty-three-year-old Ippolito was a varied collection of illicit means - from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is facing four years of distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record number of caught athletes.
The third-league player began taking steroids the year before when he fell for bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She hugged passionately with her ex-lover!
When Lucka Vondráčková has entered the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
It also attracts attention wherever it goes.
The last time her former lover Michal Dlouhý fell into her arms, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and longed for a family.
Lucie was only 19 years old and certainly did not want to hang her career on the nail.
So they went from each other, but remained friends to this day.
They also managed to do so at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, the two matched in blue.
At first they ignored each other, but then they became close, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes until she grabbed her stomach.
Then they hugged and posed willingly for the photographers.
However, their meeting was not a coincidence, because they will play together a lover couple in the new series Primy Captain Exner.
The Islamists were given life sentences in the UK for preparing for the assassination.
A British court on Thursday sentenced four members of an Islamist cell to life in prison, calling itself the Three Musketeers and, according to prosecutors, planned a terrorist attack against the police and the military.
The four men, two of whom took part in a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar deeds, were arrested last August.
Authorities believed at the time that he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with signs that mean "infidels" in Arabic, and a gun model.
This happened when a MI5 Secret Service agent placed a listening device in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown what horror the defendants could have caused if they had not been stopped," prosecutors' deputy prosecutor Sue Hemming said in a statement.
Three convicts, aged 28, 25 and 33, can apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after just 15 years behind bars.
The men claimed to be innocent during the trial in London and that a MI5 agent had placed the weapons found in the car there.
The court also heard it, but then dismissed the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
In the Hodonín region they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for just two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region, it surpassed Thursday, which thus far became the warmest day of the year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
There were no temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or leveled at 35 out of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, record temperatures recorded just nine long-term measuring stations.
In Strážnice, for example, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region, Thursday's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice in the Brno region the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
It was ten degrees less in the west.
High temperatures occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After Strážnice, the biggest heat was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, Thursday's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius, according to the CHMI website.
"Temperatures started to rise there later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heatwaves in the Czech Republic will gradually subside, according to the CHMI, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
However, in most places in Moravia, high temperatures will remain on Friday and southeast Moravia and Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of power resources.
It spends tens of billions of dollars a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry into foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not doing well.
The state media there talks about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals rose just 3.8 percent last year and roughly 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, evaluates the situation in the world's most populous country, University of Beijing's economics professor Christopher Balding, in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, and citizens of the others must obtain a visa in advance.
At Chinese authorities in the U.S., therefore, crowds are comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs 140 dollars, but if you don’t want to wait for it for hours in a queue, you have to pay 100 dollars or more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic obstacles.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the country's number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and less than one percent of all residents, was visited by 1.8 million Americans.
China often exacerbates the problem itself when it uses tourism to realize its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift around South Korea's missile defense system, the South Koreans repaid it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw it grow by 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the U.S. central bank, the Fed could leave China as a result of foreign trips of the Chinese to up to 190 billion dollars, while China will receive about 35 billion dollars a year as part of the sale of the currency to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of 217 billion dollars in tourism last year, equal to 44 percent of China’s entire surplus in trade in goods.
Thus, a small number of tourists, which anxiously prevents the outflow of capital, is dealting a very painful blow.
However, the above factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, less than a million foreigners lived across China.
There are more in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
You won’t find them in China.
Resolving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being offered is the simplification of the visa system.
Other Asian countries, notably India and Vietnam, have recently been making great efforts to simplify and make visa procedures cheaper.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen zoo, they multiplied deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Kingdom of Poison in Pilsen can enjoy the young of the three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newborn Turkish vipers.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 metres.
"It also grows to a meter in length," zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba described.
The young of the other two species, the deadly bearers and the cobras of red, will be gaining strength in the breeding facilities of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them.
"We would not like to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Australian vipers have come into the world eight, the descendants of a breeding pair native to the population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the mortals from around Perth," Vobruba said, adding that in human care, it is necessary for the deathbreaker to wintering 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
One hundred percent success was accompanied by a clutch of African spitting cobras of red.
The couple in the Pilsen zoo hatched from four eggs a total of four chicks.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to four meters away.
It's aimed at the eyes, it can cause a permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on mouse holats in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden, they still expect the hatching of the chicks from the clutch of the black mamba, the eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of a phone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico over paying for a border wall
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 telephone interview with Mexican President Enrique Peña Niet, Trump urged him to stop publicly proclaiming that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The US president blamed him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, reportedly saying, “You can’t speak like that in the press.”
As part of his campaign, Trump pledged to build a wall along the southern border and proclaimed that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. surveillance agreement over refugees bound for Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came out under President Obama - he would look like "drugged" after he proposed a ban on refugees entering the U.S.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that "this is my most uncomfortable call of the day."
Tusk testified again at the prosecution over Smolensk.
"He has something to fear," the dead president's brother, the leader of the ruling Law and Justice PiS party, Jaroslaw Kaczyński, said in Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk replied, reading to the country's current leadership that he was trying to abuse the justice system against political rivals.
On leaving the prosecutor's office, according to TVN 24, a crowd was waiting for Tusk, which was chanted by Donald Tusk! and wished the politician One Hundred Years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to worry about and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
He does not blame prosecutors, but he does not doubt that the judiciary should serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, the opposition or people they do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
He was in questioning for the second time.
The ex-premier was interviewed at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time the interrogation was supposed to relate to misconduct in the autopsies of victims of the Smolen disaster.
In addition, it was discovered to replace the bodies in coffins.
They banned families from opening coffins, and there must have been some reasons for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was meant to serve to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU," Kaczyński told Catholic television Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would thwart Tusk's chances of winning the most important seat in the union, from which, however, Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczyński said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk could end up with it in different ways, but she did not take note of it.
Tusk had already undergone eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's office on April 19.
Even then, he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his summonses for questioning were part of an obvious effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking it to various scandals.
The prosecutor's office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice in Poland, who plays the role of Attorney General.
The summons for questioning came soon after the election of Tusk as head of the European Council, which Kaczyński tried hard but in vain to prevent, among other things, during Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
In the end, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone at the EU summit against extending Tusk’s mandate.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the House of Representatives from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its embassies since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This follows from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update, currently in a comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10 thousand Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry explains its procedure.
"New embassies have been established in some countries, some offices have been closed or there has been a change in the level of representation," the material said.
The Decree contains two annexes, the first of which shall be the representative offices to which the paper ballots are delivered.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the press version.
It is their list that changes with the decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also abolished its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will also be no election at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the embassy list in Nairobi, Kenya, the Senegalese capital, Dakar, and Zambia's Lusaka.
In Asia, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation since the last parliamentary elections to include the Consulate General in Iraqi Irbil and Chengdu, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan.
Ballots will also be available to registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose MPs at polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the state electoral commission by lot will determine the region for whose candidates are voted abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when it was decided among South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is increasing steadily.
About 3800 people came to vote at the premiere 15 years ago, in 2006 there were around 6700, four years later 8222.
10,571 voters came to the embassies for the early parliamentary elections four years ago.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Recalled Racist Lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past the onlookers of Monroe, Georgia, and corked toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
However, before the car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with weapons blocked the way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - long-swiped from a cigarette and stared at the car's windshield.
Inside, the passengers were shaking with fear.
"We want that n--and Roger!" the man shouted.
"Bring it to me!"
The silence breaks the roar of a young black man who is pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is a mere reconstruction of events that occurred on 22. July.
But when one of the men throws a noose over the “Roger’s” neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, Moore's Ford has been returned regularly to a group of activists who reconstruct the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has ever been tried for murder.
“It’s surprising that not a single person has been arrested in all these years—even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identities,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reconstruction of the event.
“It is a stain on our history and the burden in our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights campaigner.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to the action. Every year, the Monroe community reminds us that justice has not been done for enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
“Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated.”
The medical examiner covers 27. July 1946 one of the bodies of the victims of the lynchings at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were expected to attend the lynching.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain free for decades, civil rights supporters argue that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, following a decision by the Supreme Court, the people of the black state of Georgia were granted the right to participate for the first time in the elections, which were scheduled for the summer.
And just during the summer election, black farmer Roger Malcom was supposed to stab the owner of Barnett Hester's white-skinned land during a skirmish during a scuffle - allegedly because of his wife.
In the city, Brooks said it was said that Hester had been in common with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to a different state.
According to the FBI, he took 25. July 1946 then the then significant owner of the land of white land Loy Harrison for Malcoma bail of $600.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
Returning from the prison, just before the entrance to Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turns out, Harrison planned the murders and organized them," the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and local law enforcement officers who not only participated in the lynchings, but also got rid of the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks commented more briefly on the matter.
“It was a massacre because of the right to vote,” he said.
“The murders had a clear subtext for all local black residents: ‘This is how you’ll end up if you sign up and go vote.’
The annual reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford Bridge has been organized for nearly a decade by Cassandra Greene.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and apt. It shows deep-seated racism that many would like to regard in modern America as extinct.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to avert sight, but Greene says it makes sense.
"Nobody wants to talk about lynching because in doing so, we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that are hiding in all of us," Ms. Greene said.
“But there can be no relationship between us unless you listen to what I had to go through.”
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of the blacks - flocked to the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director.
He played the leader of the Kukluxklan for many years, but in his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about it because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time.”
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, or Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a skirmish - Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for having sex with his wife.
"Get off my property n---e!"
Rascona can't.
There's a scuffle.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene says cheerfully.
"I just don't think the whites were saying 'n--r' that tone at the time."
"Exactly," one of the black actors says.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility will replace the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic. Just to be made for enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct utterance of the word on N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The roar, the shots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the actors' bodies and sings Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit."
With every word, there is sadness in the room.
Against the backdrop of it all, about a dozen onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came all the way from Ithaca, New York, many of the onlookers are from nearby.
Each of them endures the local damp climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them in the crowd to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until this moment, the murders could have been viewed with distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is scary.
With the song's final words, Greene prompts a crowd onlooking to inspect the bodies.
The children kneel down at the victim's heads, watch the false blood and the motionless bodies and whisper something in their ear.
"They're not dead," the little boy says.
A few minutes go by and Greene thanks the audience. It's over.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascon hugs his two friends-actors and cries in their arms; eventually, emotions reach him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know you hate the role.
But you had a reason for it.”
Later that day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is interested in talking about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could barely find words to express her feeling of today's performance.
“It’s difficult to listen to the ugly words and look at the horrible deeds that people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical issue,” she added, “he’s just called police skirmishes.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtroom. He enjoys dinner and talks about civil rights.
In his own words, he had already started planning the show for another year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience – but it’s also a moment to think about,” he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says that only cowards read the instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
I remember with nostalgia the past, where the instructions for use of anything were rather a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first turntable contained only one paper, on which were hieroglyphs depicting the wiring of some components, all of which were some secret marks.
When something went wrong inside me for years, I offered the document to a shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the back plate.
He told me with a grin, what the paper with the labyrinth of lines is suitable for.
Yes, it was a used tool in chronic toilet paper depletion.
He easily found the disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl pancakes again.
The new era has brought new instructions.
Even the relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply adhered to the cut grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
A sketch with a description of how to insert one piece into another was particularly good.
The kit was two-part and a different procedure was simply not possible.
Giving it the other way around required considerable effort with the need to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for the tutorials ended with my self-movement brand Seat Leon.
The year of manufacture 2003 still had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the blinker bulb.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and the work was to be completed.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected to state that while the bulb on the right could really only be replaced in three steps.
1. separate the cover.
2. unscrew the cracked bulb and screw in a new one.
3. slide the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of placing the battery cover.
Initially, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the bowels of the car, I would catch some spring, a screw, which the cover would be easily moved away and then I would follow the points of 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
The fault of the footbridge.
The cover had no space, no space, not even for the slim hand of Cinderella, let alone the obese Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life, without any success.
The condition was further enhanced by my wife's entrance to the garage, which was summoned by a cry and words that he hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked helplessly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I leave out the vulgar terms, there were only two publishable words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why does it take you so long?" she risked in a sentence that may be her last in a long-running volume.
I slowly explained the problem to her, and I placed the main emphasis on the procedure of the tortura of the author of the manual, where the burning iron on the hand, which the instructions wrote, then her tightening, so that he could never write anything again, was just an introduction to a wide range of instructions of the Witch Hammer, including his commissional burning on the top above the Losin castle.
"How about removing the box?" the woman said of the battery removal.
In sheer despair, this occurred and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just waking up from a collapsed state after checking two civil servants of the State Drug Control Unit.
I know him as a colleague of the balanced, who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who can tell even wild stories in an unexcited voice.
"Imagine I've been fined for not having a hand-washing manual," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I got out of it the whole problem, which was that above the sink in the toilet of patients does not have a picture instruction on how to wash your hands.
His argument to the commission official that adults usually know how to wash their hands and that there is no need for pictograms to handle the used activity of decent people did not have a healing effect and cost him considerable money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of soapy palms with running water is a primitive act at the level of the cromañon, that the modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
It should be said that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyful realization that a person washed his hands exactly as ordered by the Hosudar from SÚKL.
Finally, I have to say that I was inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the operation in the toilet.
In the question of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there the problem does not arise, in the case of urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to put up instructions two.
The problem remains those pictograms, because to create a perfect procedure means an accurate sketch of all the anatomical details, which could cause a certain outrage to the prude visitor of the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that throughout his life he has wiped the appropriate opening through a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson will lay off an additional 3000 employees and reduce the dividend in an effort to revive the deal
The British education group Pearson said Friday it would lay off an additional 3000 staff and cut an interim dividend of 72 per cent in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
The next wave of redundancies, which according to Chief Executive Officer John Fallon will take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, is followed by a previous decision by the company to lay off 4000 employees as part of a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program in an effort to resurrect a falling trade as a result of the sharp development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Pertelsmann's Penguin Random House, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after reporting a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were wounded, official officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the attack in the city's Qarabagh district.
This month, an Afghanistan bombing hit - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Heratian mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that Tuesday's blast occurred after a patrol along with members of the Afghan army was attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device."
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger and are located in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is an important source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
In late July, a bomb placed in a car killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people. It is the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S. troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to assist military troops and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks, to which schools in recent weeks have shaken the public's confidence in the government, its regulations and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
The EPA, in response to the lawsuit, reassessed its decision to delay smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency called off its decision to delay the Obama administration's law ordering states to cut emissions just a day after the agency was sued by 15 states.
The EPA announced its decision to refer the "Ozone Standards 2015" in the night of Wednesday, saying it was presenting the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will listen to their views," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced an effort by the EPA to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, determine the limits that must be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the majority of the Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA's actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - in Trump's words in an effort to kick-start economic growth.
But the new government's efforts have launched countermeasures from Democrats and conservative groups, which are worried about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing air with ozone content “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár received a blow and blood flowed!
This, quite new singer in our country, you may have already registered in June this year, when this previously almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event in our country, where he hosted such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not moderated by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show the public and to present their music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was held by the just-mentioned personalities.
However, few people already know that the actual shooting of the video clip, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it didn't go without a lot of embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramatics of the scene, the singer's rival was supposed to indicate a slap in the video clip.
At one point, however, he was hit so hard and straight in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, immediately the blood started from my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers settled the situation on the set that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the continuation of the next filming.
The aforementioned music video of the young artist is now being brought to you, you can also record the scene with a punch.
A failed version with blood, however, was not preferred to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at the meeting about the possibility of a duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most thrilling light-weight boxing match, met for the first time at Tuesday's meeting.
Each was in a separate room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion - came down to the lobby, where he welcomed Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
After Garcio's victory, based on a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's showtime match, the two boxers made the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia pulled his right-handed man and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck.”
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriagao at ESPN on Saturday at 19: 00.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be a "perfect test."
"I'm a former featherweight champion," Garcia adds.
“I had to gain weight because of the match with Broner (67 kg), but I’m not that big.
I'm small for my 63 kg.
I would like to return to the light weight category.
Lomachenko has to gain weight again to get light... then we can fight.
The fans want that.
Why not do it to them.”
Lomachenko agrees.
"Boxing would be good for this match."
Klimas made a request for payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko is expected to make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next year, who also expressed interest in the match against duel winner Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the Lightweight title in the Forum Arena on September 23.
"The match should take place in a payment-style for viewing, that's what the fans demand," Garcia said, who later said he was open to the possibility of broadcasting the match through a television station that would come with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will attract such attention.
We will wait for the right opportunity...”
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as an "amazing boxer" and could take part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko couldn’t be lulled by Garcia’s praise when he said that the champion of the three divisions from Riverside looked “very slow... sorry Mike, but you’re asking for a knockout.”
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and only then boxing.
Both boxers said they felt rising tensions before the duel with each other.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other match attracts so much attention.
And I'll put it in the fire with great comfort," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It will be a great match.”
The young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was now found at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova, have been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search for them began, but to no avail.
And the police eventually ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the whole story came.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Cheboksary in Chuvachsk.
It was thanks to the documents left in the car that the officers managed to identify the couple.
The documents survived for a decade underwater, without which it would have taken police much longer to find out the identities of those found.
The couple was last spotted when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous for the time being.
He reported his find to the Cheboksar police, who pulled the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by a frozen road leading along the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing, further details will be released after its completion.
Latest test results to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests by asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people were surveyed as over the age of 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃttsmedicinalverket) began conducting new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is to assess candidates more precisely in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has handed over 6880 cases for investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests, carried out from mid-March to 31. July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were assessed as over the age of 18, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency concluded that the interviewee was "possible over 18 years of age."
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was "perhaps under 18 years of age."
Tests shall be taken only if the age of the questioned person is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“Compared to last month, the statistics are in the tracks and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases, it was found that "the interviewed person is 18 years or older."
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases, the respondent said he would be 18 this year.
The method of determining age, which includes an X-ray of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of the knee joints, was also criticized, which is subsequently assessed by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person went through puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can’t determine age with precision, we shouldn’t pretend otherwise,” he told Metro.
Forensic medical agency Agency's GÃ¶ransson defended the decision in the words: "In general, it can be said that the risk of having an error of assessment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person interviewed is just below the 18-year limit, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all those questioned."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Niet, threatened not to meet with him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding will somehow be arranged, though he admitted it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump has spoken openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to a transcript of the interviews published Thursday by The Washington Post.
Trump has made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president, shortly after taking office, Trump undiplomatically rebuked Peñu Nieta for building critically of his plan to build a wall.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political issue and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press this," Trump said repeatedly in a January 27 interview, threatening to break contact with Mexico's president if he continues to issue defiant statements.
The funding will be made somehow, and in the end it will work out well.
"But if you say that Mexico will not pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," Trump said.
He called the wall the least significant thing we're talking about, but politically it may be the most important thing.
An executive order to build a wall, Trump issued shortly after taking power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of the 3200-kilometer wall, and the relations of the two countries have escalated.
In late March, Trump said the project would be used by the United States for now.
Trump eventually met with his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's January 28 phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull.
The White House chief of staff called the conversation ridiculous.
Such a conclusion was prompted by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting people from internment facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump initially considered the deal stupid, but later agreed to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you created, but you will have to stick to it," he told Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised as a good idea the Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation escalated.
"I hate accepting these people," Trump remarked.
I assure you, they are bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They're not going to be great people who go to work for local milkmen," he said.
In the interview, he also noted that the refugee could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump held telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, roughly a week after coming to the White House, often several in one day.
The call with Turnbull was finally described as the least pleasant for the whole day.
Before he finished it, he emphasized that he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
They executed the killer of Rana in front of the crowd.
Her father was watching, too.
The execution took place in the square in the capital, Yemen Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her father to the house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has affected an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of a thousand-headed crowd, which came together to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under the right of Sharia.
The victim's father, after the execution, communicated his feelings to the media.
I feel like I'm being reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Other members of the family were also present, along with the crowd shouting the slogan "long live justice."
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was dragged.
Police put him on his stomach.
One of the members turned his gun on him and opened fire from point-blank range.
The crowd present celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr. al Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Alah and Sharia law have prevailed," he added.
I stood in the Liberation Square in Sana, waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
Both I and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been done.
Police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hateful madness, grabbing the killer and lynching him.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Houthis.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his act provoked such outrage that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance 27. June.
Rana's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his house, they discovered evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would have been more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies and those injuries that carried Rana's body were terrible," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspaper and all our TV stations, the posters with her photo hung everywhere," he continued.
They all believe the police got a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of the horrific act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out playing with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where she was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the neighborhood, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held, and to demand immediate punishment.
A Justice Department representative read to the crowd's footage of the investigation to calm them.
The accused apparently did not show regret for his act.
Just before serving his sentence, officers read him the sentence, but the convict glanced only at his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but many of the recordings made by the crowd appeared on the Internet.
The governor of West Virginia has announced a change to the political party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally of President Trump that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the Justice governor said.
“Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I am notifying you... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I tell you that I can no longer support you from the position of Democratic Governor.”
A crowd of onlookers exploded into joy.
"I'm going to sign up to the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into a different match."
Trump has previously promised people an important announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the entire country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice has inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, issued a statement Thursday night saying: "The defection of the Governor of Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which puts obstacles in our way rather than doing it about uplifting our country."
"For a Democratic Party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of the Justice Governor is the final straw for an already vile party without a leader who seeks in vain to find positive and unifying reports," RNC President Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'singer' apology for doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time has not yet come for Russia's return to the sporting world.
The head of Russian athletics, Dmitry Shylakhtin, said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that his country's expulsion from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into effect in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think we have witnessed a very honest response and presentation today," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and is working with all its strength to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation.”
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have progressed to the next level, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to maintain the punishment that was cast on Russia," Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can to stabilize the situation in the next few months.
Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest ones," he concluded.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which begins on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the strict rules of the IAAF will compete under a neutral flag.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia still has several criteria to meet before it is admitted back.
Tests for the presence of drugs are still unsatisfactory and excluded coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF council's presentation ended.
The CzechTrade contract was awarded to František Savov, whose state is being prosecuted.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the Mladá fronta František Savov publishing house.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent of the points in all quality criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state is prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and is asking for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade announced a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract totaling 30.8 million crowns was awarded to the Mladá fronta publishing house of entrepreneur František Savov.
Czech police have already charged him with tax evasion in 2014 and are prosecuting him on the run.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is requesting his extradition.
The case was reported by news server Aktuálně.cz.
According to the original criteria of CzechTrade, the award of the contract was to be decided by 60 percent of the offered price and the remaining 40 beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
It was Savov’s company who was greatly helped by the second criterion.
According to Dotyk.cz, it received one hundred points in all partial quality criteria.
This was the result of which moved her before another candidate, the Vltava Labe Media VLM publishing house, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated with an amount of 404 900 crowns per month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike Mladá fronta, however, it received a total of 62 points from assessors in all quality criteria.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the server Aktuálně.cz, belongs to the publishing house Economia.
The VLM publishing house has filed several objections against the outcome of the tender, considering its evaluation to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it decided to contest the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Office for the Protection of Competition.
He believes that CzechTrade has acted in violation of the law.
"The petitioner is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a public contract supplier on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly favored by a participant in Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the petitioner and other suppliers," reads the application for the initiation of proceedings filed at the Office this week, which was published by the server Current.
According to the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be unreliable and a hundred percent evaluation of the Mladá fronta project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous achievement of one of the competitors to be unlikely and suspicious," Klíma told the Czech Republic.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts prior to their conclusion.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in accordance with the law in the Provincial Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulleting.
"After the completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but we cannot comment on its progress during the duration of the contract," Štěpán Dlouhý, the agency's media representative, told Dotyk.cz.
Mladá fronta responded by saying that it considers it extremely problematic that the Economia publishing house intervened in the competition in Aktuálně.cz, where it has its own business interests.
However, this was stated in the above article.
The tender may have helped her that she provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal in the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013 when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov is accused by the police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused alleged damage to the Czech state of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, whose influence includes the publishing house Mafra, is behind his criminalization.
A London court rejected Savov's appeal against the extradition last year, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the UK in the matter of the coming into force of the judgment to this day," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokeswoman for the Prague Public Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to the ownership of Mladá fronta, Savov was a member of the company Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund, purchasing at risk of assets.
He should also control the failed company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the removal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist drove along the sidewalks and through the park, he ended up in the cormelts.
The motorcyclist attracted attention by ruthless driving on the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol began to chase him, he decided to drive her away in the direction of the Station.
"Officers chased the man with caution through the city when he did not manage to drive on one of the side roads in Mariánské Lázně and drove his motorcycle into the field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
The accident eventually had to be approached by a rescue helicopter, which transported the injured motorcyclist to the Pilsen hospital.
Subsequently, officers found that the motorcyclist did not own a driver's license, the license plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his serial number was polished and the production label itself removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is under further investigation.
"The presence of alcohol in the driver was excluded at the scene by a breath test, but a positive result for the substance methamphetamine was detected by the test," the police spokesman added.
How will football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules limiting the funding of European football clubs will not in any way disrupt Neymar's record-breaking transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The financial fair play rules (FFP) that UEFA introduced in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
This is followed by several financial conditions for Neymar's transfer to France.
With the PSG team funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums on the purchase of players, but on the other hand, they have to prove legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overheads of football-related business activities.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after placing in the chair of the director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that are in debt in pursuit of new reinforcements ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP rules redirected their attention from club debts to monitor their losses.
That change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovic with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spent a lot of money on players y to build a global brand - was suddenly not so profitable.
As part of the current three-year trial period, which will end in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to 30 million euros.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cheferin, is determined to advocate a ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules still apply and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a one-time payment, it may, for accounting purposes, spread the amount for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to 44.4 million euros each year for five years.
The first wave of FFP's highest sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG have been fined 60 million euros (82 million dollars) - which were later reduced to 20 million euros - and a Champions League team reduction order to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is looking out for teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenue through companies linked to club owners.
Thus, although the Qatari company sponsors PSG once the funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the billing of the amount.
UEFA took a similar measure in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to PSG was too high.
Some of Neymar's income at PSG could be paid from the 2022 FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and the 2022 World Cup officials in Qatar have denied the fat that Neymat should become an ambassador for the World Cup in football and that such a manoeuvre would easily be detected by UEFA officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's statement by insiders, UEFA has not launched any investigation into the transfer of Neymar to PSG.
A source wished to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of 10 million euros and a turnover of 542.4 million euro.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expect the arrival of Neymar will be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
The Spanish league officials, obviously concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' of both the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Teba told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's same stance on club funding.
“This is the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the past 15 years,” Wenger said in a statement.
“Once the owner of the club becomes the state, anything is possible.
Complying with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state can have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomas Rosicky goes to the set.
The same scene as in Sunday's game against Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder moved the game against Crvené Zvezda, devising a few goalscoring, but his team-mates did not head into the black.
The Letna team, pumped with new multi-million-dollar reinforcements, is thus ending after the opening doubles match in the European Cups.
Was it difficult to do anything else with the match after the goal of Belgrade?
After the goal, it was necessary to score four, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, to raise our confidence, to have something to bounce back from into the next matches.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta get into the match for so long?
The game is terribly worked.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we shot maybe once in half-time.
That's very little, of course, when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent into positions like this more often.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the lineup?
Of course, this is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We've only played three competitive matches and the line-up is still changing.
The point is for the coach to find the perfect eleven to sit down.
Is there an encouragement to you that you've already played parts of two games in a row?
It's still just part of the match.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I could play from the start.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's the same with an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta have made some decision, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but left embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
There was an amazing visit again, as well as with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Do something that will make them come next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember visits like this when I played here fifteen years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far we are fighting with ourselves, we are playing together, so it is not such an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected a complaint by businessman Jiří Toman, who is to serve ten years in prison for tax cuts to a large extent.
The damage is 645 million crowns.
In the complaint, Toman argued that the justices violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
However, the constitutional judges described the complaint as unfounded, the Czech News Agency found from the court's database.
The Court is not another appeals court.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess the factual or legal errors allegedly committed by the general courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the order reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was upheld by the High Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in extradition detention in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was located even at the time of the decision of the ÚS.
The imposed punishment is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the resulting damage.
The High Court called the case extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of 645 million crowns was incurred only for the period from January to July 2008, according to the expert, the total leak exceeded a billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise tax payments in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, she paid taxes in just hundreds of thousands.
World Service and some of the companies that the company has traded with are related to entrepreneur Radomír Vybíral, to whom the judiciary has assessed 13 years in prison for VAT machinations in fuel trades.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court some time ago.
The series "Summer to Not Live" and "Comrade Detective" play the nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters of the famous 1980s and the dirty of the 90’s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch “The State”) on MTV; and, of course, for modern times, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd ran to bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and also the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of permanent memories.
From the franchise's point of view, however, it seems that someone is running out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not just because of the absurd humor (an example of this may be the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetables voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors moved away from the main funny point - middle-aged actors playing teenage horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later," in which adults play adults don't push so much on the emotional level and satire is sometimes sporadic, including a parody of thrillers from the 90's as "The Hand on the Crib."
At one point, the character finds on a pile of junk the Apple Powerbook, roller skates and "a lot of other things from 1991."
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
The kind-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't moved over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a panic.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is fueled by George H. W. Bush (very well occupied by Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to watch the eternally young Rudd with his long hair, aka Matt Dillon's character from the film Youth, whose once-respectful character Andy is now behind the old peppers.
The franchise could be triggered by moments of accidental madness, such as the returning "Seven Up" series, until it achieves what I suppose will be a logical denouement: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene the whole group will embark on the premiere of "Years to Survival."
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to a different type of nostalgia: the revivalism of the Cold War series "Such Normal Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde: No Regret" and even the "GLOW" series, in which the icons of the eastern and western wrestling scene collide.
The comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandr Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, which they nabbed the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
For some jokes, you laugh (like police officers watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series has been bestowed by many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" is focused on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes a killer with a Reagan mask - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too long and there are not enough comedy moments.
With a shorter impact, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose hall two fat people devour the hamburgers stacked on a large pile.
A clear message to the imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as we did with theirs.
Russian athletes have not seen the ban on launches from the IAAF.
The International Athletics Federation (IAAF) at the Congress in London has confirmed the extension of the international ban on the start of Russian competitors due to a state-sponsored doping program.
The vote in the venue of the World Championship, which will begin on Friday, was very clear as expected.
There were 166 delegates to extend the ban, with only 21 against.
The main reason for the rejection is the fact that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as the head of the special investigative group IAAF Rune Andersen said before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been interviewed, and coaches with a damaged reputation are still working in the country.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the World Anti-Doping Agency standards, is not yet fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"While progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," IAAF chairman Sebastian Coe said.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, and Russian athletes lost last year’s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians who have previously shown that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time will participate in the upcoming World Championships.
At the championship, however, they will not be able to start in national colors and in case of victory they will not play the Russian anthem.
England bank to hold interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by lackluster economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has suffocated speculation about sharp growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "in the background" in the wake of keeping the interest rate - despite squeezing family budgets.
Policy officials of the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote for the interest rate increase supported lack of significant economic growth, supported by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, warning that family budget cuts would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank indicated that growth should occur over the next few years as a result of Brexit inflation, and also said that rents from movabilities should rise more than expected in financial markets.
Committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, whose job was to boost the economy, and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Term Funding Plan should start to apply from next February, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England said it would now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: "The MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on household real incomes and the burden of consumption."
On the subject of rates, the bank said it would be necessary to "tighten the belts of monetary policy" to calm inflation, "at a higher rate" than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "limited."
The bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next year, compared with 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
Expected growth in 2018 of 1.8% remained unchanged.
After the release of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to preserve the status quo came after a disappointing increase buried hopes of further growth - GDP halted to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% from the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly by the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report is a slight consolation for households affected by rising inflation and a miserable pay rise. The bank said the situation would get worse before the increase.
The report goes on to say that the money policy "can't prevent" a reduction in revenue in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise "significantly" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to the high interest in British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset a lower percentage of consumer spending.
That decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025 per cent last August in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that a full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rise in rates, along with rising inflation, which put increasing pressure on households. Three policymakers demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from June's 2.9%, despite the bank saying it expected such a change and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The bank said exceeding relative to 2% of the target was "completely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only rise once lenders start competing for contracts with a look at a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those whose existing contracts and re-mortages end - there are options without fees on offer, as are the low rates they earn."
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10 000 patients
Patients will have access to 'transformative' treatments for HIV prevention from September on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision to fund the drug NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to fund the probationary period after the appeals court backed the Supreme Court's decision last year, saying the NHS had funds to pay for PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by the NHS of England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018, full implementation across England will take place.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among at-risk patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there are a sufficient number of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics shall identify eligible participants who will sign consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GPs in the UK can also apply in their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will come to taxpayers at £10 million and NHS England signed a drug distribution contract this week after winning an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: 'This important intervention should complement and fully work the ever-expanding and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in a more than thirty-year effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: 'We are witnessing a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and at risk to patients, it will offer the possibility of a change in the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, chief executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: 'The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure its availability to each patient.
We now have the PrEP test drug at our disposal and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10 000 people at risk of contracting HIV.'
Shadow Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible across the country, protecting people who are exposed to HIV and together end the spread of HIV in society.'
High-legged life: mezzanine and smart design turned this little apartment into an Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, traded a big house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment on Earls Cour.
Located on the first floor of the smart terrace Queen Anne - and is an illustrative example of modern design, which uses maximum available space.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge neighborhood," Joanne said in a statement.
“I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I came across this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I immediately fell in love with him, and I nodded to him the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage compartments and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and plenty of light.
That was my demands," she said.
To that end, she employed Erfan Azadi of the design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used the nearly four-foot ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that two gaps would fit above each other - the challenge for the architects was to create a mezzanine on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is quite complicated,” he explained.
“We had to organize both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that it would be at the right height above and below the ceiling.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-size rooms on top of each other - while adding to the dramatics.
On the mezzanine floor, he overlooks the wonderful living room with old copper window frames in the retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver line and a retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in the drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage compartments equipped with mirrors for storing cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen, if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, are the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced veneered door.
“The door is provided with counterweights to be very easy to remove.”
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne got another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to that, what you're selling is the living area - or the valuation of your property," Erfan said.
“A real estate agent basically calculates its price based on the living area when entering the apartment.”
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while maintaining high-quality materials that lend the space a luxurious appearance.
“The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with home,” Erfan said.
“You don’t love the electricity distribution in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts will not be won.”
As it turned out, a quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can eventually choose to stay.
The United States is disintegrating.
The cultural and political divide between blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee repaid her and declared a retaliatory ban on her citizens' travel to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, the citizens of the United States can travel freely across all fifty states.
California has banned the use of government money for the travels of its citizens to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop the madness?
California is strongly for LGBT, and any show of disagreement with LGBT lifestyles is considered discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed a law on the reservation of conscience, according to which a psychotherapist, who has a moral problem with the therapy of patients from the LGBT community, has no obligation to provide it, but has a duty to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws that religious charities that received babies from mothers after birth for adoption are not obliged to provide these children for adoption to same-sex couples.
Because of these laws on reservation of conscience, California has banned the financing of the travel of its citizens to eight states of the union from its means.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to travel to science symposiums, for example, in Texas reimbursed from their universities because they are co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They must receive either federal grants for travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance citizens’ travel from State A to State B or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience, and his parliament has passed a law with a resolution that he also doesn't like California's high-tax policy, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but he's not posing a travel embargo on California.
He's imposing them as retaliation for a California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen against any state of the union that would impose a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they are not allowed to do.
Second, what's wrong with a reservation of conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under penalty of punishment, force him to sell pork, when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In the state of Colorado, one baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a hefty fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policy in powers that are not federal, according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their inhabitants.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California could be California, and Texas could be Texas.
But California wants California to be California, and Texas, and seven other states are California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and let live, which should be governed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one must ever again show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do so, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I do not know the situation in American history, when states on such intentions, except in the case of one, on such a way.
Even in times of struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1950s, the political case was slavery and the North's war against the South was brewing.
Of course, there is no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue-democrat states and the red republican states is deepening, and the U.S. is becoming mentally intrinsically disconnected.
Unauthorized agitation.
A critic of Putin has been given a greasy fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300 thousand rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of presidential elections next year.
The court imposed a fine on him for calling on people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced that he wants to run for head of state in March next year.
The Kremlin's acting chief, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said police came to his house in the morning and took him to the court.
He was fined for calling on people to demonstrate through videos posted on the YouTube portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll later take them off the judge's salary," a Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
Russia's electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
Navalny, who is considered a campaigner against corruption, however, considers the sentence to be politically motivated.
On Thursday, the court also imposed fines of 300 thousand rubles on two members of the Navalny campaign team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
Authorities are trying to defend Navalny in every way possible in the campaign.
He was sentenced in February to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the forestry business of Kirovles.
In May, the verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The sentence is thus final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight for over 500 million dollars in empire
The two brothers are now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, are tugging at one of Victoria's most expensive properties worth more than 500 million dollars.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides on the Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who drove the dispute over common property and business fortunes to the high court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly being laundered before the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the family founded Westco Jeans, a company that has grown into a chain with 160 brick-and-mortar stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for 85 million dollars.
With the money, other properties were bought, and the De Lutis family's portfolio now includes offices, building land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father, Colin, who, in Paul's words, is a "significant driving force and dominant figure" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
Court files state that Colin owns properties worth $316 million while Paul manages properties for $176 million.
It was the division of property and funds that became problematic for Paul.
"Colin's proposal sounded significantly in his favour in my eyes," Paul wrote in a sworn sworn statement in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the supreme court was held.
The brothers are now also competing over who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his statement, Colin cut off.
Colin contradicts that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some properties.
In a previous sworn statement, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates to me that family is the most important thing," he wrote.
The cost of courtship is rising. Hundreds of sites of affidavits, emails and messages from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC and defense attorneys of both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who have been running milk bars and treats since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With money raised by the pledge of the property, they bought the property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was still a small, about ten-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that, along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped the transfer of the property to her sons would take place after a good time.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family's group of companies. Colin said Mark was compensated with a $10 million in damages and Luke a $26 million in damages.
As Paul, Luke and Mark put it, "they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has been holding back since then, despite the fact that he is a former board member of the AFL, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend of Colin, said in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded by text message, in which he stated that given the fact that the dispute is being resolved before the court, "I have nothing to add to it."
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to deal with the matter before the court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements in court, Colin said he was trying to adapt to his brother's demands.
“Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a successful solution.”
On Friday, all hopes were in sight.
"Our disputes will resolve court hearings soon," Colin wrote.
Heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers enjoy water and summer clothes.
In the kindergarten Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children now attend, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There's no swimming pool, but the teachers shower in the fog little.
In the afternoon, children remain in classrooms where blinds are pulled down and curtains closed.
The air is trying to cool down with an air purifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It is also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is both indoor and outdoors, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open operation during this period," said Miloslava Makovičková, the headmaster of the kindergarten.
There is a glass corridor in the nursery, where, according to her, the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We air out in the morning after 6 o'clock, the windows close and we have blinds on the south sides that we protect ourselves with.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have grown trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree, there is a table under it, and there we do different things," Barbora Kompanová, the headmistress of the nursery, described.
Teachers try to go to the woods with the children, where there is more cool.
Children's wet hats and have various games of water on the program.
"We have a handheld pressure sprayer that's used for spraying flowers, and we're using it to shower babies," Ms. Kompan said.
Jitka Vilimovská, the head of the kindergarten in Novoborská street in Prague’s Prosek, also said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly mature garden, so they're under the trees there," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a headgear.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or diluted juice, and have a drink with water in the garden.
They also have a vegetable salad to eat every day, and fresh fruits and vegetables for snacks, which are sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Maybe today one mother brought about ten kilos of watermelon for children," Makovičková added.
Drivers receive water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic beverages or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of tram and bus drivers are air-conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
So far, the high temperatures have not been seriously damaged by the tram tracks.
Minor damage occurred in a loop in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks.
"The chilled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and depots," Ms. Řehková said.
In the depots and in some alternate places, employees have so-called sodobars, which produce a cooled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ionic beverages.
"They can also use a summer uniform that enhances the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the whole of the Czech Republic disposed of 108, i.e. twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during a day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed more than 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters mainly employed the fight against fire.
"Fires in the natural environment prevail and also those associated with harvest works," fire department spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral said.
The relief of the firefighters was not even brought by the evening change in the weather, when the heat in many places was replaced by thunderstorms and torrential rainfall.
In connection with the storms, firefighters drove to 236 hits.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
However, the help of firefighters was also needed in Stvolínky in the Českolipsko region, where due to the storm they evacuated to the safety of 60 people from the children's camp.
Tropical temperatures have also given work to Prague's rescuers.
On Tuesday and night on Wednesday, ambulances drove to a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from kara.
Therefore, people should have their water heaters inspected, rescuers warn.
Carbon oxide is a colorless odorless gas that is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling like a faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infested room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb president's media diet
Many tried before him and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If so, he will be the first.
The Politico portal said the new chief of staff at the White House plans to limit President Trump's flow of information - including reports on television news - in hopes of keeping Trump at the surface.
Here's part of reporter Josh Dawsey's report:
"When the new chief of staff of the White House, John F. Kelly met his first day in a new role with employees, outlining the key issue of Trump's White House, which he intends to correct: incorrect information that is getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told employees that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or the word of speech - because the president could make a better decision based on the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have broken their teeth to control Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump, as a candidate, was upset by honest reports, it was fitting to show him that a lot of other media outlets were talking about him in a positive light, which was easier to convince," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri, of Politico, wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets at bay - at least in the words of six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that sings praises on him."
Okay. Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his views on Twitter was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't checked out.
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump has never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him at bay at least a few times, then their efforts did not go to waste.
But no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from instigating controversial topics.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by pushing Trump's materials - that may or may not be reliable - that support their worldview.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, in May published a report on the inclination of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Trump’s current and former officials say the president often reacts very angry to negative media reports, especially the information leak reports, and seeks to find their origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February, when someone slipped a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the 'source of many leaks' of information from the White House.
Regardless, Johnson was forever banned from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not back up his claim with any evidence; or that he had already made false accusations in the past and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and began to ask about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then-Staff Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump will receive."
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later trying to push through the same strategy.
It may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just fade away, and his helpers still compete for power.
These unchanging factors will certainly make Kelly's mission more difficult.
Tourists negotiate a ditch and return to 'Millionaire' neighborhood'
Several of the most wealthy homeowners in England's West Midland county are once again embarking on a move with determined tourists negotiating with local authorities over the rights to regain the field behind their mansions.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field by a booming street in the town of Solihull, which is nicknamed the 'millionaire's neighborhood'.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being banished in May. They were not afraid of the moat, which was excavated on the spot on the basis of orders of the authorities in order to prevent their incursion.
The tactful group found gaps in defence and penetrated the field with the caravans through an unprotected gap that served beyond the road.
The angry residents of the neighborhood attacked the board of Solihull, saying it 'is unable to solve the problem'.
One of the residents, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'They occupied the place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw rocks at other people.
The Board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they have returned.
More arrived last night, and today there will probably be more.'
She added that : ‘Birmingham’s board of directors knows how to deal with this issue. He uses court orders to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't want to pay taxes until the board of directors deals with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said, “It’s ridiculous. Just recently we watched the last departing tourists and now they are back.
And this time there are more, and this time they brought their horses with them.'
Solihull, the city's board of directors, said: 'We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to successfully resolve the issue.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any non-social or illegal behavior to the police at number 101.
This will give us the overall picture that we will present in court.'
The husband of the MEP was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
The government special transported the injured Róbert Zitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under constant control of Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
According to TV JOJ, Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He said he was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After transport to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from NOVA.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians toughen up fighting NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving on the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which significantly eases illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which is operating for the first year, declined to comment on the matter on the grounds of allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
“For us, the number one priority is to save people’s lives. We are therefore very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones," the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only comment on all the current accusations after gathering all the information and evaluating the situation.”
Italian authorities have been tracking the Iuventa ship of the Jugend Rettet organization since October.
Her crew is suspected of having transported immigrants on the ship, which was handed over directly to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting occurred, according to the plaintiff's file, reportedly only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya. The meeting was published by Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian coast guard, who oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental nonprofits involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organization said Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable because they did not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" in terms of rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct was also rejected by the organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which is the winner of the Nobel Prize.
Minniti, meanwhile, has said that the sharp drop in immigrants in recent weeks, which has been disembarking in Italy as part of rescue operations, suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors bears fruit.
"In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
It also revealed plans for further negotiations, which will take place this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Shameless Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulite were coming out of her overalls!
Hot summer days completely attract you to wear only the most necessary things that will cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does the other way around.
At the afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where the actors, presenters, singers and all those who have something to do with TV Prima, just teemed, her body wrapped in a mini jumpsuit.
And it only took a few normal movements, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her butt.
The jumper cut between the halves, and it was so high that she had to adjust it all the time.
She was certainly not short of the attention of the gentlemen and photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages prompting Conrad Roy suicide
The Massachusetts woman was sentenced to imprisonment of two years for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide by text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of her two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of involuntary killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13. July 2014.
Roy's father testified in court on Thursday: "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left free until the decision.
She was facing up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse, Carter stood in place in place at the announcement of the verdict with tears in her eyes, clasped hands and eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
“She ended his life to relieve herself.
She was unable to accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She showed no regrets."
But Carter's attorney said it was "unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder do not have a significant impact on her actions."
The applicant read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, "There will be no day for me not to mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever," the statement said.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "persecuted" by the knowledge that she would never attend his brother's wedding and would never be his children's aunt.
“The loss of the person I’ve seen since I was born is a pain I’ll carry with me for life,” she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law that would punish a person helping to commit suicide of another person. This is therefore a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in 2014 in the seat of a car, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published, which incited suicide.
"Maybe a tinge, jump off a building or stab myself, I don't care," the text messages Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote to him, “You have to do it Conrade” and “Just turn on the generator and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter longed for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted of charges.
Ms. Knox (30) posted a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison."
Audi to adjust up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi carmaker BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the seat of BMW - that are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European automakers have promoted large-scale use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to comply with the Carbon Dioxide Regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the costs of installing equipment for the installation of equipment are increasing to neutralize the gases issued by diesel engines, which makes it difficult to compete with cars.
While German automakers face close searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen, which in an effort to meet emission limits installed software in its cars, which reduced the amount of emissions issued during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been charged in the United States and the others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics of the engine development department in Audi would be arrested in Germany.
Former Zaccheo manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is therefore not subject to extradition, so he may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi engaged in a criminal investigation into the German police in the Volkswagen case after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission limits - extending the charges that Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may have a detrimental impact on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker makes up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
The man and the little girl were killed.
The accident occurred on Praia de São João beach in the Costa da Caparica area, roughly 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the TV channel SIC Noticias said the plane was flying just above people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly ran from danger into the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead at the scene," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them were out of the accident alive and officers took them for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are the motorways in the Czech Republic complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unfinished, even though it started to be built in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is that?
Yes, the D11 motorway in Hradec Králové.
The construction of another section of its section has been newly stopped by the Children of the Earth movement for at least a few months.
We East Bohemians get the highway in pieces, like when salami is cut.
The wheel is cut, and then we're just to see when and if we get another one.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the journey time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or Poland from villages and towns.
The endless currents of trucks go directly through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not a reasonable way around.
However, the last section of our dream highway was opened in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a knock since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové were recently built and the archaeological survey began on the other sections to Jaroměř, with the construction starting at the end of this year, you could hear a loud banging of the earplugs in eastern Bohemia.
I mean, no one believed it anymore.
Last week turned out not to be built this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has filed a decomposition.
Children of the Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They challenged the decision on building permits in their entirety.
In disarray, they call for a review of all the already issued binding opinions of all the institutions concerned.
For example, the Hradec Králové Municipality, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far, we are coming from D11 near the village with the eloquent name Funneral.
So we go down, we just drive on the highway and suddenly we stand on the side road and we prefer to subsequently join the motorcade.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the country.
A terrifying, constantly clogged road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone has their own Funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth demand?
What are the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually unfinishable in the current system?

Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the south-eastern France region, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to dry climates and harmful insects, causing dismay on the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "Growing lavender in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in the spring and autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
Cicadas and grasshoppers that transmit micro-bacteria, which thrive in dry climates, are also to blame for this."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists, and the oil that is made from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil derived from these lavenders is, of course, less.”
A possible solution may be more efficient water distribution and slowing down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
Journalist's murder highlights growing threats in Mexico
Employees of the weekly Riodoce meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the riots that are taking place in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials and unfailing drug wars.
Today, however, under the onslaught of recent events, it meets mainly for its own safety.
They learn that it is important that they change their habits.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that someone attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to give names for each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foreboding.
Choosing them from what - drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose job it is to cover up criminal conduct.
The violence continues, and bodies are piling up across the country; journalists among them are steadily increasing: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there have been at least 25 since President Enrique Pen Niet came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven states, seven have been killed this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the periodical Ridioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence linked to the drug trade.
His loss is noticeable, although his presence is all-pervasive - a large photo of Valdez with the inscription "Justice," on which he points the middle finger, hangs in the facade of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over the age of 30, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama cap.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, it has so far sued two suspects, according to a statement from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. The killers of journalists are very rarely in court.
Journalists from Riodoka insist on reporting on the violence that is happening in Sinaloa; even though they are destroyed by grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and no vision of justice, the security meeting is groundless, Ibarra says.
“It’s foolish to waste time on meetings like this,” he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, no one can be trusted.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce headquarters in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to escape several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 missiles, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the 12th River.
The shooters then boarded his car and crashed him not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
It seems that in Culiacan, rumors are spreading fast.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzmán and his January extradition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions try to fill the void.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is full of embellished two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “truce” means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, is still abusing him from not protecting his friend.
He believes two misconducts contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with Joaquín Guzman's sons.
The reconciliation could have made the sons angry; the suspected gang members bought up all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of other newspapers in which the same story was published.
Valdez has become a legend in both Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that this would never change.
In the Noroeste periodical, he was virtually a veteran when he decided in 2003 to sell his $50-worth stock and set up along with five of Riodoce's colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without mentioning the drug trade," Bojorquez said.
In time, the Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and true news; the newspapers began to thrive.
Journalists liked to embark on a search for problematic topics and published texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for her report on Latin America.
The same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for his brave coverage of the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was scared.
“I was afraid for my life,” he said at the award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "way of life," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist – or play stupid.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What did you do face to face with death... why didn’t you say what was going on?’”
The employees of Riodoca miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guyaybo bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about their own assumptions - how to do his job in the best possible way and stay alive?
"They don't like you when you get involved with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You must trust your instincts.
If you feel something is not playing out here, hands off.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce, Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then that thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, according to him, as others say, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggle trails, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief in front of forty-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the town district of Culiacan.
Journalists are making fun of whether these police officers are among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials who are corrupt, according to the government.
It has been several months since journalists last ventured into mountainous areas that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also have an enlightenment for suspicious government spending that took place in the state governor's hometown.
There have also recently been several kidnappings in one of the most luxurious restaurants of the Culiacán, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one has reported the identities of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were on the lookout to being prepared to write about what every resident of the city knows: that the restaurant is a popular destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene almost all of the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with corruption in senior posts.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about earlier incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín's "El Chapo" Guzman's sons escaped the army's task force.
Just a month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly have cracked the case," said Villarreal, 46, who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protests against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly didn't expect them to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and went to demonstrate the following morning in front of the prosecutor's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a charred body was discovered. Authorities say it is Adamea based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is escalating across the country. Many of them organize protests and scribble on the sidewalks and buildings of the "SOS press."
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez is visiting Washington on a day where he is trying to win international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, which took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of tracking journalists and their murder for proclaiming the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked to be transferred to another department out of concern that her anger could jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said Mexican journalists are "byended" by organized crime, corrupt officials and the indifferent public.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists are dying not only by the hand of drug cartels, but also by ordering politicians and security forces working with organized crime.
Media surveillance group Articulo 19 has charged with more than half of all attacks on journalists by police officers and public officials.
"You're going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders are clearly working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who occurred six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages."
Next to the severed head lay a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to cease operations, such as the newspaper El Norte, based near the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Breachová.
Others are still continuing, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing their director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the publicly drug cartels with an article on the front page titled “What do you want from us”?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who have chosen to stay and not give up their job, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is heading to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It's Friday midnight and the Riodoce employee is sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing in it.
They learn that 19 people have died in a shootout between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in the city of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many of the messages left behind in the area by members of the syndicate promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a day goes by and the opening credit is changing again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez gives a glimpse of the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for the whole of Sinaloa - all the employees of Riodoce follow his steps.
"How could we think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when one of the interns asked me to send me to the streets on the same day that Javier was killed?"
The dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
The researchers have now uncovered the findings of the first findings of an amazing creature about the size of a rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts have called 'Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs' - was found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high extent that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scaly skin and said the dinosaur had a 'problematic past'.
A paper in the journal Current Biology said it was 'the best-preserved some of the dinosaur's ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers, who described him in the words of 'really remarkable'.
The armored white-eater is, according to National Geographic, the best preserved fossil of its kind.
Behind the find is Shawn Funk, who uncovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling at the Suncor Millennium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After the work is complete, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
'Just narrow your eyes a little and you'll believe he's asleep,' said work manager Caleb Brown and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the animal is on display.
“It will surely go down in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of the dinosaur – the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in tingling and resembled a walking tank - was in all likelihood facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that many of today's animals use.
Experts say this has allowed him to blend better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests it was a favorite food for larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110-million-year-old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in a newspaper in May. It is currently available for inspection at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who, along with the team, spent more than 7000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists document the patterns and shape of scales and tingling all over the body.
They revealed a method of camouflage commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred masking to confrontation in survival.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - such as deer, zebra and or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its outlived.
“The prediction of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the danger posed by predators during the Cretaceous period,” Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that dinosaur skin probably had a reddish-brown coloration.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for more insights into his life, including the preserved stomach content, to track down his last meal.
He believes the dinosaur fell into the river after his death and was carried into the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
In the Alberta region at the time, the climate was the same as in present-day Florida, and the rivers and oceans stretched farther inland than they are today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while also being preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as it did in the time of the chalk.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just need to narrow your eyes a little, and it seems like he's just asleep.'
In the Cretaceous period, huge teropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, were walking on the Earth, moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - the Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been the favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-meter-long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe the body of Borealopelt was washed up into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Behind the find is Shawn Funk, who uncovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling at a Suncor Millennium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is additionally complete from muzzle to hips.
The animal reached a diameter of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm of barb protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe this herbivore has ridden the territory of present-day Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the skin residues.
As Michael Greshko wrote to National Geographic, “the finding of such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the shocking the find seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the skin residues.
At his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her entire body.
The day after she arrived in New York, with a native of St. Louis sat on a bed in an Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across the contribution of a high school student.
"The police have just shot the 18-year-old, whose body is still lying in the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else had written this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her wall posts.
Rapper from St. Louis posted on Twitter his posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man who was shot by a white-skinned police officer in the city of Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying lifeless on the street, from where no one took him even after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her phone to return to him in the evening, watching tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
She watched photos of police tapes and screaming people. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign in his hand with the words "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live reports - one of the police officers stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another police officer, as she stated, held a gun in his hand, with which he was aiming at the crowd and yelling, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell said to herself.
"This is not the kind of murder we've been used to and that we can call normal.
I could feel the goose bumps all over my body.
“I was angry and I cried.”
She immediately booked a return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to head to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described in a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", which will be released in cinemas on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protests, love and resistance, the power and resentment told from the perspective of people living in the community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral headband - about a topic they had discussed many times before - "about the experience with blacks."
“Do you remember when I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?”
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old youth and that's not right."
"It wasn't an option for me not to take her with me," Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the climax... that has occurred in the past.
She had to know and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
It needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but at the same time it had to know the difference between different layers of experience with black people and what we need to do to get free.
Despite the fact that I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism firsthand, she is no different from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would just hurt her.”
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop of the South Florissant Road was across from the police department, which became the base of activists who were expecting the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his eventual involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for others.
Together they prepared food for the bags and helped to distribute it to the Protestants.
A new type of activism slowly began to be born in Ferrell's eyes.
"My activism was turned upside down after August 9," Ms Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the documentary's later co-director, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "only document" the ongoing events.
Ferrell, however, thought, "Are you working on a documentary or trying to find a story that could be used?"
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to profit from pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We have heard that the voices of people who are born and grow up in Ferguson are very often neglected and that's what we wanted to change."
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners on death row.
His participation in the project also involved Ferrell and, along with six other locals, who were followed by the "Whose Streets" team in the years following the assassination of Brown.
"Nobody speaks for us in this document, but it's our testimony," Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people would be represented - because I would be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the documentary was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in trying to portray that the movement "is not about a savior leader, but about bringing the community closer together," Ms Folayan said - it turned out that she was the most open to participating in filmmaking.
The documentary “Whose Streets?” describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face at the thought of the first moment she watched the final version of the documentary.
"But I understand that in order to do this work and humanize the blacks, I have to open up."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created a campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media - call themselves weirdos.
"Black eccentric women in leadership positions ultimately stand behind the preservation of the movement," Ms Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with that statement, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a mere affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary because of her views.
"She was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"that she's on the front lines is no coincidence, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You can feel the rush of energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the cameras of television stations have vacated their positions, but heavy racial bonds between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year probation for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
The socially political atmosphere in the area she calls home described as "a mess."
Still, she continues her quest, which she has committed to since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we have to lose is our chains.”
There was a field burning in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, a helicopter was also helped.
Near Český Brod in the Kolín region, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field with an area of about 15 hectares was burning from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15 a.m., firefighters declared a third-degree fire alarm out of four possible.
According to fire department spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, a helicopter also helped to extinguish the fire from the air.
At 18:00, the firefighters managed to put out the fire, the fire caused damage for 700000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and voluntary firefighters were battling the flames at the scene.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the harvester.
The firefighter was also assisted by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six water drops.
"Instead of the intervention, we handed over to the owner, until tomorrow 8:00 a.m. will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery is located several faces of different skin tones - white, black and dark - hung from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them seemed to fall out of the previous one's eye.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from swabs from the mouth and hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized disclosure of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, launched on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning - a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before his departure from the post of president of the United States.
The algorithmic DNA analysis of Manning's DNA and the use of 30 portraits to illustrate what a man with this genotype would look like was created by Dewey-Hagborg's razor-sharp, if not intellectual, commentary on DNA malleability - as well as many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken since her youth that she considers herself a woman. She was sentenced in 2013 on the basis of 20 indictments, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photos were taken by prison staff. Only one lower-quality black-and-white photograph leaked to the public, on which Manning, visibly concerned, is sitting in the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wig, which she is now associated with.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project of Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were planning an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits and photographs were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if she would be interested in DNA portraits.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
President Obama actually asked for Manning's release a few days after the comics were released, which was a welcome change after several excruciating years spent in a Kansas military prison.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place just as Donald Trump is waging war on people seeking to disclose government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to incite grudges with his tweets in areas he should support.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said "everything is happening for a reason."
Under the statement of the artist on one of the gallery walls, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter “i” in the surname is dotted with the heart) after the end of “self-feeding factionalism, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.”
On the opposite side are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a centipede of the letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are.
“I hope that people will take away from this, that our genome doesn’t care who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way,” said Dewey-Hagborg. Her work Spurious Memories from 2007 on video can also be seen.
“DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them.”
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novel.
She depicts Manning emerging in the manner of King Kong from the United States Displinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in her hand.
"As soon as they stop you from speaking, they will win," it says.
"Never be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - which was predicted in the comics - but when it does, she will be greeted in the center of the room with her masks, her own genomic portraits, lined up as a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm high statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"They were placed on the walls in the past, but this time I wanted them to make a sense of crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and frees it.”
Northwest University professor and Oxford University employee sought for murder
These days, a nationwide search is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff who are being prosecuted for suspected murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, an arrest warrant was issued for first-degree murder against a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to Cook County's court file.
The document says Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found 27. July.
Police were alerted to this fact by telephone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with multiple lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide. Police, meanwhile, are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwest University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in a statement emailed: "We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the US police as well."
The statement also says Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole fact and wish he had turned himself in to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations with the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on suspects to surrender to the appropriate authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and the effort to find the suspects is escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and nationwide authorities were assisting police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to events that were supposed to take place in apartment No. 1008.
Police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on 27. July.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: "The police are now working to compile a timesheet and the victim's profile and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
“In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan” – Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the rest of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
"At present, part of the criteria of the new plan has been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this in mind, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan for compliance with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of the validity of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutek, the code does not contain anything that should worry Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly," he added.
One of the criteria, however, calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation investigated by Richard McLaren about the alleged sponsorship of doping by Russian athletes by the government.
On the subject, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot confess to something that never existed."
Mutka's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "On many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of bringing up doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
After a visit to Moscow's headquarters in July, WADA's chief executive, Olivier Niggli, said RUSADA was "on the right track" to resume validity.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with setting a rare wooden church in Třinec-Guty in the Frýdecko-Místecko region on Wednesday.
One accused is a juvenile, all three are Czech nationals.
They face up to 15 years in prison for the crime of general endangerment.
The Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told journalists today.
It was an intentional crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive for the whole matter," Kuzel said.
He said police would discuss the possible detention of the accused.
Further information cannot be disclosed, according to the Director.
"I can't say more yet because the criminal police and investigation and the prosecutor's office, who is supervising the matter, are actually working on the matter," Kuzel said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Gutech dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, the material damage will go to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the restoration of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance, the Ministry of Culture and the city are ready to share the additional costs, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by a fire fifteen years ago.
It was caused by a fault in the wiring.
In his place, an exact copy was made.
The state counts on citizens to defend the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for associations usable in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training supervisors, the factual intention of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state counts.
The Ministry of Defence, which received its processing from the government, promises from him that it will be possible to increase the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is according to a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns in support of the military.
The basic objective of the proposal, according to its authors, is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the performance of military duty and on the basis of voluntary.
For example, the state would financially or material support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, it would get data on people who are willing to come to the country in times of crisis for help if necessary, and about their abilities or material equipment.
There could also be accredited instructors who would help associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It also counts on organizing talks with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be established to handle the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their abilities only after the declaration of the state of threat.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats," the project said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the broadest possible set of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic objective of the intention is to create a very broad base that will allow each citizen to respond skillfully to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, protect themselves, or contribute to the protection of others, and not make it difficult to perform tasks with the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the intention states.
Passing the law would bring considerable financial claims.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen option.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns a year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also foresees that the competence of the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, which together would employ an additional 42 soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union directive on gun ownership.
It would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons forbidden by the directive.
Startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but did not find adequate research.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even deceptive.
And yet she promised the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust throughout the process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of Madison Reed, an e-commerce company based in San Francisco that employs 75 people.
She asked for help from outside.
New human resources startups are constantly emerging on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intention of measuring employee obligations, startups allow companies to make quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, and offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow informants to bypass supervisors and contact the director directly.
“There are tools in the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint, a Reedwood City-based startup.
Errett said she has gained more awareness of what her employees think and feel in three years thanks to Glint.
In addition to rapid surveys and voting specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a cursory overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with a low rating - allowing the user to work on the remedy.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the work environment - in case they become another Uber - which is buffeted by scandals after a former employee posted on his blog a post describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys presents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
The startup Convercent of Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw little increase in interest and activity at the start of the year, just before Uber's scandals.
Nearly 600 Convercent clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has also adopted under its wing.
Similar to Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “lightning” surveys, collect confidential information in real-time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the issue, the complaints shall be sent directly to the Board of Directors.
"The Court of Public Opinion has empowered regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of the startup Convercent.
If a company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical conduct - and if regulators do not intervene - it may face costly consequences as a result of boycotting customers, staff exhaustion or legal proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employee awareness of corporate policies and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace the phone number or email to the company management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general counsel of Ruby Tuesday, according to which there was previously no reliable way of monitoring employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, it is ensured to quickly detect and resolve problems that have never previously reached managers sitting in offices, miles away from a real-life solution to complaints - for example, discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It's coming to a holistic, overall view of the experience of employees," said Vitrano, who run Ruby Tuesday's group overseeing risk management.
“At the same time, we protect shareholders from lawsuits by employees.”
The companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron's downfall in the abuse of employee ethics rights, Quinlan said.
But it was only when social media “shone a light on the whole thing” that companies began to realize that in the online world they could not simply hide their skeletons in their closet.
“Before people started using technology to track ethics, people were relying on the faith,” Quinlan said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity endorsed by the brave capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent collected a total of $10 million as part of his February campaign from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually took home a capital of $47 million.
Glint earned $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of societies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, not the main advantage of high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to perceive that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits from both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money if companies thrive and companies thrive if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool emerges in the market that ensures employee engagement and commitment to the company, it’s no wonder that there are plenty of investors who will support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The reality is that once the company asks for feedback from its employees, there can be major changes.
And if change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and lack of interest to employees.
"Once you ask for 4000 opinions, you need to be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, which has witnessed many companies that have relied too heavily on the data itself.
“Since once you don’t finish things, the staff will start to wonder, ‘Did they even hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should I care?'" "
Madison Reed, which now conducts a survey of employees on a regular basis every month, can solve the problem within a day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and communication quality, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start training communications to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the industry in the long run, which is known for frequent layoffs.
“If you’re not trying to create a transparent work environment, employees won’t trust you,” Vitrano said.
"And once you start losing employees, you'll lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt.”
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region.
He surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, there were not many temperature records compared to Tuesday on Thursday.
The heat hit mainly Moravia, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or leveled at 35 out of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, in Strážnice, today's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice in the Brno region the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the biggest heat was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, the highest temperatures today were only around 22 degrees Celsius, according to the CHMI website.
"Temperatures started to rise there later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heatwaves in the Czech Republic will gradually subside, according to the CHMI, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
However, in most places in Moravia, high temperatures will remain on Friday and southeast Moravia and Saturday.
We've had such a mischief here.
Billionaires are not satisfied with the same vote in the election as every one full-time person in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as insolent as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own a state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta, Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water, Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsor Robejšek’s Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in real estate Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
The convict corruptor and king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, has acquired the Private Party.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project of Andrej Babiš was named by the mayor of Kroměříž Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for himself.
The mayors have also recently caught their billionaire.
It is Dalibor Dědek, the owner of the Jablotron security equipment company.
In his own words, he enters politics in order to do good.
But Entrée did not do well in the mayoral jersey.
"I've never dreamed of small goals," he said at a news conference.
That said, my goal is for the Yes movement to get the Mayors movement to win twenty percent in the election.
Some people smiled.
But Grandpa's misrepression is rather symptomatic.
Billionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of firm opinion.
Although he intends to compete for the votes of voters in the Mayors' jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
The grandfather supported Babiš in the past parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule the pleasing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote of it before the 2013 election.
But it certainly doesn’t go into politics because you want to improve yourself personally.
For me, Babiš will remain a hero.
He is willing to step out of his world, which is in control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn to introduce themselves to possible cooperation with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that Dědek does not change his mind and stands by his own, no matter what jersey he wears.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending someone so clumsy to the Mayors to build his B.
Others may wonder if the boss of Jablotron, for example, has broken up with the head of Agrofert in a bad way in the store and is not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
However, Dědek’s first public appearances were not just around Babiš.
The grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayor's campaign.
And if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard to pause for a similar statement.
After all, the court-recognised thug Zdeněk Bakala was throwing millions on all sides before the 2010 election.
The political division of the security agency Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and civic democrats came together to almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
When Grandfather enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Perhaps then he might not wonder why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
He crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for a tax advantage for families with studied children.
People with a university degree come to about fifty thousand a month.
The basics at less than twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in his circumstances.
The one with the twenty poor.
In Dědek’s vision of society, the poor pay their taxes honestly and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state, which they do not participate in.
In short, it is necessary to help the rich not to suffer poverty with need.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš can rub their hands.
Thanks to Grandfather, the rest of us can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question remains of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have members of their party or citizens of the state for their employees and country for their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country for all people, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be discounted by 234 million.
Sometimes selling a property is not easy.
And often it is not helped by 11 bedrooms, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is sold by President Donald Trump.
When selling the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by a whopping 8 million pounds.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says: "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to the place like no other.
But even the merger of the real estate company with the US president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump has had to lower the price of his Caribbean mansion by a whopping 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was 21.5 million pounds, the final price dropped to 13 million pounds.
Even after the sale, the villa complex stands as about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And no wonder.
The stunning 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full-size bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees on the property.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price was reflected in the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around 15 million pounds.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With the new price, however, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at 13.5 million pounds.
The NCAA has decided to put an end to two workouts a day. There are long days for the Bruins
The eleventh morning is approaching, and UCLA University's American football players are squeezing at the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal a sweaty back, an unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most team members, these few minutes of doing nothing will be replaced by a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will retire to rooms after a three-hour training session to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place on the coming morning at 6:30 a.m.
“They’re going to be a good work for these guys for the next three days,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday swung on Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to lighten up the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That's why the first three UCLA workouts are scheduled for 19:15 - to squeeze into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons, which Mora has spent as a coach at Westwood, the Bruins training camp begins a week earlier than last year and training sessions are limited for the summer semester. The decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one a day also has an impact on this.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled until August 20, after which formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September, begin.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's decision, despite adding another item to the already charged player's diary.
"Three or four days the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one gave up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.”
UCLA will be closed after the training camp is over, which will not be easy when looking at the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center hotel, which was occupied by players after harvesting the protective net behind the goal stick.
The Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms empty during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
“The safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking lot No. 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe that everything will turn out well.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook plans to have more thorough fact-checking to limit the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to review third parties and display findings under original posts in an effort to combat so-called "fake news," the largest social network said Thursday.
The company writes on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been described as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe these unconfirmed reports have influenced last year's election of the president of the United States.
There are political debates about the whole issue in Europe. French voters are inundated with an avalanche of fake news about the May presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September election if it does not urgently remove angry posts.
Facebook said in a statement issued in Germany on Thursday that it was planning to launch a new feature of the control of fake news in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying third-party verified reports, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decision about what they can share," Sara Su, Facebook's product news manager, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the "related articles" feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Creating a graphic novel: a story about A Castle in England
The small castle of Scottey Castle recently played the lead role in the music video of the band Squeeze and was also sheltered by Margaret Thatcher during the 70's and 80's of the last century.
Scottey, however, witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from his cosy spot by the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, that inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of the York County - known for his fondness for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
“The sight of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me,” Rhodes says with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection.”
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the life of families who lived at Scottey Castle from the Middle Ages until the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not Rhodes's first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by British Library documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the thumbprint on the letter written by a double agent in the 70's who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his thumbs-up!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
How I love the archives!”
For someone so fascinated by the old papers, the support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to dwell in the castle for almost four months is almost like a dream. (“To tell you the truth, I’ve extended my stay a little.”)
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian “new” castle, browsing through the archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of the hyena on the wall and the bottles that had been dumped in a ditch for centuries.
He walked the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, speaking with the gardeners, gardeners and occasionally also with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night, he “sipped whiskey and wrote.”
Scotney's intimate history is a relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained access to the documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the scene ten years later, the staff were beginning to penetrate the archives that Rhodes had described in words, like “the aristocrats of many centuries throwing their hands around with the words, ‘Put it in the attic.’”
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps depicting property: "You might think the dispute over land is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were tugging at birch.
Stop it people! "
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of the 1380 Castle Rebellion, which was in the book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it’s connected in the end.”
The other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who reportedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was only discovered several years after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes's favorite family is Darrell's: "I was intrigued by the male generation - the men of that time were always indebted and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
The different generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by taking rich or old mistresses - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to hang out the heads of the heirs. "
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is searching for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stage in the Finnish wilderness, where he soaked up inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, a former early 20th-century sanatorium that was swallowed up by nature.
But it's a special place for Scottey.
“I was sad when I left,” he said.
“I was like, ‘Now to get the hell back to real life.’”
Washington changes the terms of the green card
The media has released President Donald Trump's words about a new U.S. immigration plan, which will also change the way he is awarded the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is projected to fall by 50 000 year-on-year due to stricter rules on the issuance of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers. We will achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to the inhabitants of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will favor English-speaking applicants who abound in funds and demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country," Trump said, quoted by the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it seemed like 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sex robots appears on the Internet.
Yes. Yes.
Sex robots are now really popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
In the words of former Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
"People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often," Sharkey said in a statement.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable pan to robotic women with silicone leather, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course there is artificial intelligence, which mimics the behavior of a man.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his own image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
What is very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own “personality” that would shame even the Stepford lady.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into robotic women with silicone leather.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set different character traits for its replacement woman, including shyness.
And then there's the sex robotic woman Roxxxy Gold of True Companion, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah," which is distinguished by a shy nature and a "wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" nature.
“Roxxxy Gold is set to suit your personality to the maximum extent possible,” reads the website of True Companion.
She likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
It can be tired, talkative or “in the mood.”
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - which do not include the confusion for real interpersonal relationships. Rather disturbing are the inferior female character traits and violent innuendo - e.g., frigid (read-refusing) Farrah.
On its website, True Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t a man have Roxxxy?” the page reads.
However, sexual robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their origins and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deep-rooted in our culture - an expulsion from ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for captivating sex with an optional mark-up.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the edge of the general public's interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set by contemporary modern times.
And most people are not weird or violent until they get the excuse to do so free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are exercising their rights and the White House is occupied by a president who often speaks very derogatoryly to a woman’s address.
The most fearsome aspect of the series The Handmaid's Tale is not what we see - hanged bodies and hollowed out eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
The book's original The Handmaid's Story represents a step in the right direction, but it currently seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should resemble real women as much as possible (albeit with porn actresses).
Their creators construct them so that they are pleasant to the touch and act at first glance like a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality,” the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history. Nothing that would incite their independence or undermine their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The language of the 21st century: maids.
The NBA star on the green chive.
Curry's fighting for a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not get lost despite a botched first shot at his first start among professional golfers.
The two-time winner of the NBA's Most Valuable Player award played the first round at the Ellie Mae Classic of the lower Web.com Tour series in Hayward, California, and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously and his first tee ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even then, he was not as accurate among the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left behind a dozen professionals with a balance of four shots over par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, having to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it sat down a little bit," Curry said, adding that a huge fright had fallen on him.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I had to hope for.
"If you told me I was going to play 74 in the first round, I would take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight his way through the cut, which is likely to be two shots under par, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on the Web.com Tour.
“I want to play better next time and now that I’ve got rid of the fright, hopefully I can,” said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in the Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsorship exemption and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the epitome of common sense
The unmistakable sign of the Trump era is the political splits that divide American voters and, on a micro scale, break down entire families.
In the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, it was teeming with advice on how to deal with relatives who vote for Trump.
We're supposedly just waiting for their nerves to loosen.
Less attention, however, is paid to Trump's ability to bring the family together.
I'm talking about this because my cousin - a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has been in our family for a long time for a long time - visited me for a Republican fool.
She reminded me that tightness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly the whole family - including all the Republican siblings she's been bickering with about politics for years - is on one wavelength.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but I'm struck by the fact that, in the broader context, that poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrifying possibility that his clowns may one day lose out on attractiveness.
But there is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy dealings - a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - of which both examples look like very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it will be sufficient for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a tremendous improvement.
We took a visit to my cousin and took the kids to Central Park on the biggest merry-go-round run by the New York Department of Parks - you won't find a better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the center cylinder is covered with fiberglass - the clowns and animals are filmed and in horror they look at their own shoulders - a completely gloomy look, and the clinking music oddly resembles public transport.
Many clichés will soon get tired: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama will peek, instead of breathing the atmosphere on you, and the reality of the city is not getting your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really Swiss cheese - not counting the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but a London subway station.
The merry-go-round in Central Park, however, provokes a remarkably magical experience, to the point that two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, are having a great time with it.
If I could evaluate the merry-go-round, he deserves the maximum of points. Fortunately, no one asks.
This week I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to evaluate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying by credit card.
In a cafe on the corner of my street, it's the same, with the difference that I can throw in a 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is thus forced to intrude into the favor of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly rated my credit card transfer by five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to his wrist, which he said he had caused himself after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the original sentence for manslaughter.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of the morning of Valentine's Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of a toilet closet at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken her for a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, who, in their words, is too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court and the trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces an extension of his sentence to up to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a cub in captivity by a bred panda who was mating in the wild.
It is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of pands kept in captivity.
Zhang Zhzhong, a worker at the center, told the New China news agency that panda breeding was at great risk of kinship crossing.
There were only 471 pandas in captivity at the end of last year.
Only two thousand survive in the wild.
Trying to let the captured pandas mate with the wild ones is the first step to the breeding of pandas to help protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Chao-chao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda-mating period on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists could observe her every move.
She met her chosen one Cao-chao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the panda male lasted a minute and a half and turned out successfully.
This, too, can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
The males estimate the time when the female is ready, moreover, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during her pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians have been arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV as saying.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by the Sithonian police on August 1 in the early hours of the morning.
All were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone caught at a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will take place all season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilkova is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková is ranked 50th after the first round of the British Open.
The pitch at the Scottish Kingsbarns bypassed the score with one punch under par as she played three birdies and twice a bogey.
The twenty-two-year-old Czech player thus has the hope that she will go through the cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entering the competition with a $3.25 million endowment came out the best American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in a field record of 64 shots, that is, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are pulling millions of toxic eggs out of the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry farms because of the incident.
The Dutch food safety authority, according to Reuters, reported that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which he said means 80 percent of the eggs on the market are harmless.
The Authority stressed that only a limited number of egg types could be identified by specific numbers.
According to German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but the potential threat is for children.
Petr Majer, a spokesman for the Czech JRC, said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also approached the closure of farms, have not recently been imported to the Czech Republic.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, in whose markets the problem insecticide brands have emerged.
According to the veterinary administration, eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands last in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
There is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is a part of flea, everything and tick products.
However, it must not be served to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss him, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for an engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there someday," said the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like in school, it would be in three.
I didn't catch much the first year, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I've been studying.
The second year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie, with whom I took turns again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch all the time.
But during the opening ten games we probably only scored five points, so the coaches started to shoot it.
My colleague was catching more at the end.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's a small Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we'll get married next year.
So I brought something.
How challenging is the KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slavs, who have to change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play to the empty.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There is more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Have you been troubled by traveling and moving through seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep peacefully.
The program is usually done by playing four games outside and then having two days off.
How do Latvians feel about their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it's a national sport.
Everyone's rooting.
Even though it didn't work out, a lot of people walked.
Did Dinamo's work in the KHL help to the fact that Latvia almost advanced to the quarter-finals at this year's World Championships?
The KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time on, their results at the World Championships began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they have reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraleague.
Roberts Bukarts has made it to Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is ahead of the contract.
Why do so many come here?
They're not B players, they're really good.
The local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without engagement?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riga.
That way we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for the goalkeeper, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We had fun with different teams, but in the final we decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll be waiting for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about this?
That's what I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I take it another way.
The question is when and where I will sign.
How real is the possibility that you will start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where what happens.
Now I can only wait to see what the agent arranges.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season has not been such that I can choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's fling at Let continues.
In January this year, in the article With the care of a proper manager?, I wrote, among other things, about the camp in Lety u Orlíku.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to recall the pivotal passages of the article.
The camp in Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is, it is probably best if they look, for example, at the official website of the cultural monument Piení place Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical review, they learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from 8. 8. 1940 served as a labour camp, from 1. 1. 1942 was a collection camp and from 2. 8. 1942 became a Gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first air prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
Day 4. 5. 1943 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense hardships of human beings, caused by human beings and depraved ideology.
There is no doubt that these events must be constantly remembered.
There is no doubt that this commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 70's of the 20th century a pig farm was built on a part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy back and demolish the pig farm, but so far it has not.
In 1998 the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So much very briefly the facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It wasn't until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pig farm.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "some numbers exist, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went public with them."
We'll see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it's not going to be cheap.
And yet just a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a memorial, in whose modifications the state invested in 2010 almost ten million crowns.
Even if the UN Human Rights Committee financed the transaction beautifully, which is probably not a threat, I think it would be the same waste of money.
Does the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified memorial site, stands in the immediate vicinity of history in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy and anyone wants to, can bow to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and let's keep the memorial place with the utmost care.
The entrusted property, i.e. also the taxpayers’ money, should be treated with the care of a proper manager by the responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic.
At least with one like your own company!
Of course, the finance minister and deputy prime minister is not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above, I perceive the motto of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This May, I went straight to the place.
Very decent driveway, landscaped parking lot, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exhibition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of sitting and with a view of its own memorial site, which is created from stones located in a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as it suits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway on the site of the original camp.
It would be prudent to consider whether it would be possible, for example. conserve part of the uncovered foundations and make them at least visually available in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, Culture Minister Daniel Herman could put his efforts.
In the event that he manages to push through the purchase of a pig farm with state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic tenure as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300 000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to produce immune cells that promote gut resistance.
Head of study dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilt to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance in the stomach of mice with a particular bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to create cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have found a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of the bacteria L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher dr. As part of her study of a certain kind of body tolerance-promoting immune cells, Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice kept separately lacked cells.
She inferred that one group of mice has a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally dwell in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were tested by the DNA sorting method, and the researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lacked by the second group of mice.
Mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked an intestinal microbiome - so they didn't develop this kind of immune cells - were given the bacterium L. reuteri - and created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers have grown L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that have been kept in isolation.
Immune cells evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse's diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. At the same time, after splitting the dose of tryptophan, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if the by-products of tryptophan from the bacterium L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the genes related to tryptophan have been detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said: “Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammatoryness of the inner surface of the intestines.
The potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the cell population."
Jose Mourinho considers the signing of a contract with Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United to be 'genius'
Manchester United have acquired a "genius" in their team in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a contract for 40 million pounds, claimed in his first match with a 2:1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match ahead of the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereir.
However, since he did not participate in the team pre-season Asian tour, Matić did not have the form and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, needs to be worked on before the start of the next season of the Premier League.
"He needs time but he's experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mindset - he's thinking football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new team-mates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho is slowly starting to shape his eleven for next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign with three other players but insists the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players into the squad.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
“Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they did their best for me.”
The life challenge of the king of chicken cuticles Ládi Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promising picture began to loom thanks to a new show on TV Prima Zdeňka Academy.
The pear immediately smelled a chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy because, hand on heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on social media.
And since the two of them have been peaking for several years, Láďa did not forget to irritate him even this time.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo from diet chicken, American cucumber or invite you to the water and show you why fried cheese is your favorite," said Pear.
He's really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It is time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what about the boss," Lightning said.
Pohlreich, however, did not comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima responded to Pear's participation in the culinary academy, saying that he takes the whole affair as his personal activity, which goes off-TV.
The big blow was dealt to Pohlreich in December 2004 by his first cook.
Within a few days, it sold over 300 thousand pieces!
The new show, presented yesterday by Prima at a press conference on the autumn broadcast scheme, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve works.
In the last episode of his show Now the Boss Cooks in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed-out pear on the back of his T-shirt.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'm just smiling about the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Láďa responded.
He thinks of Láďa's culinary arts.
"Cooking according to Lád Hruška is not an option even at home, because I will not let home gastropunk," the boss said.
I appreciate Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, even according to him I make chicken for honey.
However, his recipes will definitely not appear in my show," Hruška did not forgive himself.
He's an asshole!
He's no cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiterate or asshole," Pohlreich said of Pear at a lecture.
"I'm not twenty to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them anymore," said Hruška.
A British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and house with a wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip injected into the body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has had a small chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and currently offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
The procedure of implantation and compliance with treatments are supervised by dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted with dogs and cats, and the entire procedure lasts 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a door and car lock replacement service, compatible with the microchip. The price of one castle is £300.
The married father of one child has integrated the technology into his house and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. manufacturing industry last month came to $24,000, according to Navy records released by the TIME weekly.
The green white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the 17 program. July at the White House, which was a showcase of U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials have looked at a product show from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a fork-shaped forklift from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and applied for the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the helicopter management unit - said.
"I wanted to make sure that you were aware of such a significant event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his supervisor, the deputy commander of the Navy for Aviation the day before the event began.
The report suggested that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn 17. July at approximately 7:00 a.m. on the occasion of the parade, the beginning of which is scheduled for 15:00 and will remain in place until the entire site is fully cleared, which was planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The email further stated that if there is a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be dispatched for the return flight due to the working hours regulations.
The original crew remained on the scene that evening along with the helicopter and along with them a unit of security personnel.
It was not apparent from the records - obtained by the weekly TIME - whether the second crew was eventually dispatched.
The Hatch Act prevents civil servants from using government property for political purposes.
The records suggest that HMX-1 is investigating a possible violation of this Regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was fine," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked," the deputy commander wrote back.
This “Made in America” show was designated an official event by the White House, and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political overtones.
In his participation in the event, the president advocated health reform, which passed through the Senate and spoke of an effort to keep government regulations at bay.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane was driving in the background at his first rally as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ showcase, which has introduced products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary.
The crews of the HMX-1 helicopter often train landings in the Washington and South Lawn areas, rehearsing any possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump participated in the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the crew's current training, a state official said.
The helicopter unit flew another eleven hours as part of the "non-presidential support missions" on the same day.
The White House said no other props had been paid for with taxpayers' money.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in any way in negotiations to issue a helicopter at South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights, and the exact cost in connection with the show is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017 is the DoD's expenses for VH-3D 24 $380 per flight hour.
The unit's records indicate a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below the stated amount.
"To state taxpayers' costs based on estimates for reimbursement of expenses is very misleading," Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual cost.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, compensation for DoD expenses does not include personnel costs, but include fuel price, maintenance and contractual costs.
The then White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, advocated the use of a helicopter for the purpose of the show.
"The idea of the show, which is taking place this week, is to introduce products produced in the U.S.," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state, and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military installations, in the production of which countless American citizens are involved.
This is to be remembered.”
It is unclear if Trump, during his rounds at South Lawn, was also looking at a helicopter. The only thing that can be said with certainty is that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump reached out to a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I own three of them myself."
A young woman was stranded in a swamp near Mácha's lake, police were wading to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around two o'clock in the morning.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask a cell phone for help from a police officer, she had the last 12 percent battery.
"For this reason, the officers soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols went to the place, which she approximately described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the policemen had to wade through the reed wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt the ground under their feet again," Baláková said.
And so was she missing.
The police were oriented according to which direction her call for help was based.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count down out loud," the spokeswoman said.
Police officers found the woman at three-quarters to five in the swamps in the Borný locality.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength, showing signs of hypothermia.
That's why the summoned ambulance took her to a Czech hospital.
The Grandpa's connection with STAN?
The desired bride becomes a selling girl.
That's a bit of irony.
With his web project lookdameslusny.cz, the billionaire basically tells voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
And he also confirmed that a politically disparate bunch of lesser-known mayors and independents, actually has no national agenda for the House elections.
Her election candidate simply becomes a decent person after an interview with Grandfather, whatever her political opinion.
Vít Bárta started this way once and it didn’t turn out very well.
With his hunt for decent people and personalities, who will eventually replace some mayors on the candidates, which Gazdík also admitted, in addition, Dědek cancels even the popular argument of the head of STAN that the biggest value of the movement is politically proven and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians even according to surveys.
They now calmly replace the hastily collected unknown personalities.
The total break-up with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if STAN was already suspected of identity by few, after the arrival of Grandfather, the mere play on identity also ends.
Not only Gazdík has long opposed the ANO of Andrej Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, said: "My goal is that the ANO movement, that is, the Mayors movement, will gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't mistake the movement.
Grandfather is a successful entrepreneur and the billionaire is certainly not by chance.
He often talks about politics similarly to Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been reminding for some time more of a reality show than a real political party, and Dědek's helping hand seems to make the desired bride even more of a selling girl.
For a while, STAN went with TOP 09, then with the people, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone calls in.
Police dogs trained in Most by helicopter overflight
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and search dogs were rehearsed helicopter overflights at Lake Most today.
The police dog must not be timid and afraid of flying, said Petr Tomášek, the head of the police cynologists of the Ústí Region.
The training of a police dog lasts about two years.
At Most, both adult trained dogs and those who were just going through the training practiced.
In addition to standard training, in which they were to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for the lost figurehead, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that immediately what the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work so that he does not have a problem with the helicopter journey.
"A helicopter lands, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tommy said.
A dog that is restless or unable to start working immediately along the helicopter journey is retired from training.
"Most of the time, the dog handlers keep them, for example, in the garden," Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with various specializations in the Ústí Region.
German shepherds prevail, but there are also increasing sheepdogs of Belgium.
The handler takes care of it from the puppy.
"He raises it himself, prepares it for a service that the dog will do for us," Tommy added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which can detect possible health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and inconspicuous, it passes the first exams in 20 months.
"He is getting into a sharp hit around two and a half to three years," Tommy added.
The length of the service with the police depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dog handlers.
The trailer for Season 3 of Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel is the centerpiece of Netflix's hit series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when the killer of Pablo Escobar is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons of the streaming service have already been confirmed - the first-named has already received the first trailer and an outline of other negative characters.
In the third season, the DEA focuses on the world's richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of the four influential godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company," with the only difference being that they are escalating acts of violence and bribed more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will make its debut on September 1.
According to the United Nations, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The election can only be credible if all members of society, including women, attend, a U.N. representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, a senior U.N. Auxiliary Mission official, said hundreds of women are participating in local council elections, three women are running for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate in them, as well as all related processes related to the election.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on April 5.
The Taliban have made several threats against the electoral process that are moving international combat activity to the other track.
In this year's elections, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government hands over its power to the next government peacefully.
Haysom said the strong role of women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission said that of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The unique brewery brews beer again.
For a good beer in the resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned to life a few years ago the brewery in Lobč u Mšena.
The brewery, first commemorated in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was rebuilt into a steam-trained operation in the 19th century.
It was followed by years of prosperity, when the brewery was famous mainly for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, during the Second World War, production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state farm.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building material.
In 2007, however, a new hope shone in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouz.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have carefully devoted themselves and are dedicated to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same form as in the 19th century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded by the brewery’s declaration as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015 they also renewed the tradition of brewing beer.
If you want to taste great Lobeč beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínsko, visit the bar in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use Kokořín water springing in a protected landscape area, malt from the Lobeč fields and Žatec hops.
In the bar you will taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And do not miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at half past two.
The largest artillery fortress of Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its type on a global scale?
Such a unique building was to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, on the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
It was originally intended to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by a large underground.
There was supposed to be a headquarters, a barracks, ammunition depots, material, a power plant, an engine room and a hospital.
The Munich Agreement ended the construction.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also visit here.
The underground is already 75 percent open!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with exhibition and underground, the complex includes an armed light fortifications building, two built-up infantry cabins, trenches and an educational trail Fortified Trutnov.
Refreshments, a cosy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has made it onto the list alongside monuments such as the Great Wall of China, Traian's Port of Rome or the Assyrian Palaces of Nineveh and Nimrud.
The monastery of Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged building of the convent above the beautiful garden.
The list he has made but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are at risk of extinction.
However, enthusiasts do not want to give up and organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is another year of the Evening for the Chotěšov monastery this Saturday, August 5th, where it will perform, among others. Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Hlas, you will see swordsmanship performances and you will look at the places of beautiful large buildings that are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free application Pl@ntNet will help students with the creation of herbari and ordinary plant lovers.
When they wonder what kind of plant they just came across on a walk, this app will advise them.
All they will have to do is photograph the plant, and the application itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for both iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Center for Ethics and Environmental Education in Bratislava’s Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who with teachers photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the application database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Even children who keep a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go out into the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, the coordinator of the project.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name in a few seconds, which it then assigns in Czech and Slovak under the photo.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech in the project The Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database after creating an account for the application.
"The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková said.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The unions are demanding assurances from managers of biscuit maker McVitie's about a long-term commitment to production at a factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company was silent for the time being about a possible investment in a Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, the Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it had invested more than 5 million pounds in the entire area as part of several previous years.
She added that employees and union representatives will be "among the first informed" in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the company's construction manager, Scottish GMB unions expressed their concerns that McVitie's "will not deliver on its promises to finance and modernise production lines."
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received a clear response from the construction manager regarding the company's needs and future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Many families have worked here, and employees mostly come from the local community and Glasgow, where work in the factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area from high unemployment and social separation.
From a job, salary and benefit perspective - and despite the outlook for Brexit, rising living costs and falling slow production - Glasgow's eastern part needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The Tollcross builder received a letter from the GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as we value the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives at Tollcross was held two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We spoke to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area, in particular in production lines and streamlining operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the locality here, and in case of any changes in the operation of the local factory, the employees and representatives of the unions will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to take his side after having lodged £189 million, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from his contract, but warned this French team Barcelona about their record-breaking raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer stirred up the waters of summer transfers. The Ligue 1 club is poised to surpass more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogba's transfer to Manchester United, who paid £89 million for him last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, he will receive more than £500 000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona are outraged by the way Neymar has pulled himself out of his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world brought to the attention of the president of PSG three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club that would be interested in taking over one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not afraid because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will definitely reach out to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences.”
Barcelona appear to have crossed the notional line when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG have made it clear that under no circumstances will they allow the Italian representative to leave. It is therefore possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for its presumptuous negotiations with Neymar's departure.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump has nodded to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it would not go on.
It also makes the idea of sanctions like a straw from shoes.
You can't throw those things in one bag.
Maduro's Venezuela really set off on the road to dictatorship, indeed totalitarianism.
China is not just behaving the way the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter unto itself.
But if someone wanted to summarize all this in such a way that even the ordinary voter, American, European or otherwise, understood what he was in and what system of rules the policy of sanctions was based on, it would be a task almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely tightening up what President Obama has already prepared, only giving it an implementing stamp.
So why such a stir?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the US election, he would embrace Putin and remove sanctions.
A terrible idea.
In practice, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not being released, but they are tightening.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German Secretary Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Like kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian sanctions of the EU.
European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump’s sanctions threaten EU energy security.
Is it that sanctions should be used only so weak that they do not endanger anyone?
Ordinary voters are groping.
For three years he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the fulfilment of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now known that it is about the EU's energy security.
The voter is also more broad.
There are sanctions on Russia for being too much of a place where it is not supposed to.
China is slim for having little to assemble.
Venezuela's president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their own rationality.
But does anyone see it as a system, order or rules?
Andrej Babiš: I am not considering cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš got married, crisscrossing the republic with his visionary book and finalizing the electoral program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, he already has all the candidates ready.
In his words, he did not significantly interfere with them.
He even agreed to be headed by the Governor and Shadow Minister of Education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member or a governor," Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You have upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and towns themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
That wasn't the case.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we are directly electing a president, and I am convinced that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about the cancellation of councillors, they might as well be there.
The question is how many there will be.
When I presented your book What I Dream About When I Accidentally Sleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about abolishing councils.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct election and reduction of the number of representatives.
New York City, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 councillors.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is reproached for not building enough and not preparing big projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of the government, which in our history has been run by only two people, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it right.
But the current prime minister is not running anything, he is just hosting the debate.
That's not how it works.
That's why you want to enforce the majority system?
He'd be ideal, but it's hard to make it.
In the program, we just have a change to a one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate of ministers and an amendment to the Rules of Procedure of the House to avoid unnecessary exhibitions of MPs who are supposed to work mainly in commissions and committees, not to be presented at meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that’s exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the House with 101 MPs, abolish the counties and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors, you will control the whole country.
It certainly isn't that.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of MPs.
French President Macron announced a reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57 thousand French people per legislator, while in our country it is 17 thousand Czechs.
No one blames Macron for endangering democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic wins the election by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
But the seductions for those who have a parliamentary majority are great, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the case of the Yes movement.
We just need a team that will work in government for the people, not for our parties or resorts.
I don't understand, for example, why we couldn't agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services would increase.
Why did they override me and add 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60 grand?
Would you, as prime minister, step on that?
The prime minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave inefficiently, confuse the government with a travel agency and, with the money of the state, would like to do business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in government, contradictions are supposed to be resolved outside of it.
The finished material must go to the cabinet, there is no room for coalition rifts, force votes and deals, there is to be a decision.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers behave mainly partisanly?
There is a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said the coalition treaty did not apply, and kicked Babiš out of the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has control skills, such false gestures do not need.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would propose to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, we probably won't be in that government, no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
So much skepticism is not appropriate.
The mayors got the entrepreneur Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you, in the people's people may win the wing of your inclined Jiří Čunek.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not exclude the coalition with ANO, in the ODS perhaps Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not oppose it.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many common points with the SPD Tomio Okamura, for example in the field of the economy.
So the Okamurovs come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of Vít Bárta for VV, then he got money from Dawn for his company, there was a coup.
He is, of course, a distinctive personality.
But somewhat brownish.
When I take his agenda, he has a wide range of people's involvement in corporate governance, direct democracy, that's a good thing to agree with.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if it is acceptable for you to have xenophobic opinions, speak at demonstrations with gallows and want to leave the EU?
We're not considering working with Mr. Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
Clearly, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can't imagine that either, but the voters will decide.
It's going to be about negotiating the winner with the second in the standings, but God knows who's going to be the winner and who's two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on the coalition government's agenda.
Let's go back to your quest to run the state like a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, he never decided.
Coalition affairs like ČEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was the reason why he fired me.
Once he did, ČEZ took over the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the management of ČEZ, which obliges the Minister of Finance to vote at the general meeting of ČEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the personnel situation in the Supervisory Board and replace the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus, if I'm Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not one yet.
It is rumored that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with ČSSD for even better with YES.
Maybe after the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have a lobbyist Pokorný or Růžička, I'm a separate unit and I don't deal with this at all.
So answer directly.
If you are the head of the government, will you seek to replace the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions you criticize?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
It is enough to find out Mr. Schwarzenberg's remarks.
Although the state has a majority in ČEZ, it never drove it, it was only there in number, which is wrong.
It's a trivial thing for me.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supplier competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear unit.
The concept that the state is supposed to finance and build new nuclear units is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purposeful campaign against me, but I don't have and I won't have any competence to fire anyone.
But to control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay fees for public radio and television of about 7.2 billion a year, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How come they don't know?
After all, the Chamber of Deputies approves the report on their management, which has a direct influence on the positions of the CEOs of ČT and ČRo.
Look how the reports are discussed, for the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from the investigative files and to lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push him to throw me out of the government, which passed a percentage of TOP 09, but the ČSSD took them away.
They are afraid of disrupting their corruption system, so they talk about the threat of democracy by Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-chairman of ANO, Jaroslav Faltýnek, builds a power background by putting his son on the Supervisory Board of the Brno Heating Plants and arranging contracts with the Prague Transport Company or Czech Railways for his related lawyer Květoslav Hlín?
We have a permanent dispute in that.
I don't like it, and I've blamed him a few times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer works at substantially lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't proceed that way.
As finance minister, I had no one.
Unlike the Socans, we have never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvílová, Březina.
If there was any indication of clientelism in our country, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happens, we'll get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
