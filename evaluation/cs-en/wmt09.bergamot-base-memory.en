The Prague Stock Exchange fell to the minuse at the end of trading
After a sharp slump in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange has continued its slump since the beginning of Tuesday's trading session, falling by nearly six percent.
This time, the decline is due to a slump in Wall Street stock.
In our country, too, the market’s response to the outcome of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for stabilizing the financial sector.
The Fall of Equities in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday was experienced by stocks on stock exchanges in Asia, although indices eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng index wrote off nearly four percent during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai, the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five per cent but eventually cut losses to 4.3 per cent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell 3.6 percent, according to the index.
"The timing of the rescue operation in the U.S. is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary policy office.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines monetary policy independently, without depending on China’s central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should urgently return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
Otherwise, other countries are at risk of feeling the impact.
Blood bath of U.S. stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 trillion CZK) were to be spent.
Lawmakers have thus ignored President George W. Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indexes recorded the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent, and the slump in the similar range was last recorded in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the bill had not passed in the House, the index found itself in free fall.
Congress backs down: U.S. government can pump $700bn into banks
Top U.S. Congressional leaders and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of a financial assistance agreement for the U.S. financial system.
There will be a vote on it early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks on approving a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the U.S. financial system of 700 billion dollars (around 12 trillion crowns).
However, it has not yet been won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final form of the law.
The financial system's support plan will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
In the Senate, according to sources, the plan could be voted on probably not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that a rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, there will then be a "sobering up" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms by which to help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences of opinion on what the form of the market stabilization package should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers' representatives met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson last night to give a definitive form to the government's fund.
It should buy back from financial companies unsaleable mortgage assets that drag financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the brink of a definitive agreement of a plan that will work and be effective in the market as well.
We still need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is hitting stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where congressional decisions could affect Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether they can be stuck to a last-minute hearing on a problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars is to be available as soon as possible, as President George W. Bush has demanded.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, in the sequence of another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush praises progress in negotiations
The president may veto this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of a program that was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities, the value of which has plummeted because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, has remained.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Sen. Judd Gregg said in a statement.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress in negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restrictions on golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, a senior negotiator, said lawmakers agreed on responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, making concessions, timing funding the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of corporate participants in the program and establishes a committee to have oversight over the fund.
It should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said in a statement.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who have trouble repaying.
The government should negotiate new repayments on the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of repayments for borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to David Mark, chief economist at Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because it's not known what mechanism and at what cost the troubled assets will be redeemed.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will share their losses," Marek told news server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not so important, according to Mark.
“It is much more important that the congressmen agree this week that they support the plan and that they will sanctify it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, combined, has 29 percent
The significant weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties have brought, according to the first preliminary results, Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly strong losses, where the position of the current chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaking.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Corutan Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country remains the social democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the last election in 2006.
The ÖVP, which loses almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent, was even worse.
These are the worst results of both of these big parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially for the people who triggered the early elections, literally a disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the people's people had a significant lead over the SPÖ in their preferences.
But voters apparently punished them for letting the government crash.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party chairman and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday at an emergency meeting of the party's bureau.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. the restoration of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and the ÖVP.
However, due to the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) gained preliminary 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - the Social Democrats also expressed fears of a repeat of 1999, when the people agreed with populists (at that time the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 split from BZÖ) to a joint government, which even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
Haider is clearly betting on these developments, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with either party and foresees a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also made it to parliament, but it lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the four percent threshold and did not make it to parliament.
Knife blade fight: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We will advise you on how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
From this, it seems clear that it is better to buy just a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons for a person to buy a separate player.
The choice completely depends on the method of use and the demands of the future owner.
I think it's hard to get a top-of-the-line expensive turntable to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products are not available on LP records, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues are crowded in your shelves, you will probably dream of such a turntable at least.
It is the same with music on the road, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on the player, just like a Pink Floyd fan, it is probably difficult to bite the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines battery life
Some high-end music players can handle much more than just playing music, but what most mobiles can do.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to primary features, phone calls and seedings, can play music and video, record both, have a better, worse camera and maybe even navigate.
And taking into account smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, no refrigerator can grill, and no TV can photograph anything.
The versatility of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobiles can play music for more than ten twelve hours, usually it's much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobile phones, therefore, expect that they will not play for more than a few hours.
If you still call it here and there, get another charger for sure for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
You won’t have this problem with MP3 players, even the worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when recording music to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and in addition, not every one of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers can handle miniature memory cards that are used in mobiles without reduction.
With exceptions (iPod) you do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create a music library sorted by the name of the artist, album name, genre or user rating.
Some devices display only the tree structure of directories similar to Explorer in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, be especially interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of control.
If the music is primarily a backdrop and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you only need any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Almost any mobile phone can do that.
You don’t even have to watch what music formats your mobile or player can do.
MP3s can handle all, and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and, in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can handle music in WMA format.
Less is the AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online.
Just visit the respective website of the operator (or other provider) and purchase a song or album via the mobile internet.
This service could already be a compelling argument for acquiring a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and is limited to fast-feeding radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this method of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) dominates the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones with them.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you feel your phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wire handsfree with you.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music mobile phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent walkman.
However, you will usually be limited by the absence of output to regular headphones.
The best and, technically, the most equipped phones with a 3.5 mm socket for conventional headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - the players can be controlled by everyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of control with a previously common tape recorder or turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mistakenly switched on mobile internet and subsequently a huge account for data transmission.
What device to reach for
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually has a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card, you can fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
By capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, you better reach for specialized mobiles - walkmen (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the operator comfort is thus close to a separate MP3 player.
The furthest is in the Sony Ericsson industry, whose mobiles from the walkman series have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price range up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take you MP3 players from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classics cheaper.
He might not miss long.
We have written about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
After all, this was confirmed by the CTU, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are held so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to fight.
It may sound paradoxical, after all, we have three mobile networks and penetration high over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to play on the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (CTU), Pavel Dvořák, has often said that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with its own network probably does not have much chance (after all, it would probably be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, which were then also to be responded to by classic operators.
Even before the entry of pikes such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, similar voices were heard in the UK as in the Czech Republic.
However, it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We don’t have to go too far for example.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, the operator managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
At the same time, the financial group Penta, which owns U:fona in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they need much fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheaply as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a fresh target group can also be a good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"The right guys are choosing Mobilking - an operator they like and who they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, running this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be caught in our country.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone’s spokesperson, doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
Rather, on the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor arises.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been the GTS Novera group for a long time, so it would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor to Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already managed to advance the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the group's press secretary.
Maybe it's flashing for better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be waiting maybe by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific than other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň from the Telefónika O2 press department said in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators are also appealing to the specificity of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson for T-Mobile, adds in rare agreement with O2: "We have not yet seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further."
He adds: "It's hard to have a virtual operator on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table to consider in this short term.”
Vodafone is focusing its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepicický says: "By dealing with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost-sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus a decline in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when the operators are interested in something, they can pull together, also testifies to the tug-of-war around the formation of U:fon.
Probably the greatest pressure towards CTU went at the time of the creation of U:fon from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly accessible information from the CTU website.
But now it is U:fon that is suitable as an argument for not admitting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently enhanced by the entry of a fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and especially on his services."
However, due to this approach of mobile operators, the complete lack of interest of Czech regulators is striking.
It is not just the attitude of the CTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
However, he took his typical attitude towards the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after a contract was concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual operator to lease the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential candidates was probably not interesting enough for classic operators," Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the Office said in response to our question.
It will probably not surprise the representatives of the operators of the statement.
From an authority that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, make sure that no one abuses their position on the market, it is more than considered.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the reduction of prices for mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices is not among the interests of the Office.
In fact, shocking about the whole case is the touching harmony of the three mobile operators that result from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is entirely offered by itself.
Like the exact same price of petrol at gas stations, it is certainly only a work of chance and a tough competitive struggle.
"The Office has not found any signs of anti-competitive conduct in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore it does not have adequately responsible for its conduct on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are probably missing even for the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
Interpreting the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by the CTU, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of competition.
Of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment, it necessarily has to be dominant.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning for the Office that three mobile operators proceed strikingly similarly.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The murmuning of responsibility at CTU is then a relatively usual trick in telecommunications, which the Office puts its hands away from the whole matter.
We have already encountered him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act did not push for the extension of the CTU’s powers to competition in telecommunications, although many experts have promised to improve the situation.
This must be known more than well by the representatives of the Office, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It goes when no one is watching
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies issuing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, which are only partially public.
These are usually multilevel marketing companies.
Its own mobile telephone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, he will receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar resale.
"If there are cases you are talking about, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová said in response to our question about the issue.
However, it is unlikely that such activity will be brought to the responsible people of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, there can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators oppose such a procedure.
They have considerable profits from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual operators, do not endanger them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not kept in their name, so they cannot have it fully with it as ordinary customers of mobile operators."
This should be at least strange for CTU.
In addition, another question for the Office opens up.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the Office has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to settle for the explanation of the operators that they have no idea about such a thing and their terms and conditions prohibit it.
When won't we be the most expensive
As has already been done several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at these moments that regulators intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and another was packed on it.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are tossing the whole case around like a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot shake the impression that the lack of competence suits them more than in these cases.
But let's not throw the flint into the rye.
If behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will really soon appear in our country, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If one of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the Office to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling more expensively than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four versions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented new recordings of the national anthem Where My Home on the occasion of the Czech Statehood Day.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral submission and instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka performed singing.
The authors of the hymn modifications are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the server iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymens.
He previously told Czech Radio that he deliberately selected singers with young representative voices for singing solo variants, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that they had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they would agree," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where My Home was first performed in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
She gained popularity and people spontaneously took her as their own.
The first stanza of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the “new” anthem
Prague public transport on Wednesday will also ride a chip for the first time
Wednesday 1. October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket will board the metro, trams and buses.
At this time, it can buy about a hundred thousand people who own an Opencard smart card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have their chip card uploaded to their smart card in the information centers and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service by the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the dispensing windows in the metro stations, where they have until now had to stand regularly in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon over the Internet and upload it to the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"There is a counter with trained service available to passengers at these places, which will help those interested with the online purchase and also upload the purchased coupon to their card," said Martin Opatrný, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service machines, which are mounted in several metro lobbys.
What do slot machines look like?
They are red, resemble ticket markers and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. p. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five of them in the city, but there should be eighty by the end of the year," Opatrný added.
The coupon will check the driver's seat automaton
The operation of the vending machines, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just insert the Opencard smart card into them and the previously paid coupon will upload to it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow apply not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, through which mainly residents of Central Bohemian municipalities travel to the capital.
"On trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the conductors are equipped with card readers, through which they detect the time and band validity of the coupons," explained ticket control Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which compiles the timetables of Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's ticket office.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If passengers need to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and do not remember when the coupon expires can go again to the self-service vending machines where the vouchers are recorded on the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudetenland wanted a referendum on the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the inclusion of the Bohemian Forest in the United States.
This is from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Research Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
This is the result of, among other things, a letter that has been preserved in one private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Research Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov ask the American president in a letter not to allow the return of the "Shumava county" - seized by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we want to be really sure that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," reads the letter, signed with the words "The people who care about the fate of the Bohemian Forest."
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia supposedly gives the Sudeten Germans - with knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American president beg the authors of the letter of the American president to take over the Protectorate for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would admit this territory to a foreign country to us that oppresses and disproves minorities and nothing, it has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly the fear of the vindictiveness of "Czech oppressors."
If the president of the United States allegedly doubts the minds of the Šumava Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Šumava county on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the U.S. or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naïve in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses, it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that it would be their removal from the Republic, few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetens.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
During the war he was a German deployed to the navy in the Baltic.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would need Czech," said Chalupa.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia anticipated that he would be removed from the republic on the basis of Beneš’s decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, an emotional media campaign that the Department of Transportation intends to launch on Wednesday could be characterized.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to deter the driver from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also to remind them to be chained before they leave.
He wants to reach into his conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's evidenced by the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "you don't think" is written in capital letters on the espézetka.
And in a pool of blood, the word "you pay."
This is to symbolize that one can pay in a moment of inattention with one's own life.
Viewers will be "scared" by the spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of accident victims can be seen routinely.
It promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"The driver's sugar and whip system applies.
The sugar for them is that when they go red, for example, it saves time.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says Na Homolce hospital traffic psychologist Martin Kořán.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and especially negative ads are needed, the psychologist says.
The boards that alert the driver to the danger are already less effective.
"If a static board is installed warning of danger, it will probably soon merge with the surroundings and drivers will not attend to it," Kořán pointed out.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has spoken out in favour of the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all of them," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the territory of Israel) because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that East Jerusalem would include a possible return.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places" that lie within the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
That won't work," he further pointed out.
Leaving the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out in favour of Israel leaving the Golan Heights, which he said was an inherent condition for concluding a peace deal with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria alone on the basis of leaving the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shiite movement) of Hezbollah; they will have to give up the lasting support provided by the terrorism (Shiite movement) of Hamas, the (terrorist network) of Al-Qaida and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq.”
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused of illegally collecting bugs in India could not be solved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherji.
"If it had not been resolved, then yes, then there would have been a certain cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said after the hearing that executive power could find it difficult to interfere in court matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Darjiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls in.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, according to Mukherji, it would be best for him to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for his release on bail and wait for the verdict at large, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed himself in the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can enter the matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the condemned, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said, such assistance is already provided by the Indian side.
“We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as ČTK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake of imprisonment and indictment of these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises," he said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose whether stewards and passengers could move around the bus while driving.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is in violation of the Road Traffic Act," says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck who crossed the road of the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she still has two other seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the technical card.
If it is not approved on the bus, passengers must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have places for parking; which Aktuálně.cz was confirmed by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"We discussed this with the Ministry and did not allow the movement of passengers at first.
They later called it off and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he said.
The law does not know the steward
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation even prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the conductor of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," Hanzelka's spokesperson adds less clearly.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, the director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport, said that the law adequately addresses the issue.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed to stand in the homologation.
That's the end of it," he says.
The buses are divided into urban, where there are places for parking and limited maximum speed, intercity with parking places with higher speeds and remote parking spaces with the highest speed limit and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says expert
BESIP expert on transport safety Jaroslav Hořín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"There is not much danger in a smooth ride, the situation can be compared to servicing on airplanes.
Nor is it certain when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant can hit her head.'
"But if the bus brakes sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be addressed by carriers by internal regulations," he says, and also means that from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the services
The Student Agency offers steward services as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But once I get the impression that the profession of stewards is risky, I will abolish them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers on boarding.
It would also save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stewards in his cars was justified by the director of Asian Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been up against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end in some kind of fatal accident," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
An immense tragedy has happened
A young stewardess from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, was killed in a line connection accident to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out without using a signpost from the shutdown lane and blocked the bus's path.
His driver tried to avoid the violent manoeuvre, but he hit the right front.
That two places reserved for the rest of the stewards would be sold out, Jančura refuses.
"These places cannot be booked for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's ortel, but he expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Amendment of the law?
In sight
A refinement of the movement of stewards aboard the bus could bring an amendment to the law, which has been being worked on by the Ministry of Transport's thirty-member expert group for over a year.
"There was no concrete conclusion.
The buses do not even solve much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes, adding that the control of the safety of buses is within the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Czech judges fight over seabed
It will proceed to the wall electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team of UN Department of Ocean and Law Affairs.
His boss, the director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors the interpretation and occasionally completes it.
There's work spirit and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a still little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, but also previously unknown living organisms that carry the key to the development of a cure for cancer.
A bottom bigger than the mainland
Today, coastal states have started to vehemently bid for new underwater territories.
Under the UN Convention, they use their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, it has the exclusive right to all resources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its bedrock, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It reaches beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country to the Commission for the demarcation of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technological documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide legal and professional technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the latter countries have succeeded so far," adds Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia, which has been the first to substantially expand its underwater possessions, has recently seen a world acclaim.
But it also gained New Zealand - the area of the seabed, which the commission admitted to it last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
The two countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profits that will flow from the use of the seabed in the future will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other countries will submit their applications gradually.
They can do so until ten years after ratifying the "Convention of Montego Bay."
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor begins, by a convention declared a "common heritage of humanity."
There is no state here that has an exclusive position.
The right of mining in this field is granted by a convention established by an international institution.
"The seabed is not a Klondajk," says Director Mikulka, adding that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contracted."
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, according to the convention, as well as investors of a few other states, it gained the status of a so-called "pioneering investor."
It is authorized to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and the Kiribati.
The investor-spoken area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is rugged, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It can be mined on an area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetalic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," states another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings one such concretion to the demonstration.
It resembles a small potato or, with a little imagination, a fabled shem that, according to legend, brought to life the Golem.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
There are big words in the WestLB Board of Directors' letter to the bank's employees.
By combining the units of this Düsseldorf money institution with Frankfurt's Deka-Bank, "the central institution of the financial group of savings banks for trade on capital markets," we will read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring a "set of competences" to this transaction, ensuring long-term revenues.
And in general, such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further association in the sector of land banks.
Such texts arise when the Board of Directors wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose message from the provincial government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which customers of the savings banks know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever the kind, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, said that he did not see the mergery of his bank house from Mainzer Landstraße with any of the country’s banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, in the merger.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is backed by one half of the Landesbank and from the other by the Association of Savings Banks, has instructed the Board of Directors to conduct talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be about dealings in the capital market or part of them.
But the talks have only just begun, the financiers note.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not being talked about for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked for a while that Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and with the Helaba bank.
In the end, nothing came of this tri-association.
Shortly after the merger's plans went public, the Hesse's provincial government spoke out against the Bank's participation.
Neither of the remaining bank houses came together that way.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Despite this, there has been repeated speculation about the connection between Deka-Bank and the Land banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the board of directors of the Helaba bank, has commented negatively on speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
However, it seems that, independently, the belief that the rapprochement of the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity is a matter.
Now, after the elections to the regional parliament in Bavaria, the first to start the connection between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could begin to loom.
That's not exactly good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers were to increase, it would gradually lose possible partners for such a connection.
In the south, she would play only a second violin despite the fact that the financial crisis so far faces significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In the beginning of the year, the Association of Savings Banks and the Gire banks Hessen-Thüringen, which has an eighty-five percent stake in Helaba, banned the connection with WestLB.
This would be considered at most by Nord LB.
However, geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how much the business models of individual institutions match.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks, the German Association of Savings Banks and Gire Banks has not yet answered.
It could also all end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That is why the letter of the local board of directors also talks about trying to "comprehensive solution" for the whole bank house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect with the connection of individual components with Deka-Bank will tell time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with the Italians"
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca for the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena will be there as his girlfriend, and so everything will be different, she says.
Behind them, at the five-litre barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists at Oktoberfest proves how deep the tones can be given by his throat.
Elena slaps Lucu first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus car park next to Puorta Nuova Station, four buses marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" will depart this evening at 23.45.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, on one bus there are exclusively Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And this loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for the Italians.
Marc, who is wearing a long coat with a lining of fur and glasses with wide silver frames, the three buses belong.
He has been riding with them on Oktoberfest for five years, only this year he is organizing three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stands, at 22.30 departure back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, brewed exactly according to the Bavarian law on the purity of beer, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco went on a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave into the night, along the car road towards "Brennero."
The beer is not served, not yet.
The bus quickly shuts up, the passengers sleep.
They're doing well, they're still going to need their strength.
It stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many other buses with an Italian license plate take place on motorway 8 just outside Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has his last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: Put on a yellow hat.
On it, the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiagiaggiando.it".
Second, "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" Marco calls out into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, so that you do not get in the way, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, place yourself in space!"
The maze costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that we're behaving.
Once you leave your seats, they are gone!”
Third: "Be here again at half past eleven tonight!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps as signs on trees, signs and even on an election poster of one of the big Bavarian parties.
It is necessary to prepare for the retreat.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "weekend with the Italians."
Exact data on the number of visitors is not available; fifty thousand of those who travel through the Alps and fall into beer tents are said to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The ranks of the Munich police will be strengthened by seven police officers from South Tyrol, while Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which is conducting a national statistic in which Italians before the British (about 60 hits) and Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments fill the first place.
The Hofbräu tent is especially popular with Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
Good thing this politician used the word "relatively" and also confused the fact that the German banking sector will not remain spared from crisis development.
Because it came last weekend.
The Dax index-tracked financial house specializing in the financing of real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan of several billion from the consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance would go up to 35 billion euros.
Interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the amount actually spent.
The money comes from private and public banks.
In the background are losses of a subsidiary of Depfa.
According to the newspaper report, this state financier refinanced extremely short-term projects for which he lent money, which is now no longer possible due to market distrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve shriveled by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity share fell slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current returns and net returns on financial trades fell to zero compared to last year, revenues from the increased value of receivables and from certain securities, and also from the cancellation of reserves for credit trading fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher returns on compensation for subsequent clearing costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and on the interest compensation under the Tax Code and for brokering trade for group undertakings was the sixteen percent decline on the revenue side still moderate.
The former state financier burned himself on mortgages for sole traders after his privatization in 1990, which was then separated from the portfolio of services and further maintained by Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little money in classical state funding, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write something off, and these write-downs will have a "fundamental material effect" on calculating the profits and losses of the entire group, as some have been vaguely heard.
The fact is, there will be no dividend.
It was already cut by two-thirds for 2007.
Since the takeover of Depf, Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects.
Stronger than other institutes depends on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, the source of interbank loans virtually dried up two weeks ago because banks are guarding liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds per year for part of the Depfa loan portfolio - about 50 billion euros.
According to the statement Hypo Real Estate, the financial need of the group is covered by this loan for the foreseeable period and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets at the moment to a large extent incapable of function".
Other sources have said that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets anytime soon.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now assured.
This is what the bank's shareholders and creditors hope for.
But given the momentum and intangibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan would not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank appeared to be facing insolvency late on Sunday afternoon, the rescue cannot, although preliminary, calm the passions.
The exchange rate of the shares fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, the bond courses were well held.
While the preferred debts have practically not moved, they are losing the rates of secondary bonds more significantly.
This applies mainly to the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically bonds with a maturity period after 2009.
The bonds of Hypo-Real-Estate originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability must be understood, depending on the stability of the international financial system, after a significant sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself that brought it to the company by taking over Depf.
As long as issuance banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their maturity period.
But there may also be what almost no one dares to hope for now - a financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become a mere legitimate hope.
This, especially for long-term creditors, is likely to be prepared for a number of sleepless nights, when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the boundary line at least to create a transfer of loss from previous financial years to exchange revenues of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
German special deployment units were in the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in dealing with the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, the special forces were ready, but the deployment did not take place.
Other details of the circumstances of the liberation of eleven kidnapped European tourists in Egypt are gradually coming to the public.
German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue, according to the data of the Ministry of Defence and Interior.
According to the statement of the ministries, both the experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, squadrons of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and also experts in logistics from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the site of the liberation.
However, according to another statement from the spokespersons of both ministries from Monday afternoon, there was no need for German forces, because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized the signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the assistance offered by Germany as a support force for the on-site action.
"Luckily, that didn't happen," said one spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and also eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, they moved hostages in border territories between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as did the details of the exemption or possible payment of the ransom.
They are now well-saved in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
There is no information in Berlin yet when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, all five tourists should, even with special forces, fly one of the German Air Force's Airbuses and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is supposed to introduce herself on her first day at high school in Tachibana, the girls start to giggle: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from mangoes. On his new blog about an exchange, he talks about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already out of the way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train to high school in Tachibana.
I had to find the way myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tačibana is not given as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after eight o'clock, and twenty minutes before nine, a short session begins with a teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But before the classes started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, let alone 40 students in front of a class.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I wore the old skirt of my host mom, plus a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sajónara Wo sey Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangoes.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my seat.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, considering it an honor that a foreign student was supposed to be sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was fairly calm, but when the gong sounded, they literally filled me.
They spoke over each other and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - and yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, everyone unpacked their benta.
My host mom also made me such a lunch box - and that's different than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of fish in tofu batter.
I usually have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except for the salt-loaded plums, br!
Benta at Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a hand-prepared bento, which in this case is especially artistically adapted, and hopes to get to know the boy during a snack during the break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo school for a year.
I always said,
'Because I'm just fascinated.'
I’ve loved reading mangoes for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started learning Japanese a little bit.
It was clear to me that I would have to come here someday.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And those are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen.'
U.S. House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress let the 700 billion dollar bailout package fall by a narrow majority.
The Dow Jones index fell strongly.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's financial market bailout package.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties have not found a majority for a program that should ease the chaos in financial markets.
The proponents were desperately trying to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called on MPs to vote in agreement before the vote, although, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he acknowledged.
The Dow Jones fell more than six percent, or 600 points, during the vote.
The reason was investor fears that the state rescue package could fall through.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose to fall steeply again after the announcement of the failure of the package.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into force, the consent of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach flees danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Joseph LeDoux, a neurologist, is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify whether they feel the same thing when they behave similarly to us?
Posts from well-known scientists have been published in the online journal "Edge" for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without being able to prove it, or anyone else, when we cannot prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we start to focus on a different kind and open up questions of perception or universal consciousness, we enter into impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets into danger, it will do the same thing that many other animals do: it will pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
People behave similarly, of which some scientists conclude on a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal experience.
This is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its share of short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This extensive region is significantly more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to assume that one is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be hidden by the linguistic nature of a person: because such a large part of his perception is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if consciousness did not matter to the language, it would certainly influence the language, so that animal consciousness, however constructed it may be, would probably differ from most states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, it puts us in great trouble to explore it.
Most of my inferences relate to the content of conscious experience, but in addition, there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically more easily accessible.
It would be possible to examine the processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, which was addressed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on the neural correlats of consciousness rather than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I infer them from the fact that an emotional system like a system of fear is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is thus the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of a defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) uses the operating memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely intertwined with those areas of the cortex that characterize primates, and especially people.
In connection with linguistic nature, there is a subtle gradification of perception, because by means of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states to attribute them side by side to others.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortex and brain stem devoted to body sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could easily participate in the feelings perceived by multiple animal genera.
In theory, I cannot contradict it, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear to us in rats and humans is probably felt by both organisms in the same way: But how is it possible to verify, Pankseep further says whether rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of experiencing.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, on the other hand, cockroaches and brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for the feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in a man: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who know?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how I should prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and language), I examine emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and in humans.
As with rats, I don't research my language and consciousness, I don't even experience feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It can be considered short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: Deadline for Grace for Poland and Ukraine
Acting Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said preparations would soon be directed directly by the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability together with Poland to hold ME," Vasjunyk said.
"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the early implementation of the time schedule for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are lagging.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the European Championship will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work as quickly as possible now," said the chairman of the Ukrainian union, Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will be constantly following us."
An even more radical move has been agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN union was dismissed and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport, Mirosław Drzewiecki.
It is said that there is a "serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini by letter that preparation for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer through this step."
Several teams from the Premier League were only doomed to forced descent due to manipulations last season, eventually having to be quickly moved to the start of the league.
Travel agents record increasing number of bookings
It looks like winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, bookings for the next few months increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans' appetite to travel remains unspoiled.
For bookings for the winter season, travel agencies saw a 31 percent increase in turnover over the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) said in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increased numbers of bookings are already available for the autumn months.
According to the DRV statement, the turnover for October was about eleven percent higher compared to 2007.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers, which evaluate each month the booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and interpolate them to the overall market.
This result included bookings of tours that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the dollar's weak exchange rate, travel to the U.S. is in demand, the DRV said.
For these trips, the increment of reservations is about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable for Germans.
Especially organized tours are on course, said DRV Chairman Klaus Laepple.
With regard to rising energy and food expenses, the costs are "more easily calculated for the client than for an individually organized holiday".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money by, among other things, using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was said to be very good, so compared to the previous year, higher turnover will be recorded again - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to make an ad for a new movie, she spoke in an interview about private things - and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke of her ex-Dennis Quaid as a subverter of marriage.
He's angry and he's striking back.
A delayed war of roses with former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors have had a nasty feud - in front of the public eye.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan commented for the first time on the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she only found out about the scale of the fraud after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - that tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's response to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: He's "crazy,"" the 45-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews on the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
Moreover, it is "regrettable" that the joint sixteen-year-old son Jack again "publicly resembles the pain and radical changes that divorce is for each child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his reflections on cheating like this: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself happy to have an amazing family that is doing great.”
Ticket prices and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent, according to one recent study.
Flights and hotel accommodation have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The firm analyzed its data on the bookings made from the first half of 2008 and, after the rise in prices in the first quarter, found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of prices on the hotel market grew, accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed still rose by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most noticeable was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than the previous year.
The cause of this trend is considered by American Express to be the weak exchange rate of the dollar, which caused "a declining appetite for American tourists to travel."
Financial centres were also more severely affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices by a rise of 26.3 percent even recorded a European record.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosine, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights increased by up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, ticket prices in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class classes the changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
They rose 11.9 percent from January to March, falling 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have fallen by even half.
One reason for this price fall is slowing economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profitable lines by air carriers and also the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone it was 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukaya continues to fail to assemble a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge the Failed Landing for Representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach was involved in the game late and failed with a poked ball on the stick.
His message was precisely worded and sounded convincing from his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break between half-times was over and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
And so his plea was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb as a sign of match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order was probably the same: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"It didn't look good here today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wished it more relaxed."
In 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers owe the header to Mladen Petrić (11th) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbass could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
This Monday, Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon, viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the lively updated table on the video wall, in which their team was listed as a premier.
It's going to be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the interim table result symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly finding themselves, but he is not yet able to flash.
"We need more affection and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
My first Oktoberfest
An endlessly repeated pop, beer from the bunds and prominent in costumes from well-known designers.
First time in the beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, TV presenter, and wears a tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we are not even three minutes on the beer meadow yet, and photographers are already throwing themselves at us and nimbly filling the memory cards - I'm flattered, after all, I'm at Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap costume has served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, and so my feeling of comfort in costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing a woman's costume or leather pants; no one looks in disgust or embarrassingly touched - everything is completely normal.
The odd looks at the banana stand in chocolate are only my apron.
One Municher warns me that I misuntied her: "You're free on the left, in the middle of a virgin, right assigned, widowed in the back."
I'll secretly shift the bow from behind to the left.
"Okay," he says, laughing.
Others with subtle flirting techniques don't deal so much with wearing simple felt hats with the words "To drunk to get dressed!" and stick out naked butts on passers-by.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, he is from England and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
It looks "gorgeous" to him, with an extended "óóó".
That's what he tells me after he's relieved himself of a drunken maze.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks it's trash cans.
Bob is one of the feared "Wildbieslers," as Bavarian people are called in public.
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, they run around the area where Oktoberfest is held, a lot of paramedics who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - in fours they wear a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to the beer meadow: empty there, full of back again.
Those who lie under the sail of this coffin of mischief are not visible.
"The so you who can't go on," one of the medics calls me in response to my question, and disappears into the crowd.
After the defeat in the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of a sinking rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to drop by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in one day in its history.
Later, Dow gained some weight.
Around 20.30, this world's most important stock exchange barometer showed a five percent drop to 10 579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in the minus.
The worst of it was in Dow at this point the American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
None of the titles were able to strengthen.
Goldman Sachs shares have lost nearly ten percent.
Just a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means to purchase so-called corrupt mortgage papers are to be made available.
However, the entire amount is not to be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive stock lists of financial companies that could be reimbursed with favorable exchange rate developments, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock courses in Europe are falling steeply
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US is not depriving investors of any doubt.
The exchange rate of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly descending and is withdrawing the Dax index.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing the state despite a planned financial market bailout.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pulled the German stock index (Dax) deep into the negative.
The shares of the Munich real estate financier lost up to three quarters of their value despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and, with a minus of 3.7 percent, scored 5,839 points.
Around the world, stock markets have gone to their knees.
In New York, a trading day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the U.S. government's 700 billion-dollar rescue package might not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first hour of trading, putting it at 10 809.25 points.
U.S. House of Representatives to vote on rescue plan, Senate could make comments 1. October.
Other European stock exchanges also took just one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11 743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18 286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at 12 595.75.
In MDAx, shares of Arcandor were lost after the announcement of the increase in capital.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed for 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourism group announced that it would not sell shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have not known how to deal with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravity slingshot).
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be quite correct.
For nearly 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" has flown through space.
Due to the fuel lines, which will soon freeze, she is now in danger of dying from the cold.
Among scientists for years, one mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion - the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot.
A gravitational sling is an aerial maneuver of space probes in which they acquire additional momentum in the gravitational field of a cosmic body, such as Earth.
Thanks to this, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick just like the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been saying in this case for years in wonder: flying bodies do not behave one hundred percent in the way that man would expect under the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was christened with an anomaly of the gravitational sling.
Several experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attractiveness of matter by curving space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot using the so-called dark matter, the presence of which in the universe has been discovered by astronomers.
"Responsible for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about a decade.
It is clearly based on a gravitational force, the effect of which on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, she herself is completely invisible, which means that she does not broadcast or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not just visible light.
According to scientists, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe is good from this dark matter.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, according to the Italian foreign minister in Egypt, kidnapped tourists are again at large.
The kidnappers of Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
In the shootout before his release, six kidnappers were said to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists introduced to the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports by Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed.
We're just verifying their health," Frattini said.
According to a report by Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, and also their eight Egyptian guides are in order and safe.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the firefight before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of them.
"The problem has been resolved.
They agreed to a ransom," the quoted worker said.
It was "just a matter of taking over the hostages" when "this surprise" suddenly came.
Sudanese troops on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot dead six kidnappers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom," citing one of the German intermediaries, said the release of the hostages was stretching because the kidnappers fear for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the hostages of the female sex after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Police release name of victim of accident
The name of a sixty-three-year-old woman who died in hospital after she was hit by a car in Essex has been released.
The accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon befell Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a fifty-one-year-old man was detained on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has already been released on police bail.
Abuse by stepfather 'led to suicide'
Several years of abuse by the stepfather led the woman to kill herself, the court heard.
After pleading guilty to eight cases of sexual harassment, seventy-seven-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
A Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in the confession.
It was also said in court that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise bound her and blindfolded her and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 80's and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was heard before the court that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was haunted by the specter of abuse that had been committed against her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court in 2006 that she was told by friends of Miss Randle, who also took great care of surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that she "relinquished her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She's thought to have suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle came face to face with his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I tied her and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been awful for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she had not done so, the matter would probably not have gone to trial at all.”
"I would especially like to highlight the consequences that, according to Stephanie's parents, your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"She would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on the train in June would be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top secret documents on a train to Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to police.
It is the least serious offense against the aforementioned law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defence Affairs correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the Cabinet Office," he said.
An employee who is not allowed to be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police indict the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained classified analyses of Al Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Credit unions face B&B debt
Britain's credit unions may have to settle for more than 80 million pounds in debt after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley with 14 billion pounds to protect deposits.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all firms that take client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Association of Credit Unions (BSA), said it was "humiliating" that credit unions and their members must pay.
The fourteen-billion-dollar debt will eventually be repaid by saving Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest that accumulates in the meantime will be paid each year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Cash Services Compensation Plan for the BBC confirmed that all 59 credit unions are counted in that issue.
It is humbling that these institutions, which have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from being so judicious
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said every firm is supposed to pay proportionally to the deposits it held, and that credit unions are supposed to pay about 18 per cent of the price from that.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the debt will rise to 450 million pounds in 2009.
That means the credit unions will have to find 81 million pounds to pay back interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the credit union trade association, told the BBC that he was convinced it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that have behaved judiciously during the expansion of the housing market now have to repay some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from being so judicious."
According to the BSA, no credit union has fallen since 1945 when it appeared.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter within the next few weeks to see what are the options to protect credit unions and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole added.
The interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this September to the end of March.
There will be interest to be repaid in 2010 for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since credit unions are shareholder-free mutual organizations, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates in their accounts.
Turkey's diplomatic horizons expand
Long before Turkey began to try to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into Turkey's borders.
On the eastern bank of the Bosphorus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in the neo-Renaissance style.
This is what tourist guides will tell you.
The building sits astride at the end of the platform with a tower on every corner of the front, indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once one gets inside the vaulted cash register, one can no longer have a doubt about the size of the business whose westernmost gate of the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium of the Anatolian-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which was late to play empires, intended to implement its ambitions to control the Middle East using this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen boundaries of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial troops advanced from Egypt, pushing Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hydarpasha station.
In 1917, an explosion of an ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually crumbling and history is bypassing it.
But today, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
Now a new policy is being applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I got on a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was supposed to meet with one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kinikioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a crushing ride on the tracks that reminded me of the old-world rhythms of the well-known documentary Night Post, I arrived in a Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigms of Turkish consensus.
In the west, she raised suspicions, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main AKP tent, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built department stores and power-based handlings, where medium-sized managers in commercial suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kinikioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its border.
Today, they have to look to the east and the west at the same time.
It was no choice.
It had to do both.
"But there will definitely come a time," I asked, "when will Turkey have to make a decision?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want such a decision to take place."
After that, he emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost by heart: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the surrounding Black Sea are as good for Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, drive on these tracks to the east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to the Hydarpasha station, after another mostly sleepy night, I thought of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Con, who watched this building build a century ago.
How surprised they would be to find that European ambitions in the Middle East can now be, in a substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting in the port for the ferry back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe."
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Milk costs five penci per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny price increase in February, and comes after research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the price increase in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshi ex-premier denied
Bangladeshi court rejects former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid's request for bail, which means that if she returns to her homeland, she could be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with accusations that she had received more than fifty million taka (729 700 dollars) from a businessman when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against it.
Khalida Ziya, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), has demanded that the local military-held government first give her complete freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was released on the word of honor in order to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the High Court order to the Supreme Court.
"The High Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, saying he did not need bail when he is already undergoing an examination released abroad on an affidavit," her defense attorney, Rafique-ul Huq, said in a statement.
"We will appeal the High Court order."
Her lawyers argued she needed bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December election.
A senior People's League official said Sheikh Hasina is due to return home after 17. October.
She was detained last year after an interim government took power by the army, but was released from prison in June to allow her to go abroad for medical intervention.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khalida Ziya both deny all the charges against each other.
Fears about polio vaccinations in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200 000 children did not attend the recent widespread vaccination against polio due to Taliban-related violence.
The U.N. last week carried out vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says she could not reach children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises that it would not attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers from working.
BSkyB loses ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost a lawsuit to review the decision of the Competition Commission, which ordered the firm to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV share from 17.9% below 7.5%.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB's share was obstructing a competitive struggle and giving the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that, as a result, prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Office announced that acquiring a stake in ITV by BSkyB had given cause for doubts about ITV's independence, and called on the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin consortium chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer organizations and Ofcom regulator were all opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its stake in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution disproportional - primarily because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the American lawyers affair
The U.S. chief prosecutor has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where a report of an affair prepared by the Justice Department's chief inspector criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmaker and former Justice Secretary Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the attorneys had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: "Serious allegations including potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Justice Department stripped nine U.S. attorneys in December 2006 of their post.
Back then, the ministry said the attorneys had been fired because of weak performances.
However, it later emerged that the dismissal of the lawyers were no worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the layoffs were motivated politically.
Some of the attorneys were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter deception made against the Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are investigating and conducting lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the dismissal and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The inspector general's report spoke very critically of the role of Gonzales in the affair, saying that he was "mainly responsible" for the redundancies, that he "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "not remarkably involved" in the events.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterfoll will be honored
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem, Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend a ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" with recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
The nomination for this year is led by Coldplay, which has made the shortlist in four categories.
Paul Rees, principal editor of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand above such things, like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It began with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell has been on the charts for about nine years, selling more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, in 2003 he was also operated on due to an irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street, often forgotten and perhaps early for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only utility.
But even many taxi drivers-veterans and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This tiny aisle is in the East Village neighborhood and leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage than a traffic route.
There are no signs with street names.
In a regular atlas, it is virtually invisible.
However, the aisle has admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to pave Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques that are supposed to open in new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were enchanted by the shortened aisle simply because it was one of the last remains of the time the block was ennobled.
However, the Municipal Office for the Protection and Development of Development, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the municipal community's land committee, representatives of the municipal authority and Avalon Bay outlined a plan under which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the district manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee favors such a variant where the street remains in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"Public and administration proposals could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wanted to newly pave the small street and plant seats, several of which would be used by a cafe whose interest in renting the premises the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main intention is to repair this desolate aisle and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for the Preservation of Development, said the city actually wanted to sell the street, noting that the job of his office was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's large farm was divided among several of his children, and no one was entitled to that narrow strip of land.
The back door of the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the aisle is perhaps best known as the background for a photo on the cover of the Ramones album's album "Rocket to Russia."
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the refinement of the East Village neighborhood, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that that piece of public property, albeit modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's disappearing New York (subtitled "The Book of Laments: A Bitterly Nostable View of the City in the Process of Extinction"), posted part of the story of Extra Place from the section Talking About the City, which appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even in the daytime and bounded by rusty iron gates of warehouses and hammered windows, where a week-old newspaper is scattered in ditches."
With a few exceptions, the aisle of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat ran across the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, in the place of which today stands an expensive clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers lay an empty beer bottle.
A few passers-by said they rarely think about Extra Place, but suggested that some kind of boost might be useful to him.
By contrast, Fields said he thought some people underestimated the appeal of the aisle in her current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places of dark, damp and disgusting."
The Bilingualism Debate: Immersion in English
In this edition of the section Focus on Education will be Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discussing candidates' attitude to bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, co-authored the book "Worse than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools."
Effectively reaching out to Hispanic voters is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama's educational agenda only proves it.
Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students are substantially less likely to graduate than white pupils," which is true.
To combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda promotes, in particular, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are just learning English.
The question for Barack Obama, however, is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes that languages other than English are used in the classroom, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles County East.
The pupils of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are just learning English.
Even so, in the 2008 state math tests, a whopping one hundred percent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level.
Almost the same amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-grade pupils have reached the highest level in state tests in English and literature.
This incredible achievement has been achieved by a different method than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Further, and Obama should notice this, according to Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, the pedagogical approach of the school for those who are just learning English is "complete immersion."
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me: "We had tremendous success with one completely new pupil from Mexico - after twelve months you would walk into class and not know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take the school as Sixth Street Prep as a role model for what other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English-learning pupils should look like?
The results achieved by the school should take the answer to this question for granted, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make it unclear to predict Obama’s response.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he declared that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wishes to erase performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work than mock them and trivialize them.
Oil is falling sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of fears that even the U.S. plan to save financial markets might not revive the economy.
Prices of term oil trades fell by as much as 7 percent in the morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange to 99.80 dollars per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than twenty dollars a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial riots on Wall Street and also by a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of 145.29 dollars per barrel in July, prices fell earlier this month to almost 90 dollars a barrel, after which they again jumped on the wave of huge uncertainty of financial markets.
The anxiety re-conjected investors on Monday, even after the Congressional Bureau announced it had reached an agreement over the weekend over the biggest rescue plan on record.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the advancing disintegration, the government announced that Citigroup would buy a banking section of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the frenzied weekend negotiations that led to a plan to save the economy "prove to be incapable of reviving the mood in the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"Prospects for markets for global stocks, interest rates and exchange rates have become very uneasy," analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the U.S. virus will spread around the world and especially to China.”
Analysts at the bank have cut their expectations for next year as oil consumption has fallen due to slower growth in the economy, and have cut their gasoline price forecasts for 2009 by about 20%.
Wild ride in second quarter breaks team record
After spending more time in the Jets' jersey over the past eight seasons than anyone, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had already seen everything.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a splendid ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the bleak clouds above each other with their troubled game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly foreshadowing an afternoon in which their gradually unfolding collaboration moved forward miles.
Favre sent Coles in that quarter behind the other two touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before the half of the game.
"It wasn't anything extraordinary," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We communicated well, no matter what people think.”
While the Favre and the Coles were throwing, the defense was attacking Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it by 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked out another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals' team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal from the field, taking a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets have ever gained in one quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when he was invited to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said: "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
There were many points in a short period of time.”
Rested Gebreselassie improves his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2-mile-long race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track in a time of 2:03:59, he overwhelmed by 27 seconds his previous time of 2:04:26, which he ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he has broken the world record or at least is a world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed the Beijing Olympics marathon because he feared - in hindsight perhaps too alarmed - that polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on longer tracks dropped their marathon record in the last decade by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in a time of 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters he had calf cramps two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break obviously aroused him rather than delayed him.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was in a bit of a doubt today, but everything was fine.'
He was also criticised - mainly in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for overly planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon leaders, relying on wires as if it were a race on the track, and setting world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's huge running qualities.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenyans, Gebreselassia reached half in a time of 1:02:04.
After the conductors fell away, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal, Gebreselassi last took over and ran off to Kwambai, who then finished second in a time of 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in a time of 2:07:48.
In the women's race, the excellent year was completed by the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19, Irina Mikitěnková, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a citizen of Germany.
A record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe of the UK.
The thirty-six-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won last spring in the London Marathon in a time of 2:24:14.
She skipped the Beijing Games because of something that was described as a back injury but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon she ever ran, she improved her personal best by nearly five minutes.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape into a big lead and then after about 18 1⁄2 miles she pulled them.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in a time of 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles of the life of blacks in a separate city
Hidden among the larger Orlando's sprung theme parks, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and difficulty of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquette courses, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of quality, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Edonville to pay tribute to the Hurstons, the Harlem Renaissance's most famous female writer.
The city she described remains aside even though it has made it a stop for tourists by including him in a Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of races, many of the residents here remain cautious about the views of foreigners.
"We're very careful about how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city's oldest parish.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and exertion.
It is both a historical model of black rise and a community of nearly 2400 people where the poverty rate is double that of the national average.
It is the center of literature, but also oaks shielded by an example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that originated from American slavery.
It is not very surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And the worries about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of dialects such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide turned the city into a road no. 17, which leads through the often neglected center of Florida, into the stage of black history and human drama.
With the punch of a big drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the shop of the first Edonville mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"To the left next to the road," she wrote, "is a white brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained yards and a playground that Howard Miller always cares about, though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything at all that fits into an hourly hotel."
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, re-closing marriages and sex.
This was clearly not a typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says ninety-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson Girls' Choir, which made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered as a chipper eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time when she rushed into the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of a decent dress today.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were sneering.
"The people of Zor always loved to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were taken out of the press.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten about it, along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major funerals or major public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood her significance for the world or her legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's "Wrapped in Rainbows" biopic, published in 2003.
The change came in the 80's of the 20th century.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, a local two-lane main road.
The spread of Orlando had already pushed through the interstate highway No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to mix races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At the time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things on people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"Actually, we had a lady who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration, and her decision in the Brown case against the Chamber of Education said it was "insulting to my race rather than glorifying."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, even though it was positive in some areas, reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"Black children were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," N said. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
That lasted until teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped create space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudices with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can someone deny themselves the pleasure of my presence!
I won't understand that."
In 1975, Alice Walker reached Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a vicaculated biography of Hurston by Robert E came to the shelves in bookstores. Hemenway, who re-enlisted her in the American canon.
The project with the highway arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter had found the ramp lights again.
The former Hurston neighbors have now considered her a savior.
To show what can happen to its highway to destroy, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to the celebration.
The state backed off the highway proposal after several years.
"The five streams of the highway have resurrected, you'd say it directly detonated, real civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Winning over the highway project has helped change the image of the city.
The extra-towns like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the local church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historic Registry in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named, of course, after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a sunken aisle in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today, 90 percent are black.)
Strangers who come in search of the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
It is necessary to have permission for most interviews in advance and certain things - like murals in the oldest Edonville church, painted by white people and depicted by blacks in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a bold, confident teacher who likes deep red, still worry that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival grew larger, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, with problems and such, but not better, not worse and just as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
The voice of Franklin's nephew, eighteen-year-old Edwin Harvey, is a genuine love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in a local government or with the police, who he says would take some help.
And even younger ones, such as the eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenon, apparently, have learned to describe Eatonville right.
"Most people, when they just drive through here, think, 'Hm, this city is nothing against the others,'" said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak fluently financially
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If Manhattan tourists had stayed away from Newstacks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't have realized they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in the glass-filled beehive of offices over their heads, every day, bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York have the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The metsmen are still rumbling with metal carts on the sidewalks and are carrying muffin pans to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts that hang from the scales on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the street menus, and it's still not possible to get a yellow cab between four and seven in the afternoon on a weekday.
It didn't look like a crisis at all, until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to open a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this task to cover with a late afternoon siesta at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were already about twenty people waiting in the queue.
Not in front of the cash registers to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the counter where older clients order cheque books, tourists ask about the way to the Macy's convenience store, and new customers set up bills.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason as I did.
However, compared to me, they have already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in the places where they arrived, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They have collected money from so-called thrifts (a bit similar to building societies), cash associations and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state, and which claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have gone quietly bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a 327-billion-dollar asset bank, went into bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with assets worth $440 billion, tried to hunt down a bailout buyer.
Office and shop staff who stood in front of me and feared another collapse were moving their cash to a bank that is seen as a safe haven and which makes most of the bailout on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned their financials fluently over the past week.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket was talking on the phone and speaking to Lehman Borthers, the bankrupt bank, and her skinny chief executive, Dick Fuld, with such familiality, as if she were scratching a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed roughly fifty-year-old housekeeper of my apartment building, has changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me: "I have my savings in money market funds now.
I moved it, I won't take any chances.'
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's music leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, 9/11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As part of the district music plan, he founded an excellent choir of young Proteus for a year.
He was supposed to be under the age of 21, but by the time Proteus sang last time in 1979, a few of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changer) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to embark on any music that was presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often stunning, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanging all the time.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself."
He said: "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it! "
His baton technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever the musical standard was, he always lifted it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be knighted, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the two decades when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I've reviewed more than 100 of his concerts over the past 40 years and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed with any of them - and I've been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "pulled one or two soaked rocks around the world."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary, William Woodruff (25 September), claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher on Houblon-Norman...while studying at BSc, MA and PhD."
This is based on Woodruff's note from the author's in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry, which was led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff has gone over this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from Austria's right-wing Free Party and Filip Dewinter of Belgium's right-wing Vlaams Belang party, is taking part in a demonstration that presented the "Cities Against Islamization" organization in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that display mosques crossed out of the red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extreme right-wing parties made huge gains in general elections.
More than 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were severely damaged between Friday evening and this morning, and the police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits spray-painted Jewish symbols such as David's star on some graves, but detectives are convinced that it may have been an attempt to disguise the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration that comes as the Muslim month of Ramadan nears the end.
Austria, meanwhile, is entering the wheel of finding its own soul after it swung to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which received more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, have waged a vehemently anti-immigrant campaign, and some of their slogans have been condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Free Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against headscarves and burqas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to the food in which the relationship to Islam is perceived.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" designed to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the elections that put the extreme right in the position of the country's strongest political bloc suggest that this change was mainly due to young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed on a trip abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned by the court from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials have imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing monitoring authorities that he plans to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police were granted a travel ban last Thursday after giving officials evidence of Glitter's past sentences for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A judicial service spokesman said: "On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kent police asked for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd did not attend personally.”
The 64-year-old Glitter informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as required by his record in the register of sexual attackers.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They also have to hand over the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If the duty to inform the authorities omitted, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible travels around the county.
A Kent police spokeswoman said: "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to track someone who stays in Britain because we have vast systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent residents is a top priority for the Kent police, and we are working closely to monitor the behaviour of recorded sexual assailants to reduce any danger to the public to a minimum.”
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was due to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not let him pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his attorney, David Corker, went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in west London, and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order that required him to register as a sex attacker.
Glitter was previously jailed in the UK for four months for owning child pornography.
An Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, is calm and glad Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master off the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no ruffles or costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, detached from the focus on interpretation - I will only achieve the relaxed expression of a man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other - man.
Inseparable, apart from privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then one can see a confidential gesture, the depth of a glimpse of the captured gaze, or the passionate gesture of the hands, which are carefree, because they are not going to step on the scene.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of performing with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which runs as part of the moon photography program flamenca (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the ever-increasing international importance of flamenco," the author says, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photos, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people, portrayed "on the street", are artists capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that will allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portrait flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The application of different stylistic means contradicts the classical basis of the film and lends it to the contemporary spirit, which is an idea that, according to Bauer himself, is mirrored by flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which, however, continues to surprise and evolve."
What pulls the audience is not the action of the dance itself, singing or play, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we encounter the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, it was and is a constant of the work presented during these days in the El Fotomata gallery.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists is shaped by well-known characters of flamenco, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco and will soon be published in a book, which will contain exhibited portraits.
The passion for portraiture led Bauer to the idea of repeating the idea of "Portraits of a Sports Veteran" ("SportARTproject") two years ago.
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people," the photographer admits that "photographing people, getting to know them and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think in photography, the portrait is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or encounters people, personalities he sometimes doesn’t even know, or give him only a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is on display in the El Fotómata Gallery in de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16. October.
Vargas Llosa has admitted that the novel he writes is "prudence"
It takes place in an environment he does not yet know, and tells the stories of unknowns to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully realize his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in Congo for twenty years and traveled in the Amazon.
The Eternal favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is currently employing him "is assureness" and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will, and I believe I will finish it someday," concluded his post at the festival of exchanges of ideas, ideas and words, which in four days saw around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in the city of aqueduct.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo theatre to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had an audience in front of him, whose hour of time passed like water - a Peruvian with amazing precision and a considerable amount of humor, remembered how from the original "incredible adventure" of "pleasure of a passionate reader" and from "the power to live more than I lived" was born a literary mission; how he subscribes "insufficient inspiration"how they influenced his writings Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "recollective images" are the main foundation of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change their lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a mere entertainment, a fleeting experience" - Vargas Llosa emphasized that, according to him, "he affects people" and "forces them to try to step out of line", and urged the writers not to "succumb to their frivolity" and "take responsibility"
Because of climate science, the festival in Pozoblanc - a lack of a spear
The performance with the spears, which concludes the celebration in Pozoblanc, was cancelled yesterday morning after the performances' announcement was confirmed that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That's why the company, along with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfighting.
Unfavorable meteorological conditions have plagued this celebration for a long time, two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain made the course of the second planned bullfighting impossible.
During them, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista was to be built by bulls in the arena on Castilblanc.
This is how it was celebrated only on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and was rewarded for a dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance on his shoulders.
On the same day in the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two spear wounds for greetings and one ear, which was brought to him by uncovered seats in the arena rather than toreador art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the bull arena of Los Llanos, who was ungreasy.
In the second round of hard work without a single respite, he earned sharp criticism from most of the audience.
They ran a check in Álava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hash
In ten minutes five.
Road inspection of Ertzaintza in the municipal district of Armiñón (Álava).
The members stop two people driving in the van and they are suffering.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Interior Department of the Basque government, members pursued and detained one of the people driving in the van, a man aged 38, who was identified as A. A. J.
The detainee was charged with drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit were conducting a roadside inspection on the N-1 in places where it passes through the border of the Armiñón district.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated sharply and drove away.
The members of the car immediately began to prosecute until the vehicle stopped at the side of the road a few kilometers away, at which point the two passengers jumped up and fled into the forested vegetation.
The members of Ertzaintza eventually caught up with one of them and seized 2 178 kilograms of hash, which the suspects were transporting, as it turned out during a search of the Iveco Daily brand.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with bundles of hashish, which were subsequently transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the license plate is "wrinkled" and does not agree with the data provided in the documents of the delivery, the detainee was therefore also charged with falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to flee in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
Detained A. A. J., 28, was transferred to the police department to handle the appropriate formalities before further investigation is taken.
Actress Heather Locklear detained for driving under the influence of medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the favorite of Amanda from the series Melrose Place, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of medication.
The witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers while trying to drive out of the parking lot in Montecito, a California road patrol spokesman told People magazine.
The witness specified that around 16.30 p.m. Locklear "treading violently on the gas, driving back and forth in a noisy roar, trying to get out of the parking space - she ran over her sunglasses several times while reversing."
The witness, who apparently didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the vehicle.
The person also alerted the emergency services because they "were worried about Locklear's life."
When a police patrol arrived on the scene, they found the actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the roadway.
"She looked disoriented," and that's why members took her to a specialized drug and alcoholic center to submit to the test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were immediately excluded, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was evident to the officers at first sight."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of the effects of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 19.00, although she was released hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety conditions and depression.
Llamazares urges the IU's Andalusian association to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The head general of the IU and the MP for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the final decision in the case of the former councillor of the Youth and Sports department in Seville Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of acting in favor of his family, will depend on the party's regional association.
"I'm too federalist for this, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares suggested of the negotiations, which the party will have to proceed with in relation to a former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that in the case of an investigation into the illegal conduct committed by Silva, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "The IU has always fought to ensure that such matters are maximally transparent."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions."
"The Blood of May" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garci's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "Sangre de mayo", inspired by the episodes from the national past of Benito Pérez Galdós, revives the famous rebellion of the Spaniards against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "render the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of the company" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, along with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during the presentation of the film in front of an extensive team of performers.
The flower blood with a metre of over two and a half hours will be released in cinemas this Friday and more than four hours of television series Telemadrid is about to take place in the future.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós José Luis Garci, he claims to have fulfilled the "children's dream" by making this film, which is due to Esperanze Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to make a film on the bicentennial of Madrid on May 2, accepting the offer, saying that the story will be based on the Episodes of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid has completely contributed, means for Garcio a "unique opportunity" to create an environment with scenery and costumes corresponding to the image of "a cross-breaking Spain that was wrong in the leader for whom it was to fight - the struggle for independence led to the decline and backwardness of the country during the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support that has been given to the films Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goya's Ghosts - almost twice the blood of May - so he could not make some of the scenes from the script signed simultaneously by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he works almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empezar) works as he is usually used to - on the scene along with the actors with whom he usually tries before filming and with whom he does not choose casting, because he finds it "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the director's profession is, among other things, to go to theaters and cinemas and so learn what is happening in the craft".
Many of the actors he has chosen for May Blood have appeared in front of his camera for several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga and Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four Oscar nominations, one of whom he won, is of the opinion that none of the three female candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Flower Blood itself, the Seven Tables of French Biliar and the last selected Blind Sunflower, represents a young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "it is yet to appear."
There are no awards for this film Garci.
"At first you think you're working for what happens after that, but then you realize that you're only working for earnings, and so you're going to make one more movie," Garci explains with more than a 30-year director's career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
The Seville flamenca dancer will pay tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of the Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and when she was three years old, they moved with her family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering women's emancipation such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the abolition of a corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, enchanted Isabella Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not interested in telling her life, it's about grasping her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "butterfly dance" evoked my guajira or "snake dance" some thong.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic also corresponds," she argues.
The performance envisages the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Poded, who will sing in one performance just like in the "Open Door" (La puerta abierta), and with dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and accepted cooperation with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents the older Tórtola, a mature figure.
I'm happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honour for me.'
In the performance, he also counts on the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájar, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of the actor Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of an eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are prima donas with everything, and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who took place in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who have a huge influence at some time, but today no one knows her and even less appreciates her work," Bayón says.
The show begins today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina's "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black-and-white photographs are amazing.
I was attracted by the simplicity and strong charge with which it affects the audience, and with respect and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments.”
The book "The Diary of the Freshly Married" also closes the triennial
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "The Newly Made Journal" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the site where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Trienal of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the aim of celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize
"The Triennial of Zenobie and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The One Ray of the Sun", which opened in May this year, and after it tours the various Andalusian provinces, it should move to the New York Congress at the time of the congress.
The Autonomous Andalusian Government's Cultural Council also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Diary of the Freshly Married" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue spreading awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's most holy Andalusian poets.
America, without Paul Newman, doesn't like itself so much anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Evil Intent" and under the weight of knowing that Newman had left, reveals his dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how it took them to get an Oscar.
And that he has been retired since 2007.
And that it was known that he was gravely ill.
He was a big guy for everyone.
"Sometimes what a person feels can't be expressed in any way, and I've lost a great friend now," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country were better because of it."
No one was afraid that he would be ridiculous or exaggerated.
The father of film and homeland has died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom, when reasons for pride are desperately sought.
When the time is rough and people without virtues and only a handful of those who are worth your admiration - there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from a foundation against drug addiction based on the honor of a first-born son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home-cooked food and organic food.
A complete treasure for the country, which has cost a lot of effort to free itself from a suicidal eating culture.
A thunderous wave of admiration has flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said that not one man died, but one era.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning director of Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without exaggeration the pinnacle of his career.
A bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman lived - he prides himself on honesty and leads a serious private life far from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and has since been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was loyal to, though he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a fillet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him be proud in heaven for having harmony between his daughters and admirers on earth - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a self-sacrificing philanthropist."
The Imperfect Races of the Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us are eager to have the Olympics held in Madrid, and after a failed 2012 it will be maybe 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we follow yesterday's race, I say: no!
He was referred to as a perfect race, and in my opinion, he was the worst I've ever been on.
Such a bunch of nonsense that right away, if it came to the assessment and I was the examiner, it would be clear insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, nice one by one.
Nonsense begins with picking up the racing number, because of which one has to go early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when you go there, let them give him everything (including a chip to prevent the runway from overcrowding).
Oh, no.
Here you had to pick up the number first (the first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after standing up the appropriate queue) - what a surprise! - had only a T-shirt size S (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only small T-shirts, because it is less fabric and they are cheaper?
Well, those are small things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early for the chip and the queue insisted on it for over 15 minutes, the backpack still had to be handed over there.
Over 35 minutes took the waiting time, which is something incomprehensible at the race, where 11 000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put down our backpacks yet, and when it did, it was much worse with the pick-up.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes by rain, which led to a general revolt and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, will not see the right time in evaluating the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, did not correctly record the start time.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn't have occurred to me.
And so I think we'll have to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition and human interaction system in the way of artificial intelligence - not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like summoning a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a delivery boy who would move around the company's premises) and perceive what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they're wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
It can also sort those present by conversational groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third party and understands that he does not belong to the group that talks to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if he's going to see someone, and tells her he'll be taking care of her in a moment.
All this without a blue screen of death.
Awesome.
Of course, this is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, for example, a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won't have that many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured out that if computers had the most necessary, without the burden of commercial uselessness, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discovering as thunder when considering that Microsoft is adding new features and more "extras" to the version from the version.
A change of direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its relevance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who was inclined to the theory that it was Google’s first step towards competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
An operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
It never goes away, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to launch Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around the windows.
What is the purpose of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a small example.
I took this photo in one of the rest rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the beverage machine that begged them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count on 2010.
At Microsoft, they will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one glowed in Edward Zwick's "Bloody Diamond," just like Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppoly's "Godfather," plus he's part of the uniform of a muscular gay community.
And if we want to get into the list of his life roles, we can dive into the image of a typical muscleman with a pointed mustache, who lifts dumbbells in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it is nothing more than a typical cotton men's bottom tank top, tight and sleeveless.
English speakers call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all the others.
First, for his broken name - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as the legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the singer's lover Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost unnoticeable) Belgian flag, which models have the most emblematic tank tops as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
It also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, baby clothes, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame that they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
Honda attacks for second time with its bestseller
In November, Honda will begin the sale of the second-generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already has considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is joined by improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow for greater fuel efficiency.
Evolution rather than revolution.
Such is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this single-space car.
It is worth mentioning, for example, the innovative design, the new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we will notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case for Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
It has sold almost a million copies in Japan since the launch of Honda Jazz.
The second market became the old continent with approximately half a million units sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims to increase sales in its category for the new Jazz.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 estimates counted with 100 000 cars, which would increase by 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which translates to 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
In terms of the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2 000 units for the whole year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The automaker’s management is de facto expecting the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is a Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid of compact size with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200 000 units a year.
In terms of markets, according to Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will be split by the old continent and Japan.
The start of Honda Insight's sales is expected in the first months of next year once it is unveiled to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has increased all dimensions.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
The increase in dimensions also increased the interior.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of the luggage compartment in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur with the 1.4 engine version, since the luggage compartment volume of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement, in addition to the exterior elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping with a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows the opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 in the first Jazz model.
With the second-generation Honda Jazz, the engines are also new.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and delivers excellent improvements to the propulsion system at the same time with high torque in full engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine has a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation of the Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which in the previous generation was 83 hp, the current one will reach 100.
The Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 hp has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and an emission of 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mother. Whoever's the father doesn't worry me.'
A huge form with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though tiny in nature, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters take their new work in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, that means a lot more than just that some pretty, famous girls lend their name.
In Paris, she participated in a promotion organized by Mango at her new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion prizes that this Spanish company sponsors.
She is cordial and timid and will get you up close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this season autumn-winter, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
It was a busy, but also exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
Both I and my sister love movies from the 50's and 60's and we drew a lot of stimuli from them.
I also love wandering around the city and watching women walk around dressed, combining and layering their clothes, I do this very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I liked my clothes since I was a little girl, I still wanted to go to my grandmother's house, go through my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the way I walk dressed.
You know, we dancers pride ourselves on how well we are, so that we feel good about our lessons and exams when looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you actually penetrate the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 recently, did the crisis fall on you?
No. No.
I feel better than ever, I enjoy my 30s.
I find that a woman is already finished, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've been doing what I want since I was a kid, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know I'll be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mum, I don't want to miss it.
When it comes to fathers, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the film, you're about to make several premieres of the films you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to them coming to cinemas.
I come from the theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and that's not the way it is.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like...
You had your premiere on the catwalk a few days ago alongside Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to stand on the pier like a model.
I was just called by Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her organization "Women for a Better Life," and the clothes we showed off - I also chose two models from our collection for Mango - was auctioned off and the proceeds were handed over to this Naomia NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things about her, and I, because I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm going to stick to the good he's involved in.
She asked me to show off for charitable causes, but when she asks me to do a handstand, I do it too.
For the benefit of the women of the Third World, I will do what is needed.
"Car bee" prevents precipitation
This time, Nissan was inspired by advances in the development of accident-protecting technologies in nature, specifically in bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the pattern of flying bees, thus preventing collisions.
This is Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. robot have developed, in collaboration with the Centre for Advancement in Scientific and Technology Research, Japan’s prestigious University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doi, CEO of public relations for technology, research and brand development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four safety shield zones.
The robot is tasked with strengthening the ability to prevent collisions in this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, the most important are the compound bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in their personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual function, engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder.
It records obstacles that are located up to two meters in the 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"At the moment an obstacle is recorded, the robot mimics the bee's movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to a right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that all evasive manoeuvres are absolutely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and the direction in which it is allowed to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as in bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robot from colliding.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and behave according to this data.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuition from previous manoeuvres, thanks to which it can operate without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we're not talking about a gig or a mega."
This is the first step in the development of new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts for use in production cars in a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the finish line while avoiding obstacles on the way.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will need to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol has to install a system in his car that prevents him from starting a car while drunk or if he does not breathe.
The proposal became known in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Prosecutor General’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to return the driver to the wheel, therefore drivers will also have to take a traffic re-education course.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, the General Directorate of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Car Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of the carmakers charged more than once while driving drunk in this state will get behind the wheel again.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if a higher than the permitted concentration of alcohol is recorded.
Its price exceeds 1 000 euros and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study conducted in this sense in the U.S. in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device decreased by 65% during the first year since its introduction.
In Spain, 115 people could save their lives each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to help its introduction, because the legislation can be implemented in the usual way, but the necessary regulation of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been rehearsally installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 17.40 hours, as it stood in the program, it landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexicoico D. F. the plane of the Spanish Air Force, in which the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was setting, but its rays were still forcing the eyes to shield their eyes with their hands in order to see the successive pair coming out of the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials stood under the steps.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, you can't get people to the airport at that time... She's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
- Yeah, well, yeah...
The Mexican press, however, knows full well who the prince and princess of Asturias are and how significant their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just by the red carpet and military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorable salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a suit of dark blue color, and the princess, very sparingly dressed and with her hair loose, does not have her usual "peeptoes," apparently reported to her that in D. F. there's a storm.
Before they go to the hall, where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and casually pose for them.
At the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, a chatty Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury, except that it has enough capital to give injections, is not lacking ingenuity.
In the face of a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages with banks with questionable solvency, it has created a popular-educational game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
The "Hotel of Bad Credit"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel, and especially its receptionist, looks bleak to think twice, twice, whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not too detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than space for the entire public.
What happens when the game ends?
A dream room will appear inside the hotel.
At least something, because you better not talk about buying a house...
The best subsidized fashion price
There is probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion prize than Paris, and it is probably not a more excellent designer and bonvivan than Valentino.
Mango has just announced its second annual El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow an international presentation to new talents in fashion.
The price is subsidized by the amount of 300 000 euros.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the first-year winner, looked at her designs in the Mango winding-up at Paris's Haussmann No. 54 and almost wept with emotion.
Sure, it is the second largest store of this company in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1 335 square meters.
The largest is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank designer Valentin for taking over the chairmanship of the competition jury, caused us to eventually have a sumptuous dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
The Mango's festively decorated presidency table looked even more amazing alongside Chagall's most outstanding works.
Nati, who had shown nothing with her heart-broken grief over her brother's recent death, put on the ELAH's dress and ELAH's jewels, over which he was holding his breath, and hung in her son Luis - a nearly two-foot-long elegance - accompanied Valentin at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took the welcome and, as a true gentleman, remained without a blank, along with Baron Rothschild, for they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - hand-designed - trousers and shirt and changed into long black sexy dresses for dinner, was moved by a night walk around the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the hall for ballet rehearsals and, recalling other times, she grabbed one of the bars and hinted at "grand plié."
Inés Sastre did not stay for a tour of the palace's buildings, but she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before leaving.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorbike - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no smells be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Parisian sky.
Oh là, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about a chaotic and frenzied everyday life.
And to make matters worse, all are summarized in one book, which on September 30 will bring relaxation to the bookstore.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 p.m. as punishment, but even worse is to imagine yourself absorbed in the rushed rhythm that brings the current life.
The office is called tension and the computer has back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of detaching yourself from the world of work.
No, that number is no bigger and no less than 1001.
Outside of yoga, classical massage and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book, Susannah Marriott has collected a whole "menu" of options, tailored to the tastes and time possibilities of each individual.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you don’t have adrenaline in your veins that restore balance to your body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, switch off, and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may startle you, but it's actually insignificant.
It is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokvie.
It is quite common, especially for children and adolescents.
I'm sure they told many of you that he was talking in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime in high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is not just one reason to explain her rise.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night terrors, enuresis nocturna (night bedwetting) or sleepwalking, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or inflamed situations.
In any case, it is a little-explored phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (cries, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great strength, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that provokes great anxiety and manifests himself in this way.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind some very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the child too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who can relax the work, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them to gain a certain inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somnilokvia appears, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and that from what happened, the next day he will not remember anything.
Useful advice
Don't be him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you interrupt his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Remember that if you seem to be suffering very much several times in a row, it would be advisable to turn to advice or find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If it is to understand what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and pull information from him.
It will be of no use, because when he sleeps, he is not conscious to organize his thoughts.
Plus, you'll hear what he's saying, but you don't know what he's dreaming about, and why he's saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're coming to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
Don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again after a long, skinny period.
Without playing a particularly big match, the yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to turn one of them victoriously.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers were difficult to assert themselves.
After the first attempt of the captain, Kauffmann, who missed the line by a shot from a distance, began to have a light upper hand, and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain for a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defense of Dannemarie.
The opponent, by contrast, built a defensive wall halfway through the pitch and left only the agile Riahi on the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to Dannemaria's two chances with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well situated to process the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, the Illhaeusern goalkeeper did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and leave his teammates in weakening.
Dannemarie, however, could not get out of it, and the eleventh from Illhaeusern, who just pulled back a little to "thicken" the defense, no longer caused any more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball after a big confusion flew very close to the beam.
Sarkozy goes to meet angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a detour through Brittany.
To counter the demonstration by the strength of fishermen, who on Monday severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports, the French president decided to head to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives there.
The latter have vowed to be adopted "in a constructive spirit," and hope to "come up with concrete proposals."
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to get measures against a sharp increase in diesel prices, which reached a peak exceeding an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their businesses regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions of employment and disbursement of seafarers."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fishermen with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an "snail" operation (operations of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10km of congestion.
The holiday harbour in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction of Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter dam was opened on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The seamen demonstrated their determination as early as Monday, when they were burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots in Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the la Manche canal, as to the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the traulers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before they decide to act themselves.
In Guilvinec, the "Crisis Committee" is scheduled to decide on Tuesday how to continue the journey and to participate in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Briton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the state's fisheries department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishermen will not abandon anything" and "do not want to come to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairwoman of the Lorient Fisheries Department.
Occupational fishermen who do not pay diesel tax currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but judge that the threshold of profitability of the ship is reached only when the diesel is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman magnificent
An unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes bowed to the legend of the film and the politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery requirements for 2008
Brazil's aircraft maker is counting on the delivery of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession hovering over the world economy.
The world's fourth aircraft designer, Embraer, maintains its delivery requirements for 2008 with 215 supplied instruments, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has supplied Chinese clients with 41 devices over a span of eight years.
AIG is said to be considering a transfer of 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which U.S. money authorities have been given the water, is considering advancing more than 15% of its assets in order to pay back the $85 billion it was given to it as a down payment, reports Sunday's edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance policies in the international field and pension activity in the United States, the newspaper specifies, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
The AIG Board of Directors met Sunday evening to examine the eventual referral, according to the FT.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its alliance of air leasing International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance policyholder Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and investment in private equity, the FT adds.
No final decision on these referrals has yet been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must urgently raise cash in order to repay the 85 billion loan provided to it by the Federal Reserve Bank at the risk of the U.S. authorities seizing 80% of its capital, thereby diluting it to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the Historical Meeting of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange posted a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to bail out banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The biggest scoring in its history so far (by 684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trading after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, with its predominant technological component, lost 199.61 points, according to definitive data after the trading close and settled at 1 983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106,55 points.
dejected since the start of the session, Wall Street has literally plummeted after an unexpected rejection of a plan to bail out banks by the House of Representatives, a plan that was supposed to allow it to find a bit of stability in the markets again.
228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to provide the Secretary of State for the Treasury, Henry Paulson, with the funds he asked for.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to a posted market that sees Congress is unable to adopt a certain plan," Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said in a statement.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late."
"If this project is indeed doomed, the relay will be immediately handed over to the Fed and other central banks to spark a crisis, which would strengthen credit conditions more," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And with an emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza said, “Every new day brings the downfall of a financial institution.”
After Friday's crash, Washington Mutual's authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia bank's banking activities by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn and has demanded urgent intervention in favour of banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not facing "the US crisis, but the world crisis," an analyst at FTN Financial added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The yield on the cashier's order for 10 years fell to 3.632% versus 3.827% on Friday night, yielding to 30 years to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital MUFG
Morgan Stanley Banking House announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, was entering its center, to spend nine billion dollars to raise 21 per cent of its capital. The reception of this report was accompanied by a significant decline in its exchange rate.
A week after revealing their preliminary deal, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at a uniform price of 25.25 dollars, representing a total of three billion dollars.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of the securities as of 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional six billion dollars in acquiring convertible securities that will give it a 10% return and whose exchange price is US$31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation will take place on the basis of an average uniform price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Still, Morgan Stanley shares lost 6.79 per cent, reaching 23.07 dollars around 17.00 Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity on the way to speeding up Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained John Mack, CEO of the U.S. group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to allow him to diverge his activities, but at the same time it is placed under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest aces to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms of the unveiled Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been amended over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"Just a week ago, we thought," Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's chief executive, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation will consist entirely of ordinary shares.
However, in view of the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to keep the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less for Morgan Stanley securities than their book value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in earnings from the stock of about 20%.
The agreement foresees that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares per year if the latter are exchanged for a certain period of time at a price 50 % in excess of the exchange price, i.e. at around 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, a spokeswoman for the group declined to provide specific information about the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a payment ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "significantly" reduced his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, because its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with the debt have risen sharply.
These costs picked up the opposite development on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks, announced after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch buyout that it had collected $15bn, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
To re-establish a republic around the socialism of the 20th century.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Last Sunday, the third appointee submitted a proposal for a new Constitution, following the example of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is accomplished because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
"No" according to these results won 28%, 7 percent of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, he had to get half the vote plus one.
Two polls conducted at the exit of polling stations and a NGO's calculation predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, with them ranging from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa, after all, demanded the victory of his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The institute won all along the line," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the Guaxary Quitaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received a congratulations from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which according to the observation mission of the Organization of States of America (OEA) took place calmly, concerned a text of 444 points building a "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over economics by reserving it to "plan the development" of a country living primarily from oil extraction by foreign companies and from foreign exchange, which is sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, backed by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to exercise two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will run for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the constitution strengthens the principle of free health and education, which the president began to implement in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, thus ending the agreement between Washington and Quito on the use of the Ecuadorian base as the starting point of U.S. drug operations.
Obama wins on points in first televised duel
The first debate between the two candidates at the White House on Friday was followed by a second debate, whose task was to find out which of the pair John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The campaign's commanding tents did not surprise Republicans and Democrats when both declared their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes John McCain's performance, however decent he may have been, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a drop in the polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll released Saturday attributes Obama's five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that the Democrat is the one to win the duel.
Among the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of respondents, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should have the opportunity to confirm his leadership on Thursday using the supposed good performance of his co-candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted," Bill Clinton said over the weekend.
Seventy-something McCain has consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while also highlighting his rival's "naïveté" on issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." was the repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
There have been Republican TV spots in such an attacking spirit since yesterday.
Obama, by contrast, stressed that he represented the future.
He didn't lose his head and turned out to be brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to take the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still misunderstands, while Obama does," the Democratic spot said over the weekend, reproaching the Republican for not sufficiently taking into account the impact of the crisis on the "ordinary American."
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered at a North Carolina election meeting in a heavy rain.
Nor did he utter words like "middle class" or "workers." The financial disintegration clearly favors Obama, whom Americans consider more capable of saving the economy on the edge of the gap.
"Next week could be a decisive twist," influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, likened Obama's "economic foresight" to the one Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democrats' candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as run by George Bush and how it was supported by Senator McCain."
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to cut taxes on 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that the implementation of the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously avoided questions about the 700-billion-dollar (470 billion euro) financial aid plan adopted by Congress last night and which is heavily unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the polls closed in Minsk's main square to protest the irregularity of the election to parliament.
Although no results have been announced yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resignation."
Some admit that they didn't even go to the polls: "What good would it be if they did whatever they wanted with my voice anyway," says one young man.
It does not believe that this regime, which has been affable to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to take a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, which include a visa ban for 40 Belarusian bosses and a freeze on some assets, could be lifted if the election is considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," complained Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leader of the pro-European movement, "because what matters is who counts the votes, and in our country it is executive power.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and draft laws."
The opposition is therefore obliged to participate in the political functioning because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is affected by the crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are in danger of becoming the Protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has watched the conduct of the elections, does not declare the election valid.
He points out that turnout appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What about you, have you noticed that any elections have been held?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot at the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who most suit the regime."
The night silence was again held in the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
19 hostages were freed in Chad
The Egyptian commando took the attack of the kidnapper of eleven tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were alive and healthy on Monday to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, Egyptian commandos liberated them in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 15.30, apparently in good form, on board a special aircraft to the al-Maza military base, closely adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported without the opportunity to comment in the press, aboard helicopters to a hospital in Maadi, the outskirts of Cairo's residential district, to be subjected to medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers," Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garrana said on the airport's taxiway.
Since his captivity on September 19, during a safari in a four-wheel drive vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one borderline director of the Aegyptous agency, the organizer of the safari.
A senior official in Egypt's security forces suggested that 30 members of the special forces, who approached the site on board two helicopters, set off for a runway during the night just before dawn.
"There was a firefight, half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, mentioned the role played by the secret agents and the Italian special forces from Belgrade, where he is currently located.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of the people of our secret services, from the special forces," he said.
He also denied that a ransom was paid.
On the eve of the Sudanese army, the Sudanese army said it had detained a four-wheel-drive vehicle on which the kidnappers were on board, killing six, including a Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The military claimed to have been linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The silent majority of the culture department
The debate about the financing of culture fills the pages of the newspaper with inch-long headlines and is the topic of the current election campaign.
The better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to denounce the poor sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national memorable sites that are dying of hunger?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that he is neglecting his monuments and his historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that would really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government donates three and a half million euros to restore the Chinon Castle in the Loiry Valley?
Our American neighbors write in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all regional organizations, in synergy.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Companies for the History of Quebec, at least 40 000 volunteers associated with 211 societies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy strive to uncover history, preserve a bunch of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a few.
Often, it is these companies who are the watchdogs of our monuments, driven by hopelessness, protest when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers to old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see the grandstands for history and monuments?
Interview - Blood, which is again certain
Hema-Québec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of the founding and its president, dr. Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced, having become one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained the trust of the public, which was seriously shaken after the scandal with contaminated blood in the 80's and 90's.
As is common knowledge, the state blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Due to this drama and the wave of public displeasure, the Canadian government began a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations not to repeat such a disaster.
While Judge Krever delayed submitting the report, some provinces set in motion a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this role was held by Gélinea's committee.
After Gélineau's and Krever's report, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to manage Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society for the supply of all provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec started his activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," Dr. Décary.
"The situation was daunting.
With a continuous effort to increase the safety of blood products and constant work in this field over the years to come, we have regained public confidence," he says, proudly adding that at the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the Quebec population trusted Héma-Québek.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile."
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
"At that time, in Europe, we witnessed the occurrence of many cases of human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," says the woman, who has been leading the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could spread through blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which, if we do not know this and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, it is necessary to take excluding measures.
In April 1999, we therefore turned down blood from people who had been staying in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that the disease was transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that sticking to the principle of prudence made sense.”
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market to detect HIV: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor blood, and not the presence of antibodies on which tests were previously used.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when the first viruses can be detected by our blood techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing about it and without being able to figure it out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusion.
One in 12 million people in the world today is exposed to the risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV.
"In other words, it means that before someone becomes infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will need to be distributed.
Because Héma-Québec distributes 400 000 to 500 000 blood products every year, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission to be discovered through a blood product.
I believe that today we can completely calmly get or prescribe the blood transfusion necessary for recovery," says the head of the leadership of Hém-Québek.
"The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what disease element may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Western Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by stinging insects.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," continues dr. Décaryová and stresses that in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also take into account sufficient supply.
"The needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive treatment for cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also has implications for a network of blood donors, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecians permitted to donation.”
Any healthy person at least 18 years old, corresponding to the admissibility criteria, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not admitted on average because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, for example, and whether they have visited a country where mud fever is rampant are excluded for a year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Weaknesses are very rare.
However, members of the network of donors need to be supplemented in proportion to how they get older and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to persuade people to give blood, especially to keep and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unbridled today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary said.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and freezed before they are stored at Héma-Québek, which also manages the only public bank of blood from the cord of Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, abounds in stem-rich blood, which can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth blood sample from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we assume that we will take over a thousand of them a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," dr. Décary, who describes the blood collection program from the cord as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
The Impact Montreal qualified for the semi-final round of the first USL division during the second and decisive quarter-final match played on the total number of goals in the first division of the USL, thanks to a 3:1 (4:3 victory) over the Sounders of Seattle.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a two-way goalless first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who managed to cope with Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday during the first of two games of the quarter-final, Impact suffered a 2:1 defeat at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a Seattle suburb.
Impact will measure its strength in the semi-final with the Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, the Thunder equalized a 3:1 deficit in the home game and eventually won 4:3, but the Whitecaps advanced to the semi-final round with a total of 5:4 goals.
Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will not be confirmed until today.
Shortly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first offensive trio of Canadien are ready to start the season.
The unit made up of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekanec and Andrej Kosticin last night at Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win the Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists and Kovalev reaped one pass in this fourth victory of the three-color from six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring the only goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian pointed out.
"I need one more game to feel good."
"In the first period, he tried to handle too much," Guy Carbonneau observed.
“I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had some applause.”
Charest bets north
The prime minister has not ruled out calling an early election by the end of the year
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's supplementary elections.
"To push back the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging way at the conclusion of the Congress of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis, without, however, giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind his back in a kind of picture grinder.
On three giant canvases ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, downs, Quebec from the perspective of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, similar to the pre-election period.
At a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out calling an early election in the autumn, although he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The "Plan North" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, a vision of a "new economic space" that includes an agreement with France on labor, a convention between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - northern territory on the 49th parallel - the prime minister has often mentioned in his statements recently, it has never been the subject of a presentation before.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "juvenile with enormous potential," but did not give a deadline, investment amount, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the most, he mentioned several approaches to the points that could be further developed: in particular hydropower plants, forests, but in particular the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The North, according to Charest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This "territory twice the size of France is in our country", "it is in Quebec.
And he's not just with us, but he's in us," he pointed out, as if to show that he's appealing to a certain national founding myth.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the Prime Minister highlighted: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, Quebec Engineering, James's Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after pausing theatrically to view the huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the Prime Minister specified during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all governments so far.
There is one border line on which there has been no convention for a long time, and if a suitable opportunity arises, in the name of the government I will take that position again.”
Otherwise, “it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change,” he said, referring to the north-west crossing, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking up territory is becoming a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pequist MP from Ungavy), have already begun negotiations with about thirty communities.
The work was started by the Inter-Ministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelliter, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The prime minister does not rule out a major meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "a common vision will be set out."
Moreover, the development of the North should be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "commonly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a fluently follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindset to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was, after all, one of the still-shoveling themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a big cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's rise to the party's lead.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to re-christen the Beauharnois headquarters at the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, to Bourass, who created James's bay, our party was able to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
At a press conference, he appealed to another authority, this time a conservative one, on John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, the prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric power plant, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I only say it between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his member base, raising considerable applause.
The same prime minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and undoubtedly not in 2009, he did not rule out the possibility of calling an election in the autumn of this year, which is allowed by law.
However, he stressed that his program is packed, especially by the Federal Council's mission in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress provided the Liberals' chief with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, especially some "efforts to amend the constitution" that have passed very smoothly: the PLQ (the Liberal Party of Quebec) requires particularly recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wishes Québec to appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting who would have veto power in the event of decisions taken in Quebec.
From the opposition side, Plan North was accepted skeptically in its main features.
PQ (Parti Québecois) chief Pauline Marois once again pulled out the Northern Quebec Development Policy, which Landry's government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the government of the Liberals came to power in 2003, it renounced the fulfillment of this policy.
If she could stick to it, "we'd be further along today," Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) of Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in government.
"However, we wish it wasn't just theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, a leader representing Maria Dumonta, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Disgraced Country
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "justice" (o irony) in Harper's cabinet, who took the liberty of saying Louise Arbour last summer that he represented a "shame" for Canada.
This is how to humiliate a woman who has waged an unfailing fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about the Prime Minister’s surroundings and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all participating Western countries, has not transferred back to the homeland of its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account that Omar Khadr was a young adolescent when the actions he was being accused of took place.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of a Geneva convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and especially the Association of Canadian Advocates advocate for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can wait for a fair trial in Canada.
The same government turns a blind eye to torture: little is it that this young man is psychologically destroyed, and this undoubtedly permanently, after so many years of torment.
We do not realize this, but we are just witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," the words that Harper is so bending on and which sounds so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him poorly, to imprison him at the will of the head of the still minority government (as will be the case after 14. October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in the party that proclaims the Virtue, the Law, and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwellian discourse of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter to Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched the prosecution of three authors and a poor little publishing house for insult to honour in order to spark a "transparent public debate" and is demanding six million from them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truthfulness, especially in the case of prosecution for insult to honour, but by law.
Unsurprisingly, Garver completely ignores this fundamental distinction.
Or is it perhaps the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate to bring to a bad anyone who would dare to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada will be forced to spend respectable sums to be ready to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced fight with an army of attorneys backed by the almost bottomless pockets of a mining company.
Moreover, the tactics in these unbalanced struggles often consist in the ruination of the defendants in order to enforce conciliation proceedings, which will be clogged by the mouth of the opposing party and, moreover, scare anyone who would dare to pursue this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view of the matter to the public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada the debate normally lies in the exchange of ideas, and not in the wounds of the baton.
Therefore, mine companies were not enough to open their books, their documentation and establish a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion and has rejected petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate," while also despising the views of the same public?
It seems that this word in the vice president's world refers only to boldly paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrowed conception of this term.
In a democracy, even servers have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the public that supports authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of the mining company.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and assess the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant’s mouth is to be shut (in the context of his prosecution of the “public debate” Barrick, by the way, has just filed an official appeal to the authors of Noir Canada to officially notify them that they should stop using this term...).
Apart from Garver’s surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of research and the search for truth that are essential to every democratic society.
Overall, he denies the right to quote credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that do not appeal to the rich companies of this world without putting ourselves on the face of repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do this?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have formed it if it had followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to a response.
The university environment to which we belong has always been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's over-lawsuit clearly shows that despite what it claims, it has no appetite to have a transparent debate.
It's a loss for the university world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it's time for governments to put in place measures that would limit such a type of wrongful prosecution.
Operations to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest rescue economic plan since the Greater Crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use 700 billion U.S. dollars to slow the financial crisis that has been looming Wall Street for months must still be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms ensuring the repayment of deposited public money, new measures to capture the amount of houses seized due to default, and also the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to executives of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican official at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress and come to an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a Bush administration official.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis just occurring on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"That's a crucial point: if we don't do it, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption of the everyday life of Americans will be huge," Republican Judd Gregg said.
Over the past few hours, negotiations have run to the maximum of fear of the effect of further failures on investors' mood.
The designated time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates for U.S. president were invited to negotiate later, and both expressed their way more for the deal, but without omitting to express their displeasure with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added some measures, particularly to allow owners to maintain their residence, and wage measures for heads of state-saved firms.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate themselves on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the waves of television.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough features I've read [show] that this is something we'll all have to digest and through which we can move forward.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The goal of the 700-billion-dollar plan is to buy back, with taxpayers' money, questionable claims and risky and unsaleable assets of U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis unleashed by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in a cash freeze and disintegration of banks and financial institutions.
The collapse of last week's first draft agreement was due to Republican MPs.
Since the Democrats agreed that for some of the "toxic" assets of companies having difficulties, the government will only guarantee but not buy them, there is a belief that the impasse is over.
In an effort to bring conflicting views in Congress, a measure has been attached setting out that the government will be able to introduce new fees that would help it get its deposit back if, as a result, the program would have to take over losses for five years.
The new plan foresees a deposit of the first amount of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion will be added, if the president deems it necessary.
A deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in the rescued companies, which will pay him dividends in case of profit and which he will be able to sell again when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures for the seizure of real estate associated with the loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits on the amount of the award and compensation paid to executives of the affected firms.
The architects of the plan would like to submit a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, voices were still rising against this project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
"It's perfectly obvious that Washington can't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House of Commons Finance Committee, said in an address to voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, earning money from taxpayers is not the answer.”
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, a congressman's host nicknamed "the Sceptic Committee", presents the matter differently, but there is the same conclusion.
"Four hundred esteemed professors of economics, among them three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us: we are asking Congress not to rush too much and to examine carefully which path to take," he said.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis was a global crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced a partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion USD).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its rival, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion USD) as a result of the crisis of risky loans to buy real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people, among Europe's twenty largest banks and among the top ten insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we get the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And it is precisely the savers and households that can appreciate in these uncertain times.”
On the other side of the English Channel, it seems so far, the British government has begun nationalising another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was supposed to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) were loans to buy real estate.
According to his announcement yesterday, the branches and accounts of the clients of the British bank will be bought by the Spanish bank Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government must nationalise since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - The Death of a Socially Engaged Icon
His beauty with azure's eyes had long represented his trump card, according to others, a weakness.
Has this American actor taken away with a charming smile out of narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity and unfailing talent that were inherent in him also distanced him from the power category that breeds true stars.
What a long runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at 83 at his Connecticut ranch as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less magnificent than Brando, to whom he was similar and for a long time his rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly a more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often breeds beautiful babies.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
No exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it, the whole country in love with self-made man, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in a battle that in the early 1950s studied acting in Yale, then attended New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated triumphs in the theater, television and soon in film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who ranked second in the 24-hour race at Le Mans in 1979, and also a sexual symbol, despite having formed a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it also leave the downsides of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the fuss of their own show-business, which will forever remain mysterious to some extent.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused dizziness to film lovers, while his big roles rival each other on the black screen of memories.
After him, he defiles more than half a century of the ever-changing American seventh art.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams, is re-emerging in memory.
From a less distant past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age by marriages that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans went down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a tortured, violent, memorable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me, Robert Wis, a role for James Dean, taken over after his death, which made Newman a real acquaintance in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, the 1973 Academy Award for Best Picture.
The bitter and vengeful pool player in the amazing Robert Rossen's The Hustler (1961) will play the same character in Martin Scorsese's Color of Money, bringing him the only Oscar in seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering through the ages, it was him.
And again, him.
In his professional career, various epochs compete with each other.
The youngsters know him mainly thanks to the iconic Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy Brothers Coen.
He then completed his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends that left the craft relatively soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood with its tinkles, pomp and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "a lively challenge to underplaying," judging that in his performances he pushed too hard.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as if on a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
But he played the first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, scoundrels and desperate people whose declines and rebellions reflected in his perfect features.
As director Newman has revealed little-known pages of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) in which his wife, Joanne Woodward, played the lead role, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
He dedicated his son, Scott, to his son, whom he lost due to an overdose, in 1984, the film Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sadness.
In a surge of tributes to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly declared: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generousness, love of life, such are the main qualities of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great civil rights campaigner, ecology, independent film, opponent of the decline of Hollywood also leaves.
We were used to seeing his portrait on vials of wine vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, which might have seemed rather tacky to us, although it was a gag at first.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for a difficult childhood.
Newman, rather than being lulled by glory, engaged in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing these sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here.”
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the life path of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the invoice factory Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, 8. October, the trial will begin in criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates.
In addition to other crimes, including the forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are charged with long-term and systematic criminal fraud, resulting in extremely significant damage.
According to prosecutors, they used money raised in public tenders for their own purposes and often documented the fulfillment of tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and self-government - in total of approximately 65 million forints - went partly to the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, in part to the pockets of individuals.
The method, which was also reported by the investigating authority, consisted in the fact that the money raised in public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual consideration and never lived up to the obligations made by the associations.
According to the indictment, a large portion of the invoices were fake.
The forms for these invoices came from the Yoga-Fváros market, the round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The name of which companies the production of invoices was to take place was decided, among other things, on a circular road along the northern shore of Balaton, to which he sent István Lados János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, the first one was supposed to look out for guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he applied for bills for his consumption, according to which invoices submitted in public tenders were then produced, among other things, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively the Municipality of the Capital.
Invoices were mostly issued by István Lados with his companion András Őri, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "study trip," Lados picked out a beer hall.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this hospitality catering facility provided for the ninety-member group of the Biztos Pont association.
However, according to the company’s manager, not so many people would suddenly fit into this facility.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later Együtt and Harmadik Éveredért was teeming with formal and content errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, the fillers of the forms with a rich imagination overdid it even when they put on the documents a company also dedicated to the hospitality industry - Pigal s. r. o., in whose account, according to the information provided to the public prosecutor's office, the documents sounding in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even figure.
The head of the company Győző Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and he was shown invoices, he immediately knew that it was fake documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place."
As he added, apart from the formalities, he did not agree that according to the invoice, they accommodated a hundred people, because they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, food was also mentioned on the invoice, while their restaurant has not been working for a long time.
Zealous invoice manufacturers have not convinced themselves that the Budapest travel agency organizes only foreign trips and on an invoice with payment in cash, which also did not coincide with the company's billing practice, they said foolishly as a service of mediating a trip to Hungary.
Moreover, as the investigation showed, VAT was also stated in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
The four documents issued by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. disagreed, among other things, on the amount of VAT. The company’s activities are not covered by the 25 percent, but by the 15 percent VAT, in addition to which the hotel staff issued only printed invoices, but the invoice produced was written by hand.
In addition, the "publishers" spoiled the invoice, for example, by stating to one company how it became clear thanks to the investigation of the prosecutor's office, as an activity carried out by road transport of goods, which the company originally did not perform on investment advice.
That the invoices are issued to the Együtt and Harmadik Éveredért and the XXI associations. The backing of Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont was false, in addition, also because of formal deviations - an inadequate invoice format and a false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they issued the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s. r. o. z Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time of 2001, when the group from the Fiatal Városért association was eating, precisely why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he had issued the paper.
Invoices were exposed consciously
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation issued accounts for about four million forints for the Harmadik Éveredért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták organization.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab s. r. o. was forced to issue a fictitious account by one of the accused Ludovice Györfi.
Biogate s. r. o. also cooperated with Zuschlag and his associates, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth about five million forints, for which there was no actual economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which, of course, the organizations had already forgotten to state in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies includes those who had ties to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Iván Kubatov was the authorized representative of the Ukrainian executive of Delta Trió s. r. o., engaged in the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, on which, however, the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment funds worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, the Kiskunhala company Cash Investment s. r. o., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, purchased these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was supposed to hand over documents concerning the company in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the associations Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt and Harmadik Éveredért on behalf of the company and himself accepted their consideration.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, the Romanian bricklayers were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, neither of the companies worked, according to the defendant because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies were of his advantage, because at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their instruments of incorporation, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor's office concluded that Kubatov came to 10 percent of the amounts listed on invoices and VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri k. t. to issue fictional invoices, this time for the tender for the Biztos Pont association.
In January 2006, the associations Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals for the public tender of the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They received 500 thousand forints, but did not spend the amounts on the targets set out in the proposals.
In order to make this not clear, TMA submitted five fictional invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found during a search of the house in the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, a portion of the defendants are likely to describe the course of the production of invoices, as they have already done in the prosecution.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant János Zuschlag decides to reveal everything himself.
His statement so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to interpret everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for the payment of a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the Socialists have made a deal with him and Zusi will take it upon himself.
He may have been offended, after all, because his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, namely his placement under house arrest, have remained unheard so far.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have done much more damage that have not yet been paid, are free to walk or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of Trumping: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this familiar - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been uncovered by researchers in the field of neurology and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to fall behind in the eBay auction type competition, so they prefer to pay even too high a price.
Using an experimental auction, the research attempted to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in the actuated auction, using the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the active areas of the brain of the experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could win money, but when playing the auction, the important element of which is to trump the other side, the whole located under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to work intensively during the loss.
This brain region plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system in addition to many other functions.
According to researchers, the price can therefore be explained by trying to avoid a sharp reaction of the striate.
To support their theory, members of the research team from the economists carried out a financial cross-cutting survey.
Under different conditions, three groups were licensed against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the next group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would receive another 15 dollars for the reward.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, but in case of losing, its members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, of everything in the fact that one was emphasized by the win and the other by losing.
However, members of the group playing "against the loss" were willing to go higher than they were in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the neurologists' hypothesis.
"These results cannot be derived from any pre-existing economic theory.
Until now, they had explained phenomena observable at auctions of the joys of victory and avoidance of risk.
It wasn’t until neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the contradiction between the two theories so that we had now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York’s Faculty of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason for this is that the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
Their symptoms contain many similarities, symptomatic is inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the causes of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the cause of the disease, spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E to the digestive tract (for example, infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
In any case, travelers should protect themselves by vaccination against the A and B virus, there is no vaccine against the C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of the infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, the urge to vomit.
Then, jaundice is formed on the skin and whites of the eye, the stools are lightened and the urine darkens. Treatment can take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten people infected is treated medically.
Also, hepatitis C can have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of those infected do not even know about their disease, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells insidiously, and so the first symptoms occur in many cases in 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention, regular depistage, is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more often than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the projected global number of individuals infected with the Chronic Hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can prove already routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his general practitioner if he notices any symptom of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, preventing contagiousness and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized worldwide by organizations representing the sick worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
The Benelux governments will nationally part of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is the first in Europe to run into trouble due to the spreading effect of the U.S. mortgage market crisis, by partial nationalization: the three countries will support the money and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, amounting to 11.2 billion euros.
This weekend was agreed at the highest level by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to be seen as a precedent in the context of the international financial market crisis, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made on this issue could be considered as precedents.
In the sense of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will redeem almost half (49 percent) of the bank's assets.
The bank will with absolute certainty sell part of its capital participations, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis bank shares began to fall sharply last week, with serious signs of crisis already appearing at the institute in the second half of the week.
But analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let go bankrupt.
The firm's securities fell just 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the group's total market capital is around 14 billion euros, but according to business leaders, this is unrealistic.
Indeed, the company’s management blames the fall in Fortis’ stock on the overseas market, related to the adoption of a US $700 billion package plan.
By Monday, the stock had already risen slightly.
On Friday, new CEO Filip Dierckx was appointed to head the bank.
The money institution was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has yet come forward.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Panic has not yet broken out among the bank's clients, and the branches have not been taken by attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also purchased several leasing companies.
Those who believe in God do not hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, the belief in God works as a certain analgesic that could have eased the deaths of already Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how human faith in the god affects the perception of pain, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electric shocks, while all watched a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique detailing the human brain, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
The research is the first in a series of research, in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university participate in in addition to academics.
The test was exactly the case by attaching a sparking instrument to the left hand of the experimental subject, which was giving off electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary dating from the 17th century and the Lady with the prism of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain state of piety among the faithful, while they chose the Da Vinci image because it was not very different from the first and gave a calming impression.
The test subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and during this time received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts, while separately watching the image with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics said that at the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as if they were "taken care of" and "calmed down, peace filled them."
Watching the image with a religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than when Leonardo was in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strongly impressive image even in atheists, only the right photo needs to be found.
"We would have to find a picture that they will perceive very positively, from the position of mother or father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the pain of believers if they had been shown a Madonna by Leonard or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would a look at a quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you share
On his 10th birthday, Google can declare that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations they go to and what they care about.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
However, when it comes to skeptics, making a parallel with the Orwellian dark vision, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal information about users, which is necessary to allow Google’s founders to stick to their original intention, which was, “Let’s organize all the information in the world!”
According to Google, the company is still at the beginning of its world-class work after ten years of world-class work.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what work would be suitable for me?" - but the software will not be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until they know enough about users.
Not all Internet users know that during the Internet search, the search words and what IP address were searched for and which pages the interested parties moved to after the search are accurately captured.
With Personalized Search launched two years ago, for example, users can keep their surf history, look back at what they were looking for and what they clicked on, which in the long run generates findings adapted much more directly to them - the same logic will be based on the Recommendations service, through which the system will offer us products and services based on previously mentioned and retained preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - ask users who are afraid when looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is more threatening, the counter-reaction does not provoke the awareness of guilt in the Internet users, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases they can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most famous example of recent times was probably a coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of paedophiles from the community pages of Orkut, established through it.
However, Internet users who are worried about personal rights could still relax in May when the firm, hand in hand with the EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully won nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained, citing reinforcements years ago adopted by the Child Protection Act, yet it failed to get lists of searched items of individual users, respectively, complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
Google’s view is quite contradictory: it is whipped up by those who fear providing their personal information because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be exposed by them to start using Google services, exposed to harm, and speak out against it with a revolt that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wild offshoot, grouping around enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, see in it a new generation of big companies, "the corporation that's now snooping," unlike its rival Microsoft, considered because of Windows to be the conqueror of the world, however much both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require an identification code from its users and does not ask for money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as a much more accessible, youthful, "cololar" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, it may also be due to the fact that the geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which brought with it just one of the most inclined keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing more than cooperation, that we deliberately leave behind and use the communication channels at our disposal, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show up.
The average young person can keep a profile on several community pages from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording his/her music, all of which can then be connected to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition to which he can automatically appear his latest photo galleries, which he saves on Flick.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which it shines: in the morning, looking at the flood of photos of mutual friends, it easily finds out who her scary friend spent the evening with, or the company can fire his worker just because he recounts his sincere opinion of the top management on his blog: one thing is certain, the concept of private life today has completely re-evaluated itself.
He who lives an online life consists of what he shows of himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly has the option (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google’s search system, but deliberately leaves no trace).
For example, a significant number of people do not register on a community site on purpose so that they cannot be found. Online applications of Google from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which do not build the highest quality profile.
Public opinion does not secretly expect when Google will show teeth.
With a current value of 156 billion dollars, the company is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising space threatens the investment of advertising agencies, and services implemented at a constantly accelerating pace seriously make life difficult not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software designers.
But critical observers also find counterpoints that give a disturbing impression: the top management, for example, completely rejected the protests of employees after it raised the fee for a company nursery, the free daily meals of employees were too expensive, according to the company management, all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google still bent before the Chinese government in 2006 and, in the sense of their agreement, filtered out every finding that is contrary to good interest.
One of the internal rules of the company is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years may be affected by the world in new places: while some believe that Google’s project focused on scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking on such a dimension that the company will soon have to deal with the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of its health system, in which we can build a complete health profile
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material even for subsequent generations of science fiction writers, the famous novella Cory Doctorow "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences the future, in which one can easily approach a person with the help of Google data.
The two-time killer from Ózd was helped to remove the traces of two juveniles
Two juveniles were interviewed by police in the case of the double murder in Ozd, according to reasonable suspicions helped with the removal of traces of this crime, a spokesman for the High Police Directorate of the Borsod County said on Tuesday.
Persons have confessed to the activities from which they were suspected and are currently accused of aiding and abetting a crime.
Both juveniles, according to MTI information two girls, are being prosecuted at large.
Aiding a crime is punishable by imprisonment for a period of up to 5 years.
A suspect in the double murder in Ózd, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of a crime pre-planned multiple murders for self-interested reasons.
During the investigation, it emerged that the 23-year-old young man owed the 53-year-old man a larger sum.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he lured his creditor last Wednesday to one establishment in Ózd, where he killed a man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man prepared in advance for the crime, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the scene.
Both the weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a hundred percent share of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is due to the fact that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all those interested, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by the experts on the stock markets at 5-10 billion.
Under the shareholders' agreement, around 90 percent of the shares could be sold off.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In his Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading newspapers are already commemorating "the second 9/11."
We can thank the US president for the global financial disaster, he raises the accusations of the Roman La Repubblica. The president has not even been able to line up his own party in support of that hastily patted bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which resembled billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second 9/11.
Also, part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
In the opinion of the daily El Mundo, the world economy has brought to the brink of collapse the lack of political leadership there.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is constantly growing, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
While Bush’s plan was not perfect, after a vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to solve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism is underway.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the Geneva-based daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline to the staggering money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from collapse.
However, if other banks collapse like the doughnuts of the domino, then neither the funds nor the further improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move through their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the post-standing money institutions received more than 100 billion euros, according to the Vienna-based Der Standard, according to which fears that, like the Americans, will have to reach deep into their pockets in the interest of solving the crisis, European taxpayers will also have to be increasingly real.
The European Union has not yet seriously addressed the crisis that is rolling through the old continent like tsunamis.
"Rescuers" do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they fixed out in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Smart car imitates bumblebee flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitation of obstacle detectors occurring in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprise project, presented at the Japanese trade fair CEATEC, was inspired by engineers from Nissan bumblebees. It was about how to build a new generation of systems to prevent collisions.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has constructed a BIO23C biomimetic robotic control system, a robotic minicar equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which actually closely resembles our safety protective packaging," Kazuhiro Doi, brand general manager for technology PR and research and development, explained at the exhibition.
An important role is played by the folded eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eye, engineers reached for the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 metres in front of the BR23C in the 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms into a collision prevention operation.
The obstacle is captured in a fraction of a second, then the robotized car begins to imitate the bee's movements and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent a collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this puncture manoeuvre takes place in an absolutely instinctive way.
"If this were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety protective packaging, inside which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, in the case of a robotic car, only the possibility of rotating motion, acceleration and deceleration was applied.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, instinctive, intelligent response is important, not the ability to process, much less data storage.
This mechanism must be processed and responded to only a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need for him to store them and respond using the intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so he constantly uses only memory of the size of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing a technology to immediately avoid, which Nissan estimates could reach mass-produced cars within a decade.
Another possibility of application may be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding the path of the lying obstacles, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
The damned dear child already has a name
The 700-billion-dollar economic rescue package, which is to be broken down in several instalments and aimed at buying back low-quality loans to banks, is already in writing.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations that didn't end until Saturday after midnight U.S. Eastern time, congressional leaders reached an agreement in a days-long debate over a 700-billion-dollar rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, who said only that the agreement was left.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said: “The program will work and be effective, but further action needs to be taken.”
The written version of the package was released before the Asian markets opened on Sunday at 8 a.m. Washington time (on Monday at two o'clock in the morning of Central European time), but it did not cause any special rise on the exchanges.
The House of Representatives will vote on the draft legal standard hearing the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which is to be established on Monday.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, after which reports of the deal were also welcomed to the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made at night and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
Moreover, the program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal, which was supposed to be about spending a total of 700 billion dollars on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of £700 billion in the first round, by using 250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to decide the matter on Monday, and the Treasury will buy mortgage-backed securities for them, which are rated poor quality, and the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will depend on the president’s decision.
The program will be controlled by a special corps, of which the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank will also be a member.
Spending the second half of 700 billion dollars will depend on the next congressional decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply combined tactics within the meaning of the Act: it can simultaneously buy back low-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other "poisonous" loans.
The purchase can also take place directly within the auctions, the ministry's competent officials said.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance will guarantee them a guarantee for funds representing a reason for concern, for which companies will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to spend up to 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent demands of the U.S. financial system, whether it will be a large-scale purchase of the wrong funds, their insurance, or the prevention of systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major money institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
Bank chiefs, who have run into trouble and are waiting to help the state, can count on the government to reduce their severance pay - which is simply called "golden parachute" in overseas slang.
The limitation of their payouts will occur only in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys as part of the auction, a tax premium will be imposed on the golden parachutes if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene in the interest of ensuring that the money for management is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the existing contracts for gold parachutes will not change, the restriction only applies to new contracts, which is intended to be another stimulus to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in U.S. history where the statutory restrictions on CEOs' remuneration will be in effect," House of Representatives' House of Representatives Committee Chairman Barney Frank said in a statement.
In addition, the state in the banks participating in the program will have the right to acquire a share, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the rescued bank get on their feet, they can even profit from this transaction.
The plan includes that in the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress setting out how taxpayer-expected losses from the financial sector can be returned.
There have also been voices on both sides expressing doubts in the context of the plan.
"That's not what the American people asked us to do, because this won't protect taxpayer dollars," California congressman Darrell Issa said.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said those responsible for Wall Street's collapse were urged to pass the provision.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 due to the previous month, compared to August 2007 by 12.9 percent, the Central Statistical Office reported.
Export sales prices in the industry were up 1.1 percent compared with July 2008, down 3.9 percent year-on-year.
Production prices in the industry were higher by 0.7 percent as a cause of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month, rising by 3.2 percent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry rose only minimally, by 0.1 percent, given the previous month.
Also, domestic sales prices in the manufacturing industries increased slightly, by 0.1 percent, compared to July.
The biggest price increase took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 percent), mainly due to a month-on-month increase in prices in the production of bag and saddlery products by 4.6 percent and footwear production by 2.5 percent, respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 percent).
The price reduction occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other manufacturing sectors, we measured a price increase of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sectors, which have a lot of weight in domestic sales of industry, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the ongoing effect of the officially determined increase in gas prices running from 1. July.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales in the various sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices increased the most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, it was possible to observe a 13.2 percent increase in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which have a decisive weight.
Prices have been reduced in textile and textile products (2.5 percent) and the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3 percent).
In other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry have risen by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water sector outperformed prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In terms of division by sector focus, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) in the tangible asset production sectors was reflected in domestic sales in August.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices rose by 0.3 percent, in the energy of processing and further processing sectors, prices were unchanged due to the previous month.
The biggest price increases, given the same month of the previous year, could be observed in the energy of the processing and processing sectors (16.8 percent) in August 2008.
In the consumer goods industries, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent, while in the case of tangible assets, we measured a price decrease of 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, falling by 3.9 percent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent in one month relative to the euro, and by 7.1 percent relative to the dollar, rising 7.5 percent relative to the euro in August 2007 and 15.9 percent relative to the dollar.
No visa to the United States next year?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is a great hope that the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free travel agreement will come into force around January 12, the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "it now depends almost only on whether an electronic system of permitting travel or controls is built in a timely manner".
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not include a permit to enter, but tourists will have to be registered before leaving.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy continues negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross to the Star of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of a bank bailout package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major U.S. parties, on Sunday consistently assured the government's 700-billion-dollar bailout package of their support, but there are also politicians demanding the Treasury secretary's resignation.
After a several-day marathon of meetings between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early Sunday morning: a basic deal was reached on the bank bailout package.
The financial package, which aims to remelt the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are equally branded more appropriate of both candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, at the same time as the economic issues came to the fore, Obama regained some advantage and dissolved McCain's lead, which he secured after the Republican convention nominated by Sarah Palin to the post of vice president.
Obama expressed hope on Sunday at a campaign rally in Detroit that the 700-billion-dollar package bill will be swiftly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passages on consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We have to act now, responsibly (...) to your places, to the savings, to the whole industry, to the stability of the whole economy there is a danger," he said in front of the 35-thousand-strong crowd.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, "It's going to be a little bit of a liability to everyone (...) but doing nothing is just not possible."
As the Republican senator put it, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission supervising the Treasury secretary and limiting severance pay for the senior officials he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no significant role in the negotiations, but he himself was in daily contact with the secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill perhaps as early as Monday.
Overview of the German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-and-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses in his article "The Bavarian Revolution eats up his fathers" the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, the CSU's erosion began a long time before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
The Christian socialists have been restoring Bavaria for decades - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The alternation of the period is a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, and thus of Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Saturday the trial ended, which could be assumed almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Already a decade ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, still in the time of Stoiber's often-recalled period.
The cause is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong at pace. However, secularization, educational outcomes, the settlement of Germans from the east and the north in the emerging regions of Bavaria could not have been without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with the growth of possibilities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more confident, more critical, willful.
It is also clear that in recent weeks the CSU has been the most distant classical civic classes; people in the free profession, tradesmen, individuals with graduation and with higher education.
By doing so, CSU support has already shrunk below 40 percent.

The Conservative Vienna Journal in its article titled "Who, with whom? The leaders of the parties are restrained on the issues of the coalition" devotes the confused internal political situation arising as a result of the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the interference of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ seems to be open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to agree on a coalition.
The election is over, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders did not get much of a peek into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wished to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some federal states and in social partnership exists.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, was left open by Faymann.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was overruled in any case.
A repeat of this direction is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offerings.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open in the party, these issues must definitely be discussed inside the ÖVP.
Chairman BZÖ Jörg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent a red-and-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility," Haider said in a statement.
Jaróková: It is necessary to break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
The European Equality Summit, hosted by France this year, the current presiding state of the European Union, has begun in Paris today.
Lívia Járóková, a member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of professional debate in her message addressed to the plenary, has turned her attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The top conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The debates were among the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civic associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs during the recruitment of labour, Romani people are pushed out of the European labour market primarily due to their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and only a small proportion of them can achieve a higher level of education due to poor quality of primary education."
Járóková further stressed that education as a basic human right has a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MP, it is necessary to confirm the awareness of these contexts in the widest circles - among both Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes, they contribute to the national budget.
"Roma are entitled to their citizenship of the European Union the need to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their low-quality and separate education," emphasized Lívia Járóková.
According to the Member, the cohesion of the European Union is needed with an emphasis on the objective and negotiations in order to speed up the processes of desegregation of schools immediately, and this is primarily important for the correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to provide Romani children with opportunities given by democratic space so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková demanded.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set at the level of Europe and individual Member States.
Fox in the chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people's data on drug purchases, often dismiss the possibility of entering into an insurance contract with a bidder.
Data protection experts fear the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that binds the use of drug prescription data in any case to the person's permission.
It has to be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the chicken coop to the fox," Richard Dick, author of the drug prescribing program, said in a statement.
Insurance companies make premiums and amounts paid in the event of insurance claims dependent on the health status of the interested parties, and if the risk is assessed as too large, they will not even take out insurance with it.
They had previously sent the person concerned for medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick devised a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer easily finds out from the pharmacies what medications the person has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself will infer what disease he suffers from and what his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large number of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it refers to the fact that he has virtually uncontrollably high levels of blood fats, which immediately puts him in the category with a higher risk.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some determine the risk coefficient at the same time, so the insurance company has almost no work left except for paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that many drugs can also be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, usable against migraine or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
From the point of view of commercial insurance companies, these represent a significant risk-enhancing factor, while the first mentioned difficulties do not.
In order to request and process data, special companies have been created who, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, will ask the patient for permission.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, even though they have not punished them for their negligence so far.
Some companies have recently been processing the results of laboratory examinations that associate with the data about the medications used, thanks to which they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health condition of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, at the same time the control of their use will become increasingly difficult.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give authorities the power to control even businesses specializing in providing data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, he developed his programme in such a way that the assignment of the data is tied to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the consent in question can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the chickens are, after all, somewhat dependent on the fox goodwill.
CSU: temporary mercy
The fate of the outgoing duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided in late October
Despite the shameful electoral debacle, the debate on personal issues has so far been adjourned by the top Bavarian CSU.
Party leader Erwin Huber and provincial prime minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is when this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized duo have been told that they will not cling to their posts with all their strength.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and base, who, because of the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of her career, the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but her strength was only 43.4 percent.
The CSU has been a "self-ruler" in Bavaria producing 18 percent of German GDP for 46 years.
While the Conservatives in the southern Länder, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, continue to have a high position, they will be forced to coalition in any case in the future.
One of the first signs of the reorganization within the party is that a member of the narrow intelligence team that will begin probing negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, respectively with the right-wing group Free voters, will also be the vice-chairman and federal agriculture minister Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, whose appearance against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the coup, then with an ambitious municipal politician, took a ruthlessly short trial.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, the active role will also fall on Stoiber, who until now has spun threads from the background, the former provincial prime minister and former chairman of the CSU called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a few sarcastic remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in its national success in 2005, somehow puts it on its feet.
According to Merkel, who found it hard to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on Berlin's grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the Social Democrats' crisis continues.
The SPD achieved the weakest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko:oposition - 110:0
Not a single opposition MP made it to the Belarusian parliament in Sunday's election.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the well-being and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by the illegalities that occurred during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10 million country has been lacking in opposition for a good ten years, the opposition, grouped under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections, seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had had his presidential term resumed for the fourth time in the 2006 elections and the fourth time, would "allow" several members to appear in parliament.
The ODS has also abandoned the previously considered boycott.
In the background of opposition expectations, Belarus was increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took credit to mitigate the impact of Russia's ever-increasing import of natural gas and also contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, which owns pipelines passing through the country, got into Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political system, the entry-level politicians, and other politicians are not granted entry-level permits.
The release had previously pointed out that the OSCE had placed emphasis on positive shifts in the evaluation of the election campaign, and not on shortcomings - for example, on banning candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
Monday's ESCE flash report, however, already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates basically could not appear in the press, especially that the opposition could not be present counting the votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there is a sense of improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow in smaller confrontations, when he continues to refuse to recognize from Georgia the breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, has considered the two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain so, even though "the power has become afraid to let a single member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament."
Looking at the results of the opposition, he does not plan protest actions, rather he tries to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, the distribution is hindered by local authorities, but I still see that more and more people support the change, even among the older people," Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not consider the right or the most officially supported class of pensioners.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security of the 'inducing silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, Sergei Lebedev, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words, but actions," so the absence of opposition is nothing more than a testament to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
The Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
Since the European Union and India are mutual leading trading partners, this topic has been dominated by, among other, largely global issues, also on the agenda of the ninth meeting at the highest level.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, primarily for cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak into international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to find a common denominator on the issue of supporting New Delhi’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at last night’s ninth summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current president of the Union, or European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and senior foreign policy officer Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the turnover of trade within five years, or rise to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods has risen from 25 to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
Twenty-six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been legally aligned in the sign of this, so air travel has also been given the green light in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy has promised that negotiations will be expedited.
The aim is to balance the balance sheet, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi figures to be ninth among EU partners.
The summit also paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively terrorism - both sides in all its forms condemned and called for an urgent convening of the UN conference.
They also urged the end of the Doha trade negotiations round, although both have a large share of his previous failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, which it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India has also agreed, as has the need to conclude a global agreement at next year’s climate conference and reduce greenhouse-effect gases by fifty percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will fly to the French capital today, where he is preparing to close a deal on the peaceful use of atomic energy during a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that French companies will receive a mandate to build India's twenty billion euro nuclear reactors.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
A large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair awaits more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries on this edition, who will take up 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as a guest of honor.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural celebrations in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on a 264-sqm exhibition space.
It will be followed by a meeting with the press in the Buchmesse Room Structures in Hall 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, tendencies and perspectives in terms of the state of the publishing house in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is still decreasing, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a revolving door has been put in place upon the arrival and departure of staff.
But from now on, this new measure against cunning people will start to work, against those who inject themselves and then go for coffee during working hours.
The news against the sloths was introduced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Maur Masi.
"The revolving door - Brunetta says - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more attendance and more services" the minister specifies.
"A new period of responsibility and transparency will now open.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace will complete the introduction in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of a revolving door is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from the staff, the secretary-general assures: "This was a common approach with the workers and the cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and no more croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "there's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will eventually announce that within three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60 thousand more people a year at work."
And it will add that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its payroll dynamics - the minister explains - have doubled in the last 8-10 years relative to the private sector and are far higher than the inflation percentage."
Meanwhile, thousands of public servants have come together to reject Brunett's decree standards in line with a Codacons-backed application.
"While the Minister for Public Administration will today present figures regarding a lower absence from work due to illness - writes the Consumer Protection Association - the nation of 'diligent sloths' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree."
The Tara will be protested primarily against the exclusion of sickness benefits, which depend on the activity; the extension of the time in which the patient can be checked, within what time range the control visits will be carried out, and against the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work injuries, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day, 2,500 accidents at work occur in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
The Inail values confirm that we have about 1,200 deaths from accidents at work in 2007.
These values indicate the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main reasons for death and causes almost double the deaths compared to murders.
To re-arouse the attention of institutions, social and information on this dramatic issue, Anmil is today celebrating the 58th national day of victims of accidents at work in all Italian regions, set for the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data extended by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirms the important issue of occupational safety," confirms the Republic's President, Giorgio Napolitano, in a report sent to President Anmila, the National Association for the Crippled and Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his vivid admiration for the constant joint efforts for job security, for the protection of injured workers, for assistance to the families of the victims and for the participation of public opinion."
“Naturally, an outraged ‘enough’ has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of the tragedies that, by their extent, cause a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion, but the daily reality offers us again dramatic cases, even repeating in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
Major initiatives in the field of education are becoming particularly important in order to give clearer awareness to young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social seriousness, to apply and to improve legislative norms.
The president of the chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed on his part how the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary termination of this state."
“As for the data on work-related injuries, they appear to be showing some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths from a work-related injury is alarming anyway,” said President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't want this "reduction effort" to lead to less attention, because just as the focus stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that there is still too little to stop the problem of injuries in general, and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion, to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, right from school age."
"There is still a need for further effort - he added - in terms of communication and participation of public opinion.
But above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli eventually declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of compensation right foreseen for work victims and the "displacement of supportive care" that the system has been receiving in recent years."
"The goal is therefore to return the guarantee of insurance to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who hurt himself must not depend on spontaneity or gifting from time to time by the legislator."
Mp3 players accused, expose hearing to risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music devices as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a European Commission announcement published today, which in one official report enlarged in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Committee on the Science of Health Risks, which has recently arisen and been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
“From this scientific view – we read in the notes – it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music devices for at least five years, more than an hour a week and keep the device at high volume, risk permanent loss of hearing ability.”
“I worry that such a large number of young people who use frequently portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - continuing to lead - show a clear risk and need to be reacted quickly.
The most important thing is that we have to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to become completely efficient and to keep up with the new technology."
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this issue due to the high use of portable music instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists - concluded by the executive officer of the Eu - confirm the need to worry and now the European Commission will examine, together with other members and parties, which have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be put in place and thus better protect children and young people from exposed to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices."
There is currently a safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by seeking solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee of the Eu states that users of portable music devices, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours per week, exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a longer period of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices, and their amount can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will let the Commission run free for the future of the capital
Today we will start, we will close in March, we will have sums in June.
Such is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Spa.
At six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the commission will draw up handbooks for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councillor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas - Alemanno -- He wants to emphasize -- It will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political arbitrators, by which the Giunta e Municipal Council remains.
It is not about any exchange of functions, but merely an effort to have a place to process a large project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved because this institution must have an exact time limit.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present a strategic plan and use the work carried out by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome.”
To those who accuse the Commission of unnecessary reasons, given that its opinion will not be binding, Alemanno will say: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, as will the proposals of the Commission of Attali, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics splashes on everyday problems and on the urgency that occurs from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasise that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary enterprise nor a bluff: it is completely free, the Roman citizens will not cost or the euro and will serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence that the capital has."
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor motionless, in order to allow our city an authentic rise at the level it badly needs and to think with a united spirit about its future."
The future, which, is specified by the mayor of Rome "will not limit himself only to the current municipal borders, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and his legal status the capital, but "also include the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? The first anti-American president. Now you know why
One well-known U.S. president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as he did today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama are mounting just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on the website: "This guy is full of ambition.
But Obama has an insolence: he thinks he will get to the highest post of the nation, which had two governors and five black senators!”
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; everyone says Obama will win and with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act by the heart and not by the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the bowels of the south of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the electoral booth, we know well who the American patriot will give his vote to.
There is one side of the American mentality that remained high until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll take care of it ourselves, who to tick, whether Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain to the success of the black candidate.
But despite all this consideration for Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his term? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent it home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to pack up.
And yet, Iraq has become Bush's weakness for most.
Whoever takes the place of Georgie W will have to do a huge task.
The economic collapse of the U.S. has also been felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers. And many blame the internet, the "killer" of prints.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say they had less concern about credibility.
It doesn't feel isolated like it once was.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a ruined economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put together newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists surveyed, this is a problem that needs to be solved, if we do not want traditional journalism to fundamentally change as understood by the general public.
The American journalist permeates clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors are convinced that journalism is going down the wrong path on a national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
A larger publishing house is making its way to the Internet, which many view as a "killer" of prints.
The "economic pressure" that journalists point out has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists admitted to resorting to technology in the hope that they would "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms – that is, leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the figure drops to 23%.
This has something to do for someone with "work security."
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are at national level of 47%.
As for the journalists, they're moving at 30%.
When it comes to "certain work" involving staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on a daily basis.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In such a huge nation as Usa, with three hundred million residents and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and so the question is to take or leave.
Managers almost always receive huge salaries, and the editor can earn even ten thousand dollars a month out of payment of pensions and insurance.
As for the holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until reaching fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It's just a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to dismiss the submission of the real estate businessman Daniel Coppola, who asked to be allowed to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the counter-offer in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he received his release last week from house arrest, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His attorneys, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, have asked that a real estate entrepreneur be able to change his whereabouts from a rural town to a capital.
However, according to the court, this transfer (against which he referred to pm) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon manifested itself a few days ago, when the Chamber of Representatives voted against a rescue plan to provide 700 billion dollars to the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving economics.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is torn apart by the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, milder, accommodating to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to" those of Washington» and to the world of finance, strong especially in states in the middle and south.
The soul, which was arrogantly manifested by the vote I spoke about at the beginning..
But this just quoted thing is just an example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not just in the United States, but in the whole of the West, and perhaps not just here.
Both in the Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which have been tightening in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactualization, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the double category of the State-power in relation to a certain renationalization of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis for the bank of financial institutions, which, of course, have strong bonds abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, are included in the greatest extent.
Which created a political problem at the same time for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families, which are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically world-class, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be substantially out of the question or that it has nothing much to add: the European Union, which is as always divided between different interests and different state strategies, has given obvious evidence, and which cannot decide on one common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the division of funds: the moment we get into distress, only the states have economic resources, a lot of financial resources, so that they are able to try to put everything in order.
And it also owns the necessary means and authorisations to use it: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances, by which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose to a similar degree.
Moreover, this new emphase, which the crisis puts on a state-national element, is in complete harmony with the ever-increasing importance that attempts to attribute the latest economic advances to one factor closely related to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of sita, increasingly sophisticated technology, imaterial, while we were convinced that the worldwide finances were already destined to rule the world, out of nowhere we realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little immaterial things as water, grain, diesel.
All things that would be said can be transported from one place to the ground to another, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to the bounded area, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more cards up his sleeve than who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without grain, without diesel and without water.
I get to the second novelty, but it predicts a break.
Those who speak of territory, of the state, of the government, inevitably speak of politics, that is, leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be being created.
On the one hand, the realization that there is objectively a need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who could take up the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit to existing leadership, especially economic leadership, which has proved equally unsuitable and full of dark places.
And together something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: discredit, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence that seeks to control the entire ruling class in increasingly Western countries.
It seems to be increasingly widespread in the broad masses of the population of the belief than that their actions be the same as those of the still popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed their time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply nourishes one branch from the underground, but the strong movement for the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political arrangement manifests itself in the sudden electoral" resistance" or in the unexpected changes of collective sentiment in recent and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the fall of Labour in the UK, to the revolt of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps with the victory of the US congressmen against Bush).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have ever greater problems to understand, that is, to represent, which, not from today, is being created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is re-enhancing, growing, potentially overly vivid.
Before this, it would be an exaggeration to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But we certainly can't say that it means having your eyes properly open.
Super glue to walk on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists have managed to keep a hundred-kilogram body glued to the vertical wall using a sticker of just 2.5 square centimetres.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some University researchers in Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials that already exist, which use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf pipes.
«The base of the glue can be imagined as a series of pipes laid as an orderly pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers were inspired by the legs of the gecon, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure perfect adherence.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles and at the same time "just peels off the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering.
WALKING ON THE WALLS? -"This material could be useful as a makeshift adhesive» will supply Liming Dai.
Maybe walking on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers are thinking of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
No super heroes yet.
ALSO, the University of Berkley, California, is dedicated to researching a new adhesive.
In one article in the journal American Chemical Society, California researchers presented a micro-fiber-shaped adhesive as hair that cleans itself from dust by moving across the surface to still maintain perfect snugness.
Medication: never with juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed primarily in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes the amplification or decrease in effectiveness with serious consequences on health.
To highlight the risks of juices both ready-made and fresh in combination with the ingestion of certain drugs, David Bailey, a professor at the 263th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, raises a new alarm: just one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, to annul their beneficial effects, and to put patients at risk.
Grep juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to a toxic level the effects of certain antiarithmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolitics, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
PHANKS IN RISK– This was reported by the Italian Medical Agency itself in a bulletin two years ago and roused doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink in the event of taking medication, such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress the drugs.
A long list of effects dampened by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately announced to various international and national pharmacy agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative prescriptions of the medications you get and if you come across something unclear, do not get mad, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» emphasized the expert for the Ansa agency.
Nobel for Economics Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Kenyan who teaches at the University of Priceton and who is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics in terms of foreign, economic and political action by the Bush administration.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, in the days of the crash of Enron, Krugman predicted in one commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would, in terms of implications on the history of the United States, be far more important than the first.
A prediction that provoked a few controversies and which had been reproached for years, but which turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and shocked at the speed of collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public interest, Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great importance", but also a popularizer who has a "very aggressive style, especially critical against the excesses of the Bush Liberalist administration».
Open Office, here we have the third release of the package"anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package that tends to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the better-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is showing to the general public with various innovations: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window will be added to another, far more substantial, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard version of ISO.
The focus is also on collaborating with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as what allows to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer the PDF folder to the graphical design model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create PDF hybrids documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet or word program.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements inside application programs: in excell it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in a text program, each co-worker is assigned one color to comment to make it clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to transfer some Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and should resume a definitive result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it has been added to the English version, which is located on the mirror from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent to the workplace on request.
And if the topic of freeness can be a draw to expand in households, the Open Office package is a lot of bets on the business area, and can already count on various projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And there are also offers of training, consultations and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that tends to replace Excel; Impress for presentations similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, eventually, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach five million downloads, and considering that to date we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this projected number can be surpassed.
Also, Kohl's results are positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winner of the best climber's T-shirt.
The report was quoted by the L'Equipe newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer to play positive for Cera, the third-generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohla's blood samples fall into those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analyses confirm the positivity on Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the stipulated two years of disqualification.
The report on the positivity of Kohl to the third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced to the Associated Press that it had already informed the Austrian government authorities of the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastr and American Cadel Evansema, also winning the polka dot T-shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY A RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only in the last house turned into a priority target of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
Does it turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? So he asks in one long article by the New York Times, which devoted this article to a debate on the subject of racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, because he stole a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines the "paradox of the north": northern areas are simultaneously the ones where "more integration and more work" registers, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant mindset in the country and the strongest support of the Northern League."
To confirm the rising tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation required by Lega, which seeks to hamper immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of Italy's changing climate.
The tendency highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism."
Steve Fossett's plane found, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the desert in Nevada, was found.
The wreckage was discovered on one plateau at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes region of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, dispersed the doubts that still remained: "The plane was found, we sent the team there and now we have the confidence that this is exactly what Steve Fossett flew in on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said that human remains were not found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the debris was detected, an investigation team that eventually identified the plane: it is exactly the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, to a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some of Fossett's personal items were found by one pair near their dwelling in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash money and one jacket.
The search for Fossetto was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world trip in an air balloon: a two-week flight alone.
Three years later, he circled the world on a plane and without landing.
Among his many records are also a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, above the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, an advertisement you don't expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last birth of Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a whirlwind of news to this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional processing, there will be unexpected and unconventional communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk and which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17. October.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will also start an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan's main business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision, and with the help of special glasses, which will be distributed near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
After that, using the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different moments in all its little things to then reassemble in a single image.
With this advertisement, Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical area of car communication.
Will he be able to attract future customers in this way? We'll see.
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls Italy are now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following Nazionale azzurra for years and has never, in truth, ever caused exaggerated problems.
She never even met her opponent's fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders are from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste e Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-color flags on which the cities of the origin of the participants appear: on Saturday night, they removed them so that they would not be recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found true Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc gave Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all in the name, that is, easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasle, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had earlier offences from the stadium were denied a ticket and a match banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the messages coming from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to fans who have been arrested or those identified during the riots.
The International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a single stadium.
To luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, more than one hundred and fifty will be added to it.
"We must put out this fire right away and not justify those who behave in this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "well-open eyes, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Leč".
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, which can count on even one part of Aise, it is a secret service that cares about problems in stadiums.
"Choral Leader-Leader and Stretched Arms during Mameli's anthem? It's not a crime in Bulgaria..."
Such is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way) who has been the director of the Viminal Osservatorium for a few weeks (he won a place that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a bursar in Trieste, where the core of Ultras Italia's supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course that the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is an embarrassment.
"I'm not a sociologist - he adds the Osservator leader - the crimes are attributed to the country in which they happened.
So far, this group has remained within the limits, now we will take a hard look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistle at Mameli’s anthem: it’s not even a crime, but if you don’t mind, it’s rudeness.
Students by victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the unions for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
“The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that entire layers of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to endure – explains the head of the office for studies Sunia, Laura Mariani – in this city, a great demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has sparked the process of price increases, which has also been spread to residents.”
In most cases, rent offers contain several offences: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, without limited rent, associated subleases.
For Sunji, an exceptional intervention is needed that could regulate prices thanks to the tax review.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, about 450 euros is needed for a single bed, for a single room is paid from the minimum price of 650 (the Bande Nere zone) through the mean value of 800 (the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zones) to the maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, it is necessary to 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in doubles.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will only save if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for a single room of the Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, 300/450 euros is needed for a bed, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have greater impacts on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is rent for students from outside the European Union, one other anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of roughly 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students, compared to Italian ones.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, cities are disturbing the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is like a blind man, like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in major Italian urban centres, but also rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multi-halls in the suburbs, and the subsequent demise of monosals in central urban zones, is one of the events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the hallmarks of true cultural crime.
Often historical places full of memories disappear," is as if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of the journey and a lot of emotions», feels the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won the Tornator Oscar and the Grand Jury Prize in Cannes twenty years ago, and who told the poetry of one village cinema and sadness because of the way of life that the cinema probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the past five years, the door of 316 cinemas of traditional tip has closed, and the highest bill has been paid primarily by halls in the most important cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Torin, about 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna, with a loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multi-halls: 195 more canvases in Lombardy in the last five years, by 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
«Italian procedure has evolved unrationally» claims Paolo Protti, President of Anec,"it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the already existing ones will survive, because when one cinema closes in the city, not all of its visitors are willing to move to the multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about a lack of subsidy for the fund for the benefit of the operators: the previous national debt is roughly 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a disgrace that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed to support the sector».
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which has decided to find a way out by signing a protocule between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historic centers and suburbs.
Among the planned standards are steps of tax breaks in favour of operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted transport zone and have special prices to stop and in some car parks.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to stand against the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more challenging.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a theme that was forever important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to establish the "New Paradiso Cinema" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale Street, where I shared so many emotions that I do not have to look at the inscriptions blackened with dust, I turn to the other side».
The connection between politics and the mafia group 'ndrangheta, mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the election of the city office according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The accusations that the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria have brought against the mayor and deputy mayor Gioi Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarn Carla Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the mafia organization, are tough.
In the handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson a lawyer, the chief's namesake, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to a payment of 10 million euros.
"They have ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," prosecutors write, when two local administrations expressed a willingness to pay consultations to attorney Piromalli.
"This would allow the Mafia group to officially enter the municipal authorities and facilitate the already enormous possibilities of control and management of public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "there are a lot of secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld in his county: "There are areas in which the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where collusion is inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'ndrangheta, the heroes who are still immaculate.'
The imprisonment from this morning follows the imprisonment of July last year, by which police showed that the mafia group Piromalli had been given the final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the City Council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was the then supposed connection between organized crime and the local administration - local politicians were stripped of their positions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the moment of dissolution was elected head of the right-hand centre coalition after a narrower election in May.
He shouted over the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called for the responsibility of then-Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, and accused him of orchestrating everything for political reasons, but judges in the prison order signed this morning explain that the mafia group has even come so far as to request a change to the A3 motorway project.
From further interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors write, came out "a willingness to move the demands of the entrepreneur, representatives of some larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt the election of public administration to the interests of the mafia group."
When energy is born of waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an infinite deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is now beginning to be discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyes of colossuses such as Chevron, which are now trying to lay their hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went sideways. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in the price of oil have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London declared in 2007 that around 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea wave movements.
this amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
There are also currents and tides.
Giants are attacking.
The company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
“Chevron studies ocean energy technology – a spokesperson for a company linked to the U.S. oil colossus, in the Wall Street Journal’s economic daily newspaper – and they think about the possibility of working with us.”
The collaboration we are considering relates to obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is required to start a marine energy project in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush came up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. follows the trail of marine energy. From New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, show an increasing interest, according to observers.
The technology that needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in the early days because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not appear to be causing major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are connected to each other.
The strength of the waves, which moves with buoys up and down, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies power to the generator.
The energy reaches the shore by undersea cables.
For now, there are four facilities of this type in the project phase that are waiting only for federal approval and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing energy for the shopping centre and parking lot by using six marine turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water during the tide and tide causes the turbines to rotate, which feed the generator with this revolving motion.
Verdant has said that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations because of the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
A special interest at this point deserves the potential of inflows, they say at the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although this is an incoherent factor, the tides are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It was in the energy of inflows and tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, and other coastal states, had already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and predicted investments of up to 35 million dollars for 2009.
