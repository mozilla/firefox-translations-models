Petr Cech: Transfer at the last minute?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
The next chance will come in winter.
Petr Cech, currently a substitute goalkeeper for Chelsea, is now not sitting over a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the Smíchov NH Hotel, speaks with Czech journalists and prepares with the Czech team for the game general with the Americans and subsequently also for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualifying against the Netherlands.
In the Chelsea goal, Thibaut Courtois is given priority in the new Premier League season, and for the first time in a decade at the London club, he has been substituted.
Some time ago, there was speculation that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup in the opening season in a duel with Atletico and failed to make it to the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about Paris SG's interest.
He made two wins and two draws in the French league season, shooting St. Etienne 5:0.
The most realistically pushing the bot club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and broke up with Lille at 1:1 at the weekend.
Reports jumped on the tabloid English websites today that the Czech might want to at Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Chek's last-minute departure from Chelsea is unlikely.
Skybet put a 4:1 odds on him.
Peter, is it possible that you will change the jersey in the remaining few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything a hundred percent in football.
Maybe during the day there will be an offer that can't be refused.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(Laughs) "Well, I don't know what such an offer, what it can't be rejected, actually looks like.
It would have to come down to a consensus of all parties First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's position whether the club would address the eventual offer or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new location?
So I didn't think about it.
But there are a lot of players in that situation today, everyone is somewhere at the national team reunions and certainly a lot of transfers will still be closed today.
So somehow feasible would certainly be.
How many clubs are on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing for leaving?
The situation when I didn't catch in the first three games of the new season is new to me after fifteen years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in the Chelsea goalkeeper's position and it is up to the coach who he chooses, what decisions he will make over the next few weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision-making?
I take into account all the factors.
The important thing for me is, of course, the sporting aspect, but I also look at it from the personal side, to which the need of the family of course belongs.
Is it possible that you would be catching for another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never concern me.
But anything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

Police in Karrata arrest 20-year-old youth after motorcycle chase
The motorbike was stopped after a 125 km/h 125 km/h was hurtling through the zone with a maximum speed of 70 km/h and drove into the bush to escape the police officers.
In the morning, traffic police tried to stop a blue motorbike near the side of the road when they noticed that 125 km/h was driving when leaving the gas station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then turned into the bush, so officers lost sight of him.
The motorbike and the person matching the driver's description were then spotted at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgara.
Karrath police have accused the 20-year-old of disobeying a call to stop and careless proceedings.
He will stand trial in Karrata on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized for three months.
George Webster charged with rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will be brought to justice on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed on the charges during a hearing at Glasgow Supreme Court.
He reportedly had a 7. June 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, to rape a woman.
According to the claim, Webster attacked her while "she was not conscious, sleeping and was not in a state to give her consent."
Furthermore, Webster is being prosecuted for the rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set a trial date for November 17 at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Restoring the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights at the same time
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law designed to protect organizing in unions as civil law.
"By how the unions operate, there are jobs for the middle class," says Ellison, the Democratic senator behind Minnesota, who is co-chair of the Congressional Committee.
That's why I'm so proud to present the law, together with the role model of the occasional rights of John Lewis, empowering employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to defend themselves against discrimination in unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stop the anti-union forces
Adjusting the Labor Relations Act to allow all employees facing discrimination, if they want to join unions, sue in civil court - and assess compensation or damages - is a proper and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other petitioners in the law are putting forward is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the union fighting that took place in recent years - Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labor rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the country in one breath championed democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja was replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in the formation of the new Japan, included the language in them and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to gather, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans were aware that employees would need to be organized and promoted in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly says: “The right to create associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
Arrangements that will restrict this right or seek to damage it will be revoked. Measures to fulfil such a purpose are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Human Rights Commission, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the petitioners and Roosevelt included the guarantee that “everyone has the right to create and enter and enter trade unions in the protection of their interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with firms and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and assert themselves in a free and open society.
As Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the power of the nation, but have expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry, and lifted production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and we should not.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have lifted America and made it a true promise of democracy.
A judge temporarily blocked a law that could have shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked Louisiana's law, which, according to attorneys, would likely close all five clinics conducting abortions in the state.
The regulation, enacted by the signature of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to come into force on September 1, would require doctors performing abortions to have the right to accept a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's order means that doctors can temporarily pursue legal abortions and, in the meantime, must obtain this permit.
"The proposing party will be able to lawfully operate and, in the meantime, obtain a permit," federal judge John deGravelles's ruling reads.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month so the judge can issue a more permanent resolution regarding the law.
Activists for abortion rights welcomed the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, and said it would give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from a sneaky law designed to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who has sought to block the law on behalf of three of the five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applies to doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, and also apply for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have passed similar laws, with the courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of Texas law that would shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Women's abortion rights campaigners, together with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this permit puts medically-necessary requirements on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion opposed the measures aiming to protect women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said only one abortion doctor has a permit in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for fear of his safety, the group said.
Louisiana authorities said in response that they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while awaiting processing of a rights request.
Because of the late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in the countryside
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of a tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than in their counterparts in the city.
The researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35 per cent lived five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs can slow lung and ovarian cancer
The women's researchers followed up over seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were affected by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rates occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that factors may be late diagnosis and poor treatment availability.
"The disease is best treated by gyneconcologists, who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of distance medical services designed to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen the transportation service that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are healing far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of the geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, young mom Elisha Neave of the city of Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to a HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary decline of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that when today’s young generation of consumers reaches the “main age group of gardeners,” garden centers will lose up to ten million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent housing spend an average of 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own.
As other factors threatening an industry that earns an estimated five billion pounds a year, he cites an increase in the number of people living in very urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as a parking area and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of house-owned homes has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, one household accounts for the lowest expenditure on horticultural products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said housing in sublease or lack of space does not mean people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's chief horticultural adviser, said: "For tenants, growing plants in pots is very popular - when they move, they can take the plants with them."
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales for this year thanks to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin, at the reunion of his youth organization, which most of all reminds me of Hitler Youth, he rattled me with atomic weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that his views were not stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of the fascist state.
Great nations have one thing in common, and that is that both tense nationalism can control them and that the inferiority complex can transform them into imperialist appetites.
Time passes differently in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of war for domination over Europe was long gone, in the east, on the contrary, it thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and it is necessary to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, and then followed an explosion of nationalism unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the completely identical cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the liquidation of inconvenient political opponents, the discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, is quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and certainly a large part of the Russians probably miss the time when Russia ruled half of the world and the other part was shaking in front of them.
It was probably the Western politicians who caused it themselves, perhaps little Vladimir was patted on the shoulders, maybe they did not invite him where he wanted to go and maybe they began to underestimate him and he simply acted like a typical Russian man.
He made an order at home, pretending he didn't even want to go anywhere and was grinding knives at home.
Now he's decided to regain his lost positions.
It starts slowly, it has time.
The leader is probably for life, so where would he rush.
He trampled on the Caucasus, now he's trampling on the Ukrainians, then the Dwarves of the Baltics are next.
They've been pinching a Russian bear in a fur coat for a long time.
This will certainly be noticed by China, which is getting too high and is definitely taking a look at the far east.
And the Germans are also pretty upset about how good they are and we gave them at 45 so on their butts.
How about doing a new Novorosiya in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base and there are a lot of ours and how they are oppressed there and the dača wanted to demolish any of them.
After all, our veterans will remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, vot, their prime minister, Gospodin Sobotka, is so soft, he can peel like an onion and I'll eat their whole EU.
That's how it would play for the big Russia to jump out.
It is necessary to remind them where their place is.
And as detonators, we'll use our fellow tribesmen who live in their territory.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and when they say they're oppressed, they just oppress them, and we don't leave that, we protect them.
And again the Russian will rule, for what else is he born.
After all, Europe is only good as a preposition on which proud Ivan can dance a Cossack.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over spy report
Turkey's foreign minister has called the country's highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain the report on U.S. and British espionage activity in Turkey.
The deputy prime minister, Bulent, said U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish civil servants discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that according to documents provided by a former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and declared that all major states are watching each other.
The earlier report, according to which the German intelligence agency also targeted Ankara, provoked a more outrageous reaction from the Turkish government.
The Game of Thrones series has unveiled more tricks of the fourth season
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the tricks of the fourth row were created.
The most visible are computer modifications of the serial environment and the mass scene, when a cluster of soldiers becomes a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Director of Police in Magaluf accused of corruption
Complainants on Friday presented evidence to the office of the Mallorcan state prosecutor about extortion by police officers and civil servants of the town hall in the Calvia self-governing area.
The director of police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested after charges brought by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector Jose Antonio Navarro was taken into pre-trial detention after several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightlife venues in Magaluf were located, had been charged with corruption.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday the complainants presented the prosecutor of the Mallorcan corruption-fighting office with evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the town hall in the municipal area of Calvia.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish state police over a link to corruption charges and, along with Navarro, will be interviewed by a judge.
Spain's national newspaper ABC quoted disgruntled nightlife owners as saying public officials' favours have serious implications for their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about surviving,” one businessman said in court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made it to the main pages of magazines around the world after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist who gave oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour appeared on YouTube.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to supervise drunks and rioters in the ranks of participants in holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours of bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the event was provided with oral sex, was forced to close for a year and together with the organizers of the tour of the bars by Carnage paid a fine of 55 000 euros (73 000 dollars).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including a fashionable wave known as "balconing," in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and thunderstorms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide Airport
Spring brought an ice surprise to the south of South Australia, coming with heavy rain and fierce winds that seriously hit Adelaide airports.
Another 5 mm of rainfall in the city should fall until nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night to Sunday.
The last rain was presented together with a few short showers associated with thunderstorms and gusts of wind, which began before eight o'clock in the evening and brought almost 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After several early doses of spring came after the winter of last week, temperatures in the city dropped again on Monday to just 15.8 degrees Celsius.
The stormy weather is believed to have contributed to Virgin Airlines' delayed arrival from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land after 19:30, but was hit by a change in speed or wind direction over short distances and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport were reaching speeds of about 50 km/h on the ground at the time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to drop the second landing and finally landed at about 20:40.
The delay in the aircraft subsequently caused delays to additional flights including Emirates' flight from Dubai and Qantas' flight from Sydney.
According to the forecast, temperatures in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16°C on Tuesday and one or two showers may appear.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, rockets and mortars were attacking their homes. But schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory reels from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in the south of Israel marked by attacks, but signs of fighting are still evident.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, nursery staff hit by a rocket have removed the remains from the wall after shrapnel and are slowly awaiting the return of children.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a resident of the Saad kibbutz and an English teacher at a local school.
A lot of children from this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her eleven-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that “it’s a little strange” to go to school again.
"We've had some difficult times and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
The Kibbutz, located near the border with Gaza, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to residents.
Until the ceasefire last week ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and made their way to safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza in which a Palestinian mortar missile killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The education minister said about a dozen families had still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged children to study diligently, adding, "We will provide you with education and safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an unlimited peace.
While the cease-fire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not solve key issues such as Hamas's demand to end Israel's Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates of Palestinians and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, even though it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortar missiles during fighting on Israeli cities primarily in the south of the country.
The Israeli military has carried out more than 5 000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people have been hidden in a hundred U.N. schools that have turned into makeshift shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still staying in hiding, and because of ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be opened so that we can complete our education just like the Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a thirteen-year-old boy from school in Gaza's largest city.
Willow at the reunion: I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafata suffers from temperature
The Czech national football team met today before noon in Prague before Wednesday's preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualifier against the Netherlands.
Of the twenty-three-man cadre, Spartan striker David Lafata, who is troubled by the temperature, is in trouble.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players and David probably still has a little bit of problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it's two or three days, or if he's fit tomorrow, that'll be seen according to his health, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has some pain, but it's not like they can't train or participate in a match on Wednesday with the USA," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba was the last player to be the Spartan midfielder Lukáš Vácha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, other midfielders were also considered.
I decided on the basis that Lukáš is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision-making was very difficult, but I stand by it," Vrba said to Vách.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latta
It is not excluded that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
At the weekend, for example, Liberec's Josef Šural, who gave a hat-trick, flashed a great performance.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form recently.
We'll see how David Lafata is doing.
In case he won't be able to be available on Wednesday, I'm not saying I can't dominate any of the players who were intrigued in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon, the team will receive training at Strahov, on Tuesday a classic pre-match training session before a duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and will be followed by an autograph session.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team will be aiming for a first-round victory under Vrba.
He has played two draws in the previous three preparatory matches and lost once.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is on the agenda on September 9 from 20:45.
Pešice goes to the Netherlands to Italy
Vrba is happy to have more time for training, unlike previous meetings.
There's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we may not have had so much time for before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing for the Netherlands in the best possible way," Vrba said.
The Dutch will present themselves in Italy on Thursday before the game in Prague and the duel will be personally watched by former interim national team coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that's from the game.
But it won't be just about him, we'll have the game and the game and we'll talk about it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," said Vrba to the bronze medalists from the recent world championships.
According to high-profile statistics, the prices of apartments in the winter have increased the most in the last seven years.
According to the housing index in the Australian capital, RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase climbed to 10.9%, more than double in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said he was leading Sydney and Melbourne in the market.
RP Data figures show Sydney's housing prices rose 16.1% last year, while Melbourne prices rose 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price rises of an average of between five and six per cent.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was placed, which was damaged by state-ordered spending reductions and where prices rose only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that when spring has now begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "true test" for the market.
"Due to the persistent high rate of auction sell-offs, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, the housing value is likely to increase even further over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never told me “I love you”
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
They had a cooler relationship with his father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the factory.
Henry is rehearsing the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melody is optimistic.
Henry, however, had to deal with a few unpleasant memories from his childhood.
After his mother's death, Henry went through "thorough" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice: "Stop with the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, were already adults - went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I've never spoken to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Recently, Henry visited the foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than his father's time, he looked into what life must have been for him.
There's a little more light in there today, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always climbed into the bath and just lay there, then he could hear him slowly starting to sing to himself because he was washing the foundry out of himself.
When I walked by, I realized that he had been doing these years to support the family, and I began to value him more.
Even so, Henry spent his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn’t hug anyone, he didn’t say, “I love you.”
It wasn’t until my mom was sick and dying that we started to think, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
His daughter Billie, who he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop with “I love you”?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
With French, whom he's been married to for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn is good.
Why shouldn't we be friends with Dawn?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes were starting to show, the doctor told me, “You have to make a radical change.”
So I started going to a big fitness center and I also had to stick to a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
No one wants to eat carrots.
The change in the direction of Henry's career is perhaps reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After receiving his acclaim from the critic for his Othello, he plunged into the theater.
This was followed by a comedy full of mistakes and the Plot of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ spotted him on stage as he parodies someone, and wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “I’ve been the only black imitator/comedian on TV for a long time.”
He was learning on the fly.
Besides the fact that the public had to notice me, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to invent working jokes, be a star and perform on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed up as black, Henry eventually performed with his comedy for five years.
My family was already uncomfortable about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big stages and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "years and years-recognized major product of British television" but was also "a grotesque parody of blacks."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who also mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s, among others, it was known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
He was taken another decade by commercials, documentaries, TV series and roles in movies, but after the broadcast of his series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: "So what are you going to do now, Len, it kind of looks like you're stuck in one place, or you're kind of out of the way."
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't learn him properly at school and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should give it a try."
Don't get into it when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented twenty lines for the documentary from Othell's closing speech, and he was already involved.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gave me courage.
"It's about that. It's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out something about it.
So the rehearsal was hard, and I've read the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which didn't happen.
He soon began playing in a Comedy Full of Errors.
I was suddenly at the National Theatre. I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, “You’ve changed.”
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for entertaining the audience.
“The sound in my head said, ‘Before the computer fixes, you have to entertain them for ten minutes.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, “Hm, thank God.”
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Ploty at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Fences was a challenge.
The panic is pretty good, he adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a divine sign that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he says it in a sounding voice.
So I'm staying with that.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the rehearsal room.
Henry, however, remains the brain of a comedian - all the time our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances, when he enters and performs from the role of an imitator.
I've decided not to do stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I'd say.
When you're always looking for something, you can get to a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy about it like I used to.
I asked if he would ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director helping to give outlines the beginning, middle and end of the journey - I don't think I'd ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent employees
Kenya began biometrically registering all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to the government's statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will stop receiving a paycheck.
The government believes thousands of people are receiving a salary even after they have left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to prevent corruption in the state administration.
An audit conducted this year showed that the state was losing at least one million dollars (700 000 pounds) per month on the payouts of non-existent employees and in the further abuse of official authority.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts even after the employee's death or after the employee leaves the state administration, a BBC reporter from the capital, Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, said.
All civil servants must arrive at identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, according to a government statement.
He further says that anyone who fails to appear without a sufficient apology will be removed from the payroll.
"By designating real public service employees, this measure will significantly contribute to its economic performance and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested over 'conspiracy' against government
Local media report that a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiring against the government."
The police office has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, fourteen high-ranking officials were among those detained.
Some of them were embraced into a December corruption investigation that targeted government officials including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and phone eavesdropping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time, the prime minister) called their actions part of the actions of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk has taken his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told reporters present that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1.
There is peace not in all of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk, attended by Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated so that children put on embroidered shirts, bring balloons and give flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for tough times
It carries with it clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience from the front lines.
She began her career at the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years. She resigned when her younger colleague took office at the parent company of Pearson's.
It is said that her severance pay was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, a former director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's job as a cup with poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and intricate entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inwards to the top layer of the BBC's own leadership hierarchy, but also out to the public's voice in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for thorough reform.
But which director would risk coming to a company complex like a Chinese dynasty, dismantling it and depriving himself of his job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and how its status is being revised.
As the circle of competition expands and the new technology challenges old certainties, the immediate negotiations on concession fees for the BBC carry a major danger.
For a modest amount of 145.50 pounds a year, the British public is buying a stake in something that is certainly the world's largest media venture.
The BBC tells a good story: that its production is 96% of households, each costing only 40 pence a day.
Moreover, the BBC's popularity is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters versus 31 per cent a decade ago.
The models of using the BBC services have changed: Today, the headlines appear on my mobile phone and I can watch the shows I missed on the iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to be a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs a wonderful director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he did not approve the offensive tweet
A tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, which was released Sunday, included an offensive picture of a Democratic prosecutor initiating Perry's criminal charges of abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and another one was posted on Perry's account, which had distanced itself from the previous one.
A tweet that was not authorized left my account.
"I don't agree with the tweet and I downloaded it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants did not respond to the news with questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it's unclear who is actually responsible for managing it.
The previous tweet was posted by an unflattering, humorous picture of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry rejected the disbursement of funds for her office, which Perry, a possible presidential candidate in the 2016 election, brought in front of a grand jury in Austin this month.
The caption said in a tweet: "I don't always drive with three times the level of alcohol in my blood than the permitted limit... but when I do, I'm going to sue Governor Perry for calling me to be responsible for it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not led by Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, the special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the accusations a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked a judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because the use of laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry interrupted the payment of $7.5 million from the state's public interest defense fund, which is headquartered in Travis County and prosecuted by Texas corruption, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection sparked a formal complaint from a left-leaning group of civic activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes even made famous.
After finishing fifth in his party's committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be out by now, a tweet with his own photo of himself running near the lake, and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to "normal"
One of London's most prominent development companies has warned that the housing market has "returned" to a normal level of activity in south-east England.
Living in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices, and widespread fears of a credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the developer for discerning clients of Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned from a top point in 2013 to a normal level of transactions." He adds that it provides a "stable environment for functioning."
The London housing market was doing well during the downturn because buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to the Land Registry's data, prices in the city jumped 18.5% last year alone, far surpassing the average of 6.7% in England and all of Wales.
Average sales prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to 423,000 pounds at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening pound, London's property has not been so attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "housing tax" that politicians came up with before next May's parliamentary elections.
London-based real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter lending rules, would also slow the market's growth rate in both property and price sales during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the amount of mortgages approved for the month of July, suggesting the housing market is calming.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its forecast of 2015 price rises to 3% based on house prices already starting to fall.
The volume of transactions, meanwhile, has been reduced by a quarter each year in London's most expensive neighbourhoods, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to real estate agency WA Ellis.
Still, housing demand in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley as it increased cash for forward sales to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location remained the same and that made forward sales sustained."
In June, the firm announced that it had sold 3 742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, nearly a third more than before the 2007 crisis peaked.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, revenue by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday, ahead of Pidgley's annual meeting, he said it was anticipated that Berkeley's annual returns would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be 450 million pounds.
Berkeley shares stopped at 23.96 pounds on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
A hacker posted photos of Jennifer Lawrence's naked on the internet
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence leaked to the internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of photos of another hundred aspiring actresses.
A spokesman for the "Hunger Games" movie star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and had criticized the hacker for "obvious violations of privacy."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who releases the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker obtained the photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image sharing server, thanks to a gap in Apple's Internet storage system, iCloud. The alleged list of photos of the hacked victims, according to BuzzFeed, includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many photos are authentic, but the star of "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who view the photos my husband and I took in private years ago are happy with yourself," Winstead tweeted.
Victoria Justice, known from the card series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied the photos were genuine. She said on Twitter: "These alleged nude photos of me are a FAK, folks."
Better to cut it off even more in the heyday. *intentional pun*.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that pop star spokesman Ariana Grande had denied the alleged photos were genuine.
An extraordinary excerpt from Howard Jacobson's praised new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually decomposing like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complicated, violent, isolated, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He acknowledged it in annoyance.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was an incipient love complexion that more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and a fickle heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
To the south she came with an older companion who Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited property in a damp but beautiful valley called, conveniently, the Valley of Paradise.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the tubs, slugs had sledged on their windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge cabbage heads.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, terrifying and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A narrower selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning in to the public station, which supplied the county with comforting music and comforting news, when the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of the old song of a long-forgotten black comedian, whom he liked to listen to with his blinds.
You have too big legs.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They were not forbidden - indeed forbidden was nothing - they were simply not played.
They helped them get to the ten-deed, as did the word desuetudo itself.
Folk taste has accomplished what regulations and outlawed positions can never do, and just as people choose memoirs in terms of books, in which the poor man becomes a rich man, cookbooks and love novels, so in music are selected ballads.
Kavern let himself be pulled down by the bottom and began to play the imaginary piano and the corse, comical voice sang the serenade to Ailline's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was still a kid.
His father told him he had played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth when you started with the word that started, it cost you your penny.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't funny even now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Even jazz, although not directly outlawed, was played.
The improvisation went out of fashion.
There was only room in life for one “if.”
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she was going to end up.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was a humor expressed by a song.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was a black man.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when popular singers weren't black.
Also without laws or coercion.
A free society is one in which each part of it agrees with gratitude with gratitude to those who were fortunately saved by chance.
The people of African-Caribban origin were suited to temperament and constitution for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent, as if nature-gifted for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family will be without a functioning phone.
The Poles who stayed were the plumbers, the Greeks who stayed, washed the dishes.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while what happened, if IT HAPPENED - they were afraid of being accused of putting them on the fire, actually afraid that the fire would digest them next time - they opened restaurants where labneh was sold and hookahs smoked, did not draw attention to themselves and inaction slowly.
Everyone according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how music could have been made out of the dirty words that Kavern had just sung.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really rude," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big feet.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
There was no word to escape from behind the soundproofed leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"He seemed funny," he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief, overshadowing Kevern's view.
There was nothing but a jumble of her raven hair in the whole wide world.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
Not the feet.
Maybe a little ankles...
You're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have told her “I love you,” but it was too early for that.
"I'm attracted to your thick ankles right now," he tried.
I'm kind of creepy.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to be able to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Perhaps his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was a deliberately cruel Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from the couch, dropped the radio, and spilled the unfinished wine.
The bless wine, so it wasn't the drink to blame.
She seemed to be shaking like palm leaves in a storm in her excitement.
"I'm sickly attracted to you for being a jerk," she said.
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both because of her unkind words and because of the fear she had in her eyes the moment she stood against him.
She thought she was going to be hit?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the foundations it was the same as here.
The same wide and icy oceans were shattering over them.
The same mad men, after what had HAPPENED, even more petty and sullen than their ancestors, smugglers and spoilers, wandered angrily from pub to pub, ready to lay a hand on any woman who would dare to reject them or laugh at them.
A jerk?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First to cuddle her - to cuddle became the most common term for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: an antidote to the faint ballads of love that the radio spewed - first they cuddled her, then one of hers murdered.
In Kevern's view, excessive refinement because cuddling was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a nonverbally hint at leaving.
He rose from the couch like an old man.
She felt annoyed, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave - as if watching him from a floor-up window - a man he had caught up with what he had caused himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart tightened because of him and all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders drooping, ashamed, defeated, all the combativeness left him - why did she feel that she knew this look well, even though she could not remember a single moment, until today, that she would have seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, herself again, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic thirty-two-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statutory Public Mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the persistence of mild and moderate acts of violence in areas of the country where his mitigation or direct stop was most expected if enough money and energy were spent on his removal.
"A lot has been done, and a lot has yet to be done," she wrote, "in order to calm the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the crowded, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the tips of church towers rising over the hedges, a touch of human kindness has rarely appeared."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas, old brutality is held as stubbornly as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that new and offensive intolerance is emerging at home, in the workplace, in the workplace, roads and even on sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you tend to have too much style," her supervisor said.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I need to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again objected to her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I'm not asking," Rabinowitz said at last, "that I would have anything against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unbiased companies.
But a kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is utterly acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment in the way you have demonstrated.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced towards the Church - things you call "cruel" and "brutal" could also be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and energy.
Still dealing with what HAPPENED, if IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, he was preparing a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
Behind his head, a pink-shaped recommendation flashed on the light board, which Offnow had been broadcasting to the world for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, converse, explain, make a deal, apologize.
Speaking is better than keeping quiet, the sung word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied softly, when she was sure her supervisor was done, "and I'm not saying the wound hasn't healed the way we tell ourselves it's healed.
My concern, above all, is that if we do not point it out in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingertips.
This was meant to indicate infinite patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you describe the steps that your grandparents may have taken and may not have taken, as mistakes.
You also go too far in talking about venting their “anger” and “distrust” on “others.”
I should not remind anyone if we were you, that in understanding the past and in protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them.”
There was no “we” and there were no “they.”
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"Which, if we are honest with each other," Esme said, "we are no one to blame.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no blame that could be blamed on anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the remedy was appropriate and possible.
But what's the point of the past other than to learn from it -
The past exists to forget it.
If there's anything I can add to that -
Luther Rabinowitz unplugged his fingertips.
"I'll take your message into account," he said, dismissing it.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the pavement in a way that passers-by described as "brutal and furious."
Coincidences happen.
The army of the Lesothian Kingdom says it does not plan any coup - the prime minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Lesoth kingdom have denied organising a coup for the purpose of overthrowing the government, saying they have acted against police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the military has surrounded its official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maser.
After he declared that they were threatening him with death, the prime minister and his family went to neighboring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but an army response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the command of the Defense Forces of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several reports from the information service that there are several groups in the ranks of the police that plan to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to wreak havoc in the country," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has seized government power through force, the actions of the Lesoth defense forces appear to bear the marks of a coup d'état," he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Lesoth said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he was the target of an attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
There have been tensions in Lesoth since Thabane suspended the session of parliament over internal disputes since June.
He said that despite the opposite claims, his actions do not undermine the government.
Production in the euro area is at a thirteen-month low
Production growth slowed to a 13-month low in August, according to a closely watched survey in the eurozone.
The eurozone's final purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell from June's 51.8 in August to 50.7.
A number greater than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have fallen and factories have been damaged by rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to tackle the eurozone's delayed recovery, as well as the threat of inflation deflation stagnant at 0.3%.
There was speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have hinted this week that he was considering quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to the one the UK and US have approached during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty have on manufacturers is becoming increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The manufacturing PMI of Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
Concern is over France, Italy has again switched from the expansion of the stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands have disappeared is also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to add oil to the fire to analysts expecting the implementation of additional monetary or tax stimulus.
One positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the purchasing managers' production review for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: Producers in the eurozone currently have a very complex life because the increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the ever-intensive conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has proven to have affected the trade - primarily consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, mainly the costly ones.
He stated that it appears as "even more likely" that the ECB will eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of Hell of the Beslan survivors: Ten years since the horrors of the occupied school, children still suffer
Ten years ago, a thousand people were held hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
During the suffering, which lasted three days and which shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children
We returned to Beslan to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocities
Exactly ten years after the horrific occupation of the school in Beslan, in which 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, last night the surviving heroes warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance over the tragedy united East and West, which in this disastrous misfortune led to negotiations and the future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity.
We have found wonderful young people who have resisted misfortune, even though the memory of the hell caused by terrorists will live on in them.
What is their biggest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them were dying - may be over.
Girl trying to climb back into ruined school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitry Beliakov trying only in her underwear to climb back into a bombed-out school gym after a bomb exploded in her.
Confused, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that both were dead, but they actually survived.
“Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and got back to find my mother.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she had already fully recovered, but yesterday she said: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have another operation.
There were bits of shards left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it hasn't destroyed it," she said, determinedly.
“It just happened to me and that can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate of Djera Gapoev's class were killed there.
When we were little, we played together and imagined going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about captivity, but memories fade a little every year.
I'm glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we're very grateful for the help we've been given from Britain and other countries.
When I look on the Internet at my picture of me climbing through the school window, I think that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped by the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children start school at the age of seven) and survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother, Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, "Mommy told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, running and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed the child by the hand and they ran a shower of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: "Damir told me his mother was dead."
He said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara staggered to freedom and lay in hospital with her leg injured and, on the contrary, thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran inside and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World) where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are already fading.
I remember right after that I threw away all my playing guns.
Today, however, I can play computer games that shoot, and I have no problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and who didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or that they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose anything I wanted in a toy store, and how I drove a convertible.
But now he is worried about places like Ukraine, where he and his friends suffered because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
“I feel terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such horror,” says Damir, who took part in volunteering at the monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work in the police office one day, and I hope they'll hire me to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara 48, says: "They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack. There were no children screaming and running around, and the silence lasted for months.
He vividly remembers his trip with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's appetite for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir was shooting at them with a water pistol and they were running and playing with him.
And that was only a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in those ten years.
Now the war is in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been and will still be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or while doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a nice and quiet boy, he's not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates and from time to time he goes to the gym and lights candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lying down on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying like that for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing out all his pistols or other weapons to play with. Damir's 17 today, he's taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was sure for several hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, there were pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy didn't have this hell chance to survive.
“I remember shouting ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and he ran away.
So our lives go further than others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Solace: Survivors of Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack to the right of Grigory today
When he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was engraved in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days," she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's getting harder to think about and talk about.
It won't be a day before we can remember the tragedy.
It doesn't feel like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: A photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I learned he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of a crying Grigory in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at the picture, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I get it, but I also think that because of the picture, people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says, “The important thing is that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we will ever know the truth.
Such tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
They're investigating the boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
This world is expecting something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget a little, he needs decades.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I was thinking about my friends and the classmates they killed.
That's why, when September 1 approaches, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in a gym as he sits next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It feels like it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries he sustained during the attack, he couldn't.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
Now I'm older and it's said that kids can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say it's not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I re-entered the gym.
I fainted.
I'll never go there again, and I'm not asking you to show you where I'm sitting in the well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and never ask me about school.
When it comes to physical health, I’m fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I hurt, but I'm already walking normally.
But even so, for the sake of health, I could not get in and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me it wasn't possible.
My other hobby is animals, so I got on the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from “cats to cows.”
He said: "I know I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something children should know about, and certainly not something they should experience.
His mother, Marina 42, said: "The pain will always be there.
It's inside and getting worse with the anniversary approaching.
I will attend the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory's not coming.
It has to be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me. There are footprints everywhere here in Beslan.
It stays with us.
Gregory is an adult today, but he carries the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He has undergone several surgeries, he can walk, but he can not exercise.
I would say that 50% of the horror has already overcome, but it can not be completely overcome and forgotten.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I liked and who were close to me.
My son is with me and that's the greatest gift God could have given me, but it hurts me to lose the slain.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who have not married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I will never forget my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now coming to our country, which I can hardly believe.
We've been a friendly country in the past, so how did we get into fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could take all the rebels and throw them away - as far as we can.
Alyon Tskaeva, 10
The child who took a special commando to safety
Rescued: Alyon Tskaeva carries to the safe Russian special commando (left).
She is now ten (right) and he does not remember the tragedy at all
The world gasped in 2004 when a Russian police officer carried little Alyon out of his arms.
The terrorists released her, but in captivity in the school gym, they retained her thirty-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and with her new wife Svetlana have a little girl they named Kristina after her dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember the attack at all, and grew into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said: "She's a big happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories he commemorates on the 10th anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips to take better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking photos or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the outdoor camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about 300 dollars.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all costing less than 350 dollars.
It does not matter what equipment you use, but for the best results, several rules apply.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, adjust the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes the exposure to a dark environment underwater.
And before you go for it, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only up to 5 feet, another up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to purchasing and evaluating digital cameras in both normal and waterproof designs.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them don't work out.
Compact cameras have LCDs that will help you with photo composition, but outdoors do not have it.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure variance, take advantage of that.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper dive of light, it is significantly diminishing.
If possible, keep close to the surface when shooting in a swimming pool, lake or sea.
It also allows you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the fewer colors you will see.
Get close to the subject being photographed.
That's excellent advice if you're taking pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because of the more muted light.
It’s especially important if you’re shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill a photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality was able to turn things even into such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the aftermath of torture that maimed him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focused on diagnoses and illnesses, treated patients overwhelmingly interested in something else entirely: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with flu symptoms and found himself impatient and his wife, Juliet, was remorsed.
He said, “I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague gave him a chest X-ray.
He had skied in the French Alps for two weeks.
X-ray results have come.
He had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleural or lining of the lungs.
In most cancers, it is difficult to determine what was the cause of cancer.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But the mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building fibrous material that was previously referred to as "miracle" but today it is known to be deadly dangerous.
It was not difficult for most of us to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in the industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with him, such as insulation layers, builders, carpenters and workers in shipyards.
The toxin used in the industry in another era is hard to see today as a cause for concern.
Such complacancy is not appropriate.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic is peaking in Britain today.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths from the disease a year are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
The number of deaths from mesotheliomas annually since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in the UK
The reason we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all kinds of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for the mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not concern only veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops in which we shop.
Mesothelioma therefore does not respect the social class, wealth, occupation, or age.
Privileged bastions from London department stores to public schools do not represent a hideout.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even hospitals in which they should treat us are a repository of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even consider isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It's possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years practicing," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who were at Guy's Hospital and who were then manifested in the past five years, the mesotheliome," he said in a 2010 letter, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When 17. February of this year died, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not usual.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always deadly.
Now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us get the same disease?”
According to the leading British mesothelioma expert Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain takes place, about 90 000 people die.
Most of them currently have no idea that he will die in this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
Taking a glance at the files from the archives of the courts, to which the disabled often turn and require alignment, it shows how much the mesotheliomic disaster has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that it negligently exposed asbestos to Janice Allen.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she oversaw in two stores on the clothing section - one of the venues was the company's flagship, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children who are over twenty.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesotelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed that he might concern me.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
He was given the name because of his fibrous structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the construction industry.
Today, chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, can be found in buildings.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, but the EU and WHO nevertheless consider it a "great health risk" that can cause death.
But the more dangerous are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolit).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say "there is compelling but circumstantial evidence that this was the leading cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK]."
The Marsk & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete's work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients argues that "a substantial proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely due to exposure to asbestos in the environment."
A significant part of this exposure is due to the ‘normal use and weathering’ of buildings.
It seems no one can be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not have to suspect they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that service lifts and pipes behind the parliamentary committee's rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something as harmless as "a strong airflow."
Ministers are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but in this case the opposite can be true.
Although the Parliament's Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster be given a "positive medical certificate," it is now envisaged that one million pounds and several years of work would be needed to thoroughly inspect Parliament, modernise electricity and eliminate asbestos, and that after the 2015 election, MPs would be sitting in the premises of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations."
It is impossible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Everyone can just wait now.
One of those who has never been able to determine when they have had exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was shown," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day of early December 2009, when he was defeated by something like chills.
He was 45, he was in the evening, and he was in the middle of surgery.
Suddenly I was shaking.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wasn't going home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the pleury, the lining around his lungs.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
He eventually spent a month at home.
The confused doctors gave him a chest X-ray and introduced him to the chest catheter to remove the fluid they had sent out for analysis from his lungs.
Still, they didn't make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time his symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbotto's patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and got in direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his doctor consulted his CT scans and X-rays with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel sick, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lining of his lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry too much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with sisters from the charity Macmillan, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was widely used, primarily in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipes," he says.
In the people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest itself.
The mesothelioma is now beginning to concern younger people who do not have high-risk occupations.
The most dangerous pipes, insulated with asbestos, were in the basement in hospitals, so it was unlikely to endanger patients.
However, members of the staff who crossed the basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where they could save patients' lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
Pupils built Bunsen's kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools too.
In fact, many people were exposed to asbestos already at school.
Somewhere in countless chemistry classes, students were building Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos pad.
A website dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools was created.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos, which a woman suffering from mesothelioma was able to remember, in the 70's, while destroying a garden house.
So be careful how you break down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I was going to have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna live to see another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was the transition from a doctor to a patient position.
As a myriad of patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have left?’
I was told that twelve months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I won’t live to see another Christmas.
That's how it is.'
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made of small fibers.
When the asbestos breaks and the fibers inhale, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleural and can trigger a cell mutation.
"The problem is inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a heart surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which, paradoxically, is a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos probably during hospital practice.
Asbestos needles get into the tissue of the lungs, Treasure says, and “the breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
By its very nature, it has been invasive from the very beginning.
For mesothelioma common treatment options used in other types of cancer do not work so much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is hotly discussed.
According to some, it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
“You can’t remove the pleur,” he says.
You can't get a scalpel around it.
Cancer “does not respond too much to chemotherapy” that “has an effect” but does not cure.
“Sometimes there is someone who survives lung cancer,” says Treasure.
But eventually, everyone will die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years on from his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After discovering the mesothelioma, Abbott made contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counselor for equally disabled people.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself: "Hello, you've reached the cancer headquarters."
“He was very positive,” Abbott said.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and he was still very active.
In the beginning, the Abbotts were offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would probably extend his life by just a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "managed to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the chest surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
“I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called there and they checked on me,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a requisition and they would have to approve his reimbursement.
In order to get the best treatment available, the question of money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when various treatments ultimately inevitably fail, many patients face further financial concerns - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're turning to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is harmful to health,” Morgan said.
In the 60's, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually coped, but according to Morgan, it was not a "full-fledged settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a Guy's Hospital spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos in the incriminated basement section was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
To blame exposure to deadly asbestos to one business or place of work - usually decades after that happened - has proven to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces have changed owners or gone bankrupt.
The evidence of insurance has been lost.
And those who are now defending themselves against the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly don't.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation was passed this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation even if it is not possible to trace their former employer.
The law has created a 350 million dollar financial reserve, which is paid for by insurance companies and which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally give them as a settlement - around 120 000 pounds.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks 350 million pounds is "good work."
"It's an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time hadn't hit and people with a mesotheliom would be able to track down former employers and sue them in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, a former secretary of labor and social affairs, admitted the law "had gaps."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that given the seven deaths each year, swift action was necessary.
"People are suffering too much and need help right away," Penning said in December last year during a second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The operation was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski boasts a survival rate of five years in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott was strengthened.
"Of course that's not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You can see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
When you give up, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
In late August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Control checks showed no symptoms of the disease.
I went for another check-up in March [2014].
I had several spots of [cancer] scattered in my chest.
My 50th birthday was just coming up.
It doesn't endanger life.
It's taking him.
Abbott has undergone six cycles of chemotherapy again.
There are currently no traces of tumor in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how the alarm clock on the boiler works.
When you learn the bad news, you start to get negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not lightened by hope or just a hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings (and eventually brought joyless certainty to Stephen Jay Gould, too).
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma does not threaten life.”

Prohibition of import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful action for injury to health as a result of exposure to asbestos in Britain.

World production is held at two million tonnes a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong power to elect leadership - protesters vow revenge
Despite the growing debate on democratic reform on Sunday, China's parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 election.
It is likely that the move will trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
The People's Congress of China essentially allows Communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but it made us angry," said lawmaker Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong were lied to.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China's decision, the deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership election would cause "chaos."
Since 1997, when Britain returned China's administration to Hong Kong, Beijing has promised that residents will be able to vote executive power from 2017.
Chinese leaders have presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders hold in their hands the process of nominating a committee that is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of Hong Kong's biggest and most-watched protests in years.
Behind most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong is the Occupation of the Headquarters with Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district if Beijing does not grant them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupation in the Rain movement gathered outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that it would start waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "considered the occupation of the Headquarters only as a final step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice left.
We regret to announce that today all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the staffing of the Headquarters is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, strengthening the protection of the government's headquarters on Sunday, deploying police officers and barricades.
The incitement of unrest, according to many Hong Kongers, is a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of products and services.
There are also growing fears that values like democracy and freedom of speech are bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupation of the Headquarters movement and say their demonstrations threaten the trade - Hong Kong's lifeboat.
"The protest he is talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long," said Regina Ip, a politician who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to spread concerns that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perceptions could hurt investment.
Chinese state media have also come up with reports in recent days that portray Democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents run by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780 000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the area's history.
Pre-election agitation?
The league in Jihlava carries the name after the political movement
Approximately 1 600 amateur athletes play small football in the regional town of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is newly called Together for Jihlava league.
It was named after one movement that goes into October's municipal elections.
The tenth on his candidate is also the boss of a small football in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem with it," Mráka said.
The situation around the first league of small football was already dealt with by the lawyers of the Jihlava City Hall and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
According to the city website, Malá kopana received around a million crowns last year.
This year, too, the amount is in the hundreds of thousands.
In the legal opinion, the procedure is not small kicked in violation of the law or the directives of the municipality.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulis, a spokesman for the municipality.
Drawing subsidies from the city and at the same time expressing as a small kicked support in the elections of one political party, it will probably not be possible.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to high-ranking "big" football.
That the CSSD would be created by the regional championship, the ODS division or the KDU-ČSL 1.
And a class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like sponsors from companies to contact us," said Miroslav Vrzáček, chairman of the regional football association.
The head of a small football of another party and the movement will not let the league's name into the name
According to the players, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own area with six playgrounds, cloakrooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, the Na Stoupách course is not ours, we are there for rent," said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
However, there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a senseless area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mráka pointed out.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small football is using a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are planning to modernize or build sports facilities at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been huge progress for a little kicking in recent years," Vymazal added.
Other political parties in the league names will not appear, according to Jan Mráka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field joins us in a partnership, we don't put the other in there anymore," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the town hall committee for sport.
"Whether the voters evaluate whether Mr. Mráka uses the Malá kopaná Jihlava association and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - freshmen can fly jet plane
We are happy to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also said the service also has a security side.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their things across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher) variants this year, we will ensure that students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and maximum luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that as the services have yet to launch, they have no reservations yet, but added: "Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of 9,000 pounds, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and desires – it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to do it.
But the National Union of Students has criticised the service as unreachable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, said: "For most students, such a project is unattainable.
A lot of students who are taking the university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before they throw away thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the dorm, because affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists oppose racism and police behaviour after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
Those waiting for a funeral with their hands up chant: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting death of unarmed youngster Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz has seen a shift in the internet discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer gender to race.
With the rising tensions in the Midwest, which have drawn the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the white women's reaction is 100% focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the shooting on August 9, personal articles with headlines such as “the reflection of a white woman over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not just about oppressing women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this represents an important change.
“I don’t think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privileges at that level,” she said.
People felt that they had to comment on what had happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially defined that they had to draw attention to it.
According to Korean University of Ohio professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson has brought to light the problems African-American women have to face every day and that are not seen as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and it gets 150 likes from people around the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the fact that the colored are trapped in their own country, it's a deafening silence.
"How is it that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in a public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy among the issues of race and gender.
According to her, black women could not afford the luxury of clearly splitting these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white women today merge the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a female lecturer and gender study professor at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10 000 blacks were lynched and the reason was in almost all cases the rape of a white woman," Ms Hattery said.
You needed white people to work together to justify the lynching.
According to Hattery, the split between white women and black women came when a campaigner for the right to vote like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century, realizing that only one group of people - women or black people - could have the right to vote.
"They decided to bet the cards on the right to vote for women and to focus on the right for black people later," Ms. Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We've never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to begin organizing against lynching in the Association of Southern Women to Prevent Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the rise of white feminists’ responses to the questions that have been raised by Ferguson – the question of police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists have had to “catch up” with the questions that black women have faced generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if the activists in these spaces of [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?” Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career in the fight for reproductive law and access to contraception are now finding out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot, posting a Guardian-based Rebecca Carroll column demanding that white Americans protest more vigorously against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but still similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and views on race that differ significantly in opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her comments on the question of race in America are confusing some people.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but remarks by the Ferguson parties face criticism she has drawn before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it sparked an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied juveniles in the country's southwest this year, the issue of reforming immigration laws - this time as a female question, arose again.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration law reform, said that in order to present the question as necessary for women, the only thing she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," Mercad says.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come up with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have a response in women’s organizations,” she said.
Powd house in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it posted it, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
The one-room single-house, which is for sale for 120 000 pounds, stands on a private trip in Ipswich.
The informational photographs included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the sofa of the pig.
Real estate agency Connells said the pig in the photo is the owners' pet.
"The photo was accidentally there, and that's why it's already been removed," the office spokesman said.
In information about the property, the real estate agency Connells described the former prayer room as "a unique single-bedroom house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest
The lottery player in Harvey will earn a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in the southeast of Perth, one lucky man will take home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery campaign.
The airline in Harvey was lucky for the second time in five years, most recently in November 2009 it was a one million dollar win.
However, the lucky winner has yet to sign up.
The store owner Steve Forward said the entire city in southwestern Perth was talking about the win.
It's the main topic and everyone is upset.
We thought a similar win was to the touch.
Eight winners split one win in Western Australia last month, rounding off some happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and just a few weeks earlier the pair in Belmont won a whopping 7.5 million dollars.
The winning pair have been betting for twenty years and said that winning will allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of 85 million dollars.
Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Engine drivers want higher wages
In a press statement, the GDL described the protest as a warning strike for which he deliberately chose time off-peak traffic.
By the chosen time of the strike, the GDL takes into account many people who return by rail from the weekend only during the first working day.
At the same time, we are also thinking of people commuting for work during the day," the union said in a press statement on Monday morning to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should primarily affect freight transport, less passengers," he added.
The DB has not yet released an official response to the strike.
It is not even clear how the protest will affect international rail links, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding an increase in train drivers' wages by five per cent and a reduction in working hours by two hours a week.
Currently, the average salary of train drivers is between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
The drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept a rise in salaries when working hours are reduced.
They stress that the wage evaluation of train drivers must be developed in the same way as for other railway personnel, for whom DB does not count on the shortening of the working week.
Krest's car was in danger of burning.
That's why he quit the Barum rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I didn't even think that something like this could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be temporarily repaired and continue at a slower pace to service where the mechanics would replace it?
If we'd headed straight there, yes.
But we still had two more stages, and we couldn't.
There's a high temperature in it, and the risk of the car starting to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
You've passed five special stages at full pace.
What impression did you get from them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were quick, I didn't go through the vint.
Everything was caused by the fact that we had been piping the car for more than half a year to be on some level.
The race showed that we succeeded.
You started it so that you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The work didn't go to waste.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of did not come up.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technician said no.
You weren't the only one of the top who had stepped down early from the fight for first place.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi also dropped out.
Were you surprised that so many favorites resigned?
Yes. Yes.
It was a shame for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, to whom you are preparing a car, has been at the top for a long time.
But he paid for the fact that he flew off the track and picked up a nearly two-minute manko.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame because he could have repeated the podium.
He was running the first second time.
But even Mira confirmed that we had prepared the car well.
He was going very fast.
Exactly a year ago you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular participant in rally races?
Certainly not at this point.
I said last year that Barumka was my last race and I still didn't keep it.
I decided to go back to her.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance again in a year, I'll probably go for it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people just got to the track because of you.
Are you pleased?
To a certain extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, were constantly asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team goes on.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't do much damage here.
In addition, he wants to borrow a fabia from us from Honza Sýkora.
With Mira, we have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to do things for next year.
Can you suggest anything already?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsican Rally belonged to the World Championship, fifth place there you reached your maximum in the series.
Are you interested in trying the tracks again?
He's not appealing.
An oral agreement with an employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not get an incapacity certificate from the doctor, which serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform work duties for medical reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify your employer of your absence.
Subsequently, it was agreed that the days would be registered as a holiday, but the agreement was only verbally.
Although the Labour Code does not oblige the employer to have the employer’s consent to take leave in writing, in practice this procedure has proven successful.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the drawing of leave, as in your case, may be denied and the absence at work assessed as a long-term unexcused absence, hence the reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship pursuant to § 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a lawsuit about an agreement with the employer, you are thus missing demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled according to § 53, only you have the given days listed in the credit card as an unexcused absence.
The unexcused absence in the credit card does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to receive material unemployment insurance), yet the possibility of finding a new job is made more difficult.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have him confirm in writing that there was actually an injury, as a result of which you were incapable of work (it is not a so-called "incompetence", it is only a doctor's proof).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and an early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to the drawing of leave.
This will avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his return to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just outside the halfway track of the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the barrier for the second time after his right front tire burst in the 172nd lap, and the race was over for him.
Stewart drove the damaged car to the garage, didn't comment to the reporters, and left.
The boss of his team, Chad Johnston, said the team of the car. 14 is disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I'd like us to have a better performance and a better finish," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart hit the barrier for the first time in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairing the right side of his car.
"We had hopes of a good finish until today's race," Johnston said, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the following race in Richmond to catch up with a place in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into a tragic accident in which twenty-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart into the road during the race, died.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received a warm cheer before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the beginning of the race he worked his way up to 10. and then even to 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd lap, Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, drove out of the second corner and crashed into Stewart's, sending both cars into the barrier.
Stewart continued but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague selects new taxi station administrators, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for new taxi station administrators.
For 103 parking spaces, it receives about 12.3 million crowns a year.
Until recently, for the same places for taxi drivers, she collected 150 thousand crowns a year.
Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09) informed about this.
Previously, the city used a draw when selecting administrators.
The winner then received a lease for a flat amount of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer is currently being decided.
"A year after the termination of the original lease agreements and the opening of the tenders, it has been proven that the new rental system is much more advantageous and fairer for Prague," the councillor said.
The most expensive spot is Na Perštýně
The highest price was offered by those interested in the station in Na Perštýně street.
He pays 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for the places in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for renting taxi stations were adopted by councillors in the autumn of 2012 and terminated the original leases in the summer of last year.
The selection procedures were held in four waves and the new administrator found 29 stations.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the well.
We released it all every time, which created practically the second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured Savo in.
An incredible smell!
Our well in the cellar always had plenty of beautiful fragrant water.
And it was not who knows how professionally done, Grandpa scowled her with self-help.
A long time ago.
She was only three rings and a special one, like everything in the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we drained the water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water didn't smell.
We wondered if anything had fallen in.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible, with a little bad luck, there the board was not quite able to reach, so the opening was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing visible in the water, and we shone it to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it.
Of course, we have improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
On the ground lay a sticky package with some cubes.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a slobbered mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where there are vents, Grandpa's invention, were leftover fish!
And hard to go!
Our basement is also peculiar.
Some would say Grandpa just raked the cabin.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and floor is just smothered sand, only the ceiling is underbite.
They mainly put boats there.
And the wheels.
And sun loungers for the beach.
The gate with wide gaps was mostly open as someone went there all the time.
At the ceiling, several already mentioned vents.
Without a net, so birds usually fly there and build nests on their beams.
There is no need to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to make it, and that's what it did.
Now, though, the luft didn't help.
The whole cellar smelled.
We also cleaned the entire cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw away the things that were around: boards, heraclite board, and all that.
Our cottage was greeted remotely by passers-by with a disinfectant.
We were wondering, who could have stretched out the disgusting leftovers?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
She'd have a hard time coming to our snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who is not quite right.
Did he put the disgust in the vents in there if he didn't give us the disgust?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to guard the cellar and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using water again, so far only for washing and washing, before the tests are ready, but it was already good.
Pulling water from a forest well is nothing I want to do for a long time.
We once overheard the terrible anxious barking of our bitch.
My mom looked off the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass beside the porch.
The rose hopped over her and squealed like crazy.
My mom scolded her because she thought Réza had dug the waste hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose partially collapsed into the ball and partially straightened.
There was a hiss on the balcony.
Réza had a hysterical attack.
We ran down.
The Uzh, over a meter long and thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Réza was preventing her from doing so.
It was not clear if she wanted to save the toad or whether she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the little girl saw the power in the form of our whole family, she probably told herself to eat her when we were so hungry, and she gracefully stretched through the vent into the cellar.
We flew after her.
Like lightning, she jumped behind the well.
Just by the way, we noticed another smelly package on her board.
I think the fish smells.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a shaker.
And we locked the basement during the day.
That he would...
We went out and there we each lay down in one vent.
We didn't wait long.
It got bad for the well.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow marigolds on his neck.
Then the whole little one swung to the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to dig in.
The fired employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
The disgruntled employee, after his dismissal, bought computers at the company and then sold them.
He spent the money before he was arrested by the police.
In a short time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers in twelve cases for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"He took the laptops to Olomouc after taking over, where he sold them by bazaars," said the chief commissioner of the Šumperk police, Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for the fraud was revenge on the employer for dismissal and also the profit of money.
"During the interrogation, he told us that he used the money for loan payments," Brückner said.
Police also found that the fraudster was a pathological player who had repeatedly been treated for psychiatry.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," the commissioner said.
A fraudster who has already been punished once for theft now faces between one and five years in prison.
Police have not yet said whether there is a risk of punishment also for bazaars, which bought the laptops below the price and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they were taking over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
None of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come on, just a little bit, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared several changes for us.
The biggest was the change of route, which brought the destination to the riverbank, rather than leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took pictures and made videos together.
In order to perfect my perspective from the other side, I have accepted the role of a personal conductor.
Together with my friend Kát'a, we obediently joined the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted friends who were walking around us to the sector for faster runners.
There was not much time left.
A few minions to warm up, turn on sports testers, countdown and start!
The screams of cheers, but instead of a quick start, it was followed by a cupping to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn on the measurement and run at a pace of ten hours.
We weave through the yellow snake of runners, who, like Kát'a, run their first race.
So far, all look fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky adds almost a cheesy tinge to the view of Vyšehrad.
The pulsating mass stretching along the waterfront looks as if the whole of Prague is running here.
On the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally possible to show who has how much power.
The light hill on Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or walk.
Just before the run to the Theatre, I see a police escort and right behind him Vítek Pavlišta flies at an incredible pace to the finish.
I hear the admiring sighing of other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage it, it prepares to slap with me, but just before that, my leg sprains and our hands narrowly miss.
The run down Divadelní Street gives a chance for a short rest and breathing.
It is necessary, there are places in front of us where the views will take my breath away.
The turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing, and my feet are almost alone.
Behind the first refreshment comes a moment of truth.
When the road crosses, Kát'a stumbles against the curb and shows off the jump swimming.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm launching a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and we continue through the Goat Lane, it is one of the narrowest points of the track, although there is no such rush at this stage of the race, but it is still necessary to follow the surroundings well.
I have no idea that the concept of the narrowest place will gain its true meaning later.
Behind the Powder Gate, we are frenetically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to applaud with everyone who offers a hand, and I advise Káta, because ten claps with fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we're accelerating again and even though we've fallen quite significantly, now the pursuit has started.
We're outdoing dozens of runners when I'm passing someone particularly tired, trying to encourage him with a few words: "Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it!"
No one is ahead of us behind the last refreshment, we're speeding up.
So far we have run for an hour and a quarter, we add, there is nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish will hurt, but it is necessary to really work.
The sun has slowly set and the end of the day symbolically slowly ends the race.
Last run to the bridge, a turn and just a straight to the finish.
The pace we're running amazes me, where does that girl come from?
"Come on, we're going under an hour thirteen, we're working!" I call.
We're trying, we're sprinting and there's a goal.
An hour of thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach entered the limit of hour twenty.
Seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Kata's legs fall underwhelm, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target area.
The euphoria does not make us think of the push in the passages to the locker rooms.
It can be seen that the Goat Lane was not the narrowest place.
This is the destination of the riverbank, which is under the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners stuffed to burst.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for him.
After a while, I also lose my head and wonder if the beautiful views and compared to previous years the more interesting route was worth what was happening at the finish.
I know from my own experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people join in this, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all traffic, it is a huge challenge.
This year's change of the route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped in the Yellow Spa was transferred between the runners and in the race itself.
The organizers around the track and random spectators escalated it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, during the city run through the historical centre, obstacles that cannot be removed must be expected, but I do not consider the target of the mass race in a place that is bordered on the one hand by a wall and on the other river.
If I tell myself that the race ended with the finish, I rate it as very good.
The goal was a bit worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write us in the discussion if you liked the route and what do you think about the situation at the finish.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison service employees across Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest rally in front of the Justice Ministry in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on the list of demands to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The supervisors symbolically protested the month against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the unions of prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"Negotiations are still ongoing," Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of the Prison Service, told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Workers' Unions at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests by prison staff staff.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we can't see them
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University managed to hit the black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for lay people to tap into the hoot of problems that a number of theoretical physicists are dealing with today - an effort to unify two well-functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the case of the search for a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
The physicists solved the basic problem between two key theories (for at the moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and solve it so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even to the lay people.
Greene handled the complex material so fresh and engaging that he could not be blamed for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
Moreover, he mostly corrected his "error" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and The Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book becoming obsolete, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little more vivid in this area (for example, due to the fact that the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter the Greens of the non-violently open door of the world of modern physics.
How much of the size of our universe?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Nevertheless, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes away from the universe as a whole for a moment to something more grounded, specifically to a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you stretch the hundred-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and follow the entire scenery from a half-kilometre distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance, you can easily record the long in a horizontal direction stretched hose, but if you do not suffer from sharpness, you can hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which to walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at the moment, you answer it with just one indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we have to say is that from a half-kilometre distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping the hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/against the direction of movement of the clock hands", i.e. around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you need to enter two numbers: how far from the end of the hose and where there is a hose on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note. Experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the disorder theory of strings.
The non-breakthrough aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circular arrow, is short and rolled.
However, there is a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the wrapping circuit of the hose is short, "rolled" and harder to notice.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important feature of spatial dimensions.
That they divide into two groups.
They can be either large, large and therefore directly noticeable, or, on the contrary, small, coiled and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we did not exactly pretend to reveal the "rolled" dimension wrapping the thickness of the hose.
All you had to do was take the telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or capillary - we would only reveal the rolled dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent Einstein his article in 1919, in which he came up with the overwhelming idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to all of us.
He justified his radical claim by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and compelling framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately, the question arises as to how this Kaluza observation goes together with the obvious fact that we see just the three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly expressed and specified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls, claiming that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we become aware of every moment.
But by analogy with the circular perimeter of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, firmly rolled into space so tiny that they have so far remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer picture of the essence of Kaluza's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a little while longer.
Imagine that we draw a relatively dense row of circles on the perimeter of the hose in black.
The hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, thanks to the drawing, we will reveal the coiled dimension even more easily, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, together four-space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let’s notice the illustration in Fig.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we increase the view of the geometry of the space in the same way that we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level, represents a huge magnification of the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are rolled into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square network depicts commonly known "large" dimensions, while the circle depicts a new, tiny and rolled dimension.
Just like the loops of threads in a densely woven carpet, even these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we just drew them in the intersections in a square mesh for the sake of clarity.
The background of Figure 4 illustrates the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - at such common scales as meters,represented by the side of a small square in a square mesh.
In each of the following images, we will focus on the small area of the image preceding it; we will enlarge it to make it visible.
Initially, nothing special happens, as we see on the first few levels of magnification.
However, when we advance on our way to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, coiled dimension in the shape of a circle, similar to the loops of the thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions, similar to the hose of the circular circumference at each point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have only drawn a circular dimension in some, regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-spread spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has a large dimension of only one.
The more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just about some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly rolled dimension is extremely miniature, to recognize it is - like the circular perimeter of the hose - much heavier than observing the obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the strength of our most modern tools for magnification.
But the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not just a round bump within ordinary dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common large dimensions.
It is the dimension to the remaining three dimensions independent as are the dimensions of the top-down, from the left-to-right and from the front-to-back independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A small enough ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to the three usual still position in the circular dimension; if we also calculate the time, then the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, we find that even though we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluza and Klein’s reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe may have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize structures of a large billionth of a billionth of a meter.
Smaller coiled dimensions can hardly be observed.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluza idea with several ideas from the very nascent quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could be about one length of approximately one Planck length, that is, the size far beyond the distinctiveness of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of an additional small spatial dimension Kaluza-Klein theory.
Wohn Honza Homola advises how to practice electric guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" lies in the twelve-act harmonic form, which you can freely repeat.
Anyone who gropes in music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
By education puppeteer and puppet conductor, whose Facebook profile can be followed here, he has been working as a graphic designer since graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohn, from which, unfortunately, it is not possible to leave.
The guitarist is the leader of the Wohnys after his father, as is his brother Matěj.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, just apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve," advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what can be invented with the twelve harmony on two strings and how nice it is already starting to sound.
If you gain a third string, you can already flirt with the melody of a song.
When you finally add a fourth, beware of the change of tuning, Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonics and you will try to put it together with the twelve.
So practice it honestly.
As best, you can read this in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school of electric guitar play here.
Another goal without waiting?
It is not for a big celebration, acknowledges Dvořák from Hradec Králové
We take the point and we are happy for it.
We had more chances the first half, the second home," said the striker, who scored from a penalty kick this time.
You weren't nervous about playing it, after all, he was accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn't particularly notice it, although on the second goal, where the home fans are, it would probably be worse.
You equalized with a penalty after half an hour, but you also got a goal from a penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We overslept the beginning, we were passive, it came from a corner and after that a penalty.
After that, you got up and the first half you were the better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the goal scored until the break.
In the booth, we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game after it, but we couldn't do it.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the locals said something about their game during the break, they were probably not very happy with it.
You only scored for the first time on the opponent's pitch, while at home you may not have scored a goal.
Why is it such a difference?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it's more up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen, that's a different category.
Four games you were waiting for a goal, weren't you afraid that it could be similar after the last game?
Not even that, but of course we are glad that since the last game we do not have to listen to the talk about waiting for a goal.
Now we've added more without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which is not yet up for a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a crater mile away.
Lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flowing through an underground tunnel from a crater, miles away.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flies out of the crack about the same amount of lava.
Compared to the original estimates, however, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x larger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open even in places where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge flooding, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum and on other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulfur around the eruption, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption of Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much bigger and there's also a lot more gases," says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
The traces of the sandstorm were washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange stage (second highest) for Bárðarbung and yellow (third) for Askju apply.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked down the wings
Air day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 was used by aviation acrobat Peggy Walentin, who climbed from the cockpit to the bar on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings.
There it is dependent only on muscle strength.
The air day in Cheb took place for the fifth time this year and the organizers again managed to prepare some interesting air pieces.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walking on the wings" performed by the German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or the Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his radiant cover.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After World War 1, many former war pilots tried to assert themselves.
However, due to the large number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the program of air days.
Peggy climbs out of the cockpit to the top wing after the start.
There he performs various exercises.
Towards the end of the performance, she will move into the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," described Luděk Matějíček from the Ultralight Club in Cheb and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the highlight of the program, then the subsequent performance of the Mustang fighter was the famous icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter came on the surface with the Grippens of the Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called on the numbers).
Such a line-up could be seen by aviation fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone breathtaking acrobatics with the aircraft from 1945.
He was still made during the war, but probably never attended.
He was included in the Army Reserves.
He has worked in the civil sphere since 1963.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today it has its home hangar at the airport in Mnichovo Hradiště.
Another pearl of the Cheb Air Day, the twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor, is also in the same place.
There was no massive machine to be overlooked at the airport.
His polished aluminum cover glowed into the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force also won the admiration.
The small airliner took over for the renounced Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from Hof to the air day.
The German neighbors in Cheb performed with reconstructed aircraft Jak 18T or the three-member formation of biplanes Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhyová: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
Lucie Borhyová exchanged her parental worries for the working ones at least for tonight.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter clearly doesn't know any of this.
The moderation of the TV news went well, as if she had not stopped with him for two months!
It is only two weeks since the blonde ended up sixteen, during which women experience the greatest stress after childbirth.
Lucie, however, will not be regularly shown in the main news session of TV Nova.
According to Blesk.cz, the regular return will be in a month.
After all, her daughter Linda needs her now more than TV viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit in the black.
Exhibition in a year in Prague?
The hall would sell out, Jagr plans a farewell
It would be worthy if something like this were done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union will deal with it," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called The Golden Match, in which the stunning Nagano team met again.
Even the players involved in the golden hat-trick.
The players would have a taste, wouldn't they?
Certainly.
It would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think you can find one two days during the tournament, when it is completely free and where such a match could be mixed.
We will tell Gum (Jiří Šlégr) or Béďa Ščerban (the organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play the New Jersey playoffs?
So when I come...
You don’t want to play in the team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow amend your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and performances are decisive in the representation.
It's one thing that people would like to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who have it and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you enjoy the Nagano reunion?
The meeting with the players was great.
You have a lot of fun and has had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was the tribute to Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to be reminded of the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving that was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Do you remember your first match?
Such things are not forgotten.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three youngsters: I, Robert Holik and Robert Reichel, came in one three.
It was the first official start for everyone.
Well, that we would dominate in some way, so I can't say.
Dominik Hašek was catching in Jihlava after a long time.
What did you think of his performance?
I'll never be surprised by Hashan on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to quit the team).He just caught excellently.
Even Hnilička did great.
You were training with me one night and he was a leaky one night.
And now he was catching fabulously.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, footballers start qualifying
The Smíchov NH Hotel was visited by prominent guests on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr Cech from Chelsea, the national coach Pavel Vrba...
And over there, the figure in the black cap, that's Tomáš Rosický!
The Arsenal midfielder and captain of the team arrived at a reunion around half past twelve among the last.
We have a great game against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn’t be looking forward?” said when he was already in the representative kit in front of reporters.
Czech national team program
Monday 1 September: the start of the reunion, the first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open to fans (18:30, Letná) Autograph signing (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of reunion
Rosicky and Co. can support fans before Wednesday's game against the USA (20:15).
The team opened Tuesday's training, which begins at Letná at 18:30.
And he will be followed by an autograph session, which Rosický and Čech will not miss.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be calmer.
This is praised by Coach Vrba, who complained about the number of social events in the spring.
We will finally focus on what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to rehearse things that have not been so much time so far,” said Vrba, who has been officially leading the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has three matches under Vrba, all preparatory.
With Norway and Finland, she drew 2:2 and lost to Austria 1:2.
However, these results were not yet important.
That's only now.
The match with the Netherlands will start qualifying for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could handle the general against the USA.
The first half of the year was for us to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player of the twenty-three-member nomination, who has health problems, is striker David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
If he did not manage to recover by Wednesday's game against the USA, coach Vrba would call in one more striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she would die after a misdiagnosis for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said a misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
Around 23,000 people are believed to be suffering from CMT in the UK, which can show symptoms in motor skills such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
Insensitivity or pain may also occur in those affected, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be confined to a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two, who is now 51, says: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I fell down every day and everything took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with other children, and I was bullied at school because of the way I used to walk and run.”
When Rodgers was thirteen and she was after several operations to release her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room, and looked into her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the illness in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, I was completely panicked.
I thought that by the time I'm eighteen, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and I'd be dead by the time I'm twenty-five, and in the meantime, I'm going to gradually lose all my powers.
I was all alone and planned my funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had anticipated, and asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it will be something much less life-threatening.”
After undergoing several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a child of fortune," she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of awareness about the CMT to draw attention to the disease.
Businessmen in Washington area: with the turn of the economy, taxes are rising
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local taxation of firms in the country with accelerating recovery of the economy rose slightly last year and firms in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia combined to pay $27.6 billion in state and local coffers for the fiscal year 2013, a 3.8% higher amount than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was the third consecutive growth year in 2009 and 2010 when taxes were downgraded.
According to a study conducted by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political grouping Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3% than local levies, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is from a trade tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, has proportionally the smallest tax revenue from the business.
The researchers say the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which increased property taxes this year after three consecutive years with a growth of -1% by 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from major states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation appears to be in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginie last year paid over ten billion dollars in both state and local property taxes, representing an annual increase of 4.2% compared to $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, an apparent increase in the value of real estate is not so much driven upwards by state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than a fifth of the company's taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., property tax accounts for nearly half of state and local taxation.
“In Maryland, he owns a lot of companies’ properties, especially the tax base around D.C., the government, or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely a lot more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the healing real estate market.
According to the data, business revenue also appears to be increasing.
Firms in the region have posted a $2.3 billion in income tax on trading companies that have increased from $2.1 billion from 2012.
Maryland collected one billion dollars in corporate income taxes, most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing in these three places as quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of 6% of all three districts (all of which have the same taxation).
The tax rate of companies in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year showed Virginia has lower state and local taxation and an overall more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia is facing pressure from competition from the South.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing the tax on companies from 6.9% to 6%, just like Virginia, and next year the tax will be cut to 5%.
If the state continues to meet income targets in the coming year, the statutory rate of income taxation could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businessmen in Washington are doing better, and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
A trade tax levied on small businesses as a personal income tax - a structure of compensation for increasing costs by raising prices, according to which most firms are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say the trend and national increase in the trade tax are likely to continue next year, with total sales revenues for both state and local governments increasing to 6.2% over the same period last year for the first three quarters of 2014.
But Washington may fall behind the others because cutting state spending is taking its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorussia and Lafat's scissors
Will a new state be created in Ukraine?
Putin calls for negotiations on Novorussia
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government troops have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European firms that, following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
The end of the conflict depends on Kiev, and so it cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has claimed the right to disagree with part of it
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is due to propose within a week the form of a further hardening of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU summit decided last night.
Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent president of the meetings of the member countries, told reporters.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to move the form of sanctions are due to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the EU's new "president."
Van Rompuy replaces in December
At the European Union summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to head the European Council, the so-called EU president who heads the summits of member countries.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two-and-a-half years from December.
Catherine Ashton will be replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian, who will thus become Vice-President of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it is just not talked about
Helping an incurable and long-term suffering patient with leaving life?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legally possible.
Nevertheless, it is clear from the statements of the doctors who addressed the LN that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The heaviest chapter of neurology, doctor says about sclerosis
Approximately three hundred people suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the Czech Republic, while 21 patients undergo experimental stem cell treatment in Motol, Prague.
We don't know if it will be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a Motol neurologist.
It shows the CIA's manuscript, they needed war, Huml writes about the downing of flight MH17
Member of the ČSSD Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the harsh sanctions that were announced with regard to the downing of a civilian plane with almost 300 dead were caused deliberately by the Ukrainian army."
According to the legislator, the CIA's manuscript is also known.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are coming up and the parties are once again offering the impossible
The end of the homeless on the streets, parking for every family and a cable car above Prague.
Before every election, this is repeated: the parties promise the impossible.
Also now, with the upcoming local elections, politicians are competing over who will please voters better.
News server Lidovky.cz has selected impossible promises from the present and past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkerque.
A fierce siege began
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander, Alois Liška, has consistently asked for the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side eventually complied and classified this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of German troops.
SUMMARY: Pilsen leads the league in front of the Prague "S", Liberec declassified Baník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the Football League, which he leads by a point ahead of both Prague "S".
The changes at the head of the table were caused by the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the domestic league, defeating Jablonec thanks to two of Lafat's hits.
The record win in the year was credited to Liberec, which was shot by Baník Ostrava 6:0.

How to survive a return from vacation?
Do not rush anywhere and get some sleep
The last days of the holiday are ahead of us.
Getting used to getting used to returning from a sunny beach or cottage to a normal working pace can be a hassle for many.
It can also be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with a changed situation: not to rush and indulge in quality sleep.
Joan Rivers family: 'We're keeping our fingers crossed'
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days, since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she was not losing hope that the eighty-one-year-old comedian would recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're keeping our fingers crossed for her.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a phone call to the emergency services, according to which she suffered a cardiac arrest for a Yorkwill endoscopy on the Upper East Side, according to the source.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under close supervision until she is sure of her condition, which remains "serious."
The reactions did not wait long, including incredible support on the Internet from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is twisted by subtitles
That the media distorts reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) no news.
I know the headlines "sell" the newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me very much lately, the word annoys them more apt.
This is particularly the case with articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel attacked Gaza" are quite common.
It is only in the text that you will read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
This then appears the headline "Both sides violated the ceasefire."
Does the journalistic community realize that through this procedure it directly participates in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been sixty years since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived Shoa.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans "Jewish pigs" and similar debullies, it twitched.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews were appointed for the destruction of the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as the "guardian dogs of democracy."
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to be preserved if one of our neighbors decides to destroy the Czech nation and erases the Czech Republic from the world map?
You might also need to realize one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live on the territory of the state of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don't go among their own, like Gaza, to answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top-notch health care (I saw with my own eyes how Arabs routinely go to the top private Hadassa Hospital, which is funded by sponsorship donations from Jews around the world, and are of course treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help for Gaza, and thus this troubled area, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Report on Hamas's practices, about its abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas aims to destroy the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Inform you that in the nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area may have been flourishing thanks to humanitarian assistance from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which Gaza administrators do not pay and even get upset that sometimes power supplies are interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide bombers could penetrate the territory of Israel, but perhaps in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived considerably better.
Amazon buys for $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed Information's claim Monday morning: Internet retailer - a video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement sparked surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, selling Google's Twitch for one billion looked certain, and that connection seemed natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago by Justin.tv, was on his way to becoming a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online broadcasts of games on it - in the words of Business Insider "YouTube for live-streamed gaming."
The Interaface of Twitch.
There are already popular “Let’s play” videos on YouTube, a kind where sages (mostly older) give Mystery Science Theater games.
The fact is that YouTube comes up a lot when describingTwitch, so the news that YouTube is buyingTwitch didn't excite anyone much, it was a textbook example of how an established company will pay for possible competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Twitch CEO Emmeta Sheara said, “We chose Amazon because it trusts our company, has the same values and long-term vision, and wants to help us deliver faster.”
Another mystery is - frankly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they prefer to do sports rather than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about it, games instead of real acting just watch.
It's one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder at three in the morning, playing Resident Evil, and a completely different thing is to watch a stranger get twenty hits on her head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today’s, most popular games are from a player’s perspective, so watching their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that the speed run games in which the Rogers of our electronic era finish the game in record time is fun.
But if someone is not a master of playing or humor, his channel on Twitch is not likely to be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth at the peak of internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon take advantage of this?
It's hard to imagine Twitch mixing into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it might have been swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something every company would like to attract: the hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As the director of Twitch Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of games" and the media don't seem to be reluctant, or like - swallowed - by viewers.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the subject of "Holy Scriptures are God's Word."
The original video included.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of many things that contradict their religion, they often put us before the question: Who will you trust?
The supposed word of God, or the word of man?
As if human inquiry were quite insignificant compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to the "word of God," they report on myths about God enrolled by people.
If there really is an intelligent with a creator with a purpose, then it is he who has created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who has devised the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be him who has supplied other series of evidence that points exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion down to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulate.
And it was the people who wrote all those lyrics that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but those lyrics were not written by anyone other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really were one real god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of such greatness ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, a single scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure themselves against such a work.
And people would not have to believe her blindly, because she would be consistent, backed up by verifiable and truthful evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would sustainably inspire every reader to unite of common faith.
If God had written it, we would not have expected anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all of them are constantly falling apart into increasingly separate denominations seeking disputed truths, and each claims God’s guidance in some way, regardless of continued unraveling and separation in every way.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Quran, the Bahá'u'llah's Kitab-i-Akdas, the Avests of Zarathushtr, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantius are all considered to be the "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true god."
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is on the aisle to some extent.
None of the above books have any advantage over others.
None of them have evidence, and none can be confirmed historically.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the Western Michigan University.
I'm not saying I've proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologies (defenses) because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities and primitive notions once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote hideous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - with the fact that each may also contain prophecies that were not fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written with human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and perspectives of their primitive and often prejudices bound by politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it contradiction, more like mutual comments.
We have to point out again that we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not the narration of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. the five Books of the "Moses" and do not attribute authorship to Moses any of them, because it almost certainly did not exist as it is described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezdras) of several mutually unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of the texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the docéti and the ebionites, and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups like the Luciferians were dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these modifications relates to the King of Ugarit, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young mose religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebul, "The Lord on the mountain" was changed to Belzebub by "Lord of the Flies."
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century A.D. in a series of commission decisions at the Nicaea House.
The four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by simply raising their hands, as if the reality of a thing could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found that they were approaching the same evangelical stories.
Thus the core of the canon evolved from the narrowness of the early Church.
So the Council simply accepted as the Gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
But they equally consciously removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referenced the books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items we find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s word refer us to books that are just words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be thus approved if God were the real author of this random mix of legends, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not very enlightened, rather the opposite!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely mistaken, no matter what it is from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believing in incantations, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would cure him of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales are fish and pi that's the whole number.
These people believed that when they showed pregnant cow-striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone know anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know this.
If the Bible were written down by a higher being, then it would not contain the kind of errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain nothing at all of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who overlooked or supported cruelty towards animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, child violence, abortion, looting, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, gender.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God’s will.
But creationists are still ignoring all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is inconsistent with the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't even have a god.
There is one and the other the same thing in their world.
It is ironic that they reject God's "work" as "the worship of creation instead of the creator."
But they consider the word of man to be the word of God and of God himself, and even insist that the refutation of their supposedly "holy" books somehow disproves God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate doctrine from the deity.
So it is a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were God himself, because they think they are HIS word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their supposedly "immutable word" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited, and often also deliberately altered and distorted by mere flawed people.

Attacker at Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to the New China news agency, forcibly broke into the elementary school building in the morning and attacked around half past eleven local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one offspring in accordance with government policy.
Zeman showed the first-graders in Lány how he had to sit in school
The youngest schoolchildren were taken to their class, where they waited with the teacher for the president to come.
He then demonstrated to the children how he had to sit in school himself.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately you don't expect that anymore, you're already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then handed over the puzzles to the first-graders as a gift.
President Miloš Zeman is in the first grade of primary school in Lány.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek started a new school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to connect Czech education more with Czech sport," said one of the reasons why the first day of school went to the north of Bohemia.
The school management approached him some time ago at a hockey match in Litvínov.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate in the start of the school year," the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year in a private sports school in Litvínov.
115 thousand first-graders entered the first grades this year.
A total of over 850 thousand children will attend primary schools and more than 405 thousand students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
The new art director of Nova's coverage is David Fiala
David Fiala has become the new art director of news and journalism on TV Nova since September 1.
He replaces Alan Záruba, who has led since 1. June creative department of the entire Nova group.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphic design department of Z1 news television.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he has participated in the implementation of the complete visual transformation of the news sessions of TV News, Střepiny, Prásk! and other publicist programmes of TV Nova.
David Fiala has a very well synergy of communication between the editorial office, studio management and the graphic department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
It has a feeling for typography and pure elegant design, which is the path we want to continue to take further in the Nova news visuals,” says Alan Záruba, Nova’s creative director.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, publicly naked celebrity images
Screenshot with leaked file listing
So far, an anonymous user on 4chan is posting nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, according to Mashable.com.
It reportedly gained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple's servers, where disabled users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
A section of celebrities reject the images as faked, but have already admitted several affected images.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for her title role as Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in the Death Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the obtained images and videos to enrich.
U.S. magazines reportedly expressed interest in the footage, but according to reports on 4chan, the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it is probably a weakness in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on the GitHub server that allowed you to obtain passwords for user accounts through brute force, i.e. by automatically repeating logging attempts with different passwords.
This tool has been proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before publishing this tool.
For precautionary reasons, iCloud users should change their password associated with Apple ID.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
A length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
To consider the leak of naked celebrity images as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although business servers such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft are secure much better than computers in homes or smaller businesses, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic photo backup from your phone so that it only runs on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
Thus, you will have the opportunity to move sensitive images "to safety" in time, and most importantly, you will have the space to delete unsuccessful images, so that they will not unnecessarily take up space in the online storage.

A smart way to save for college scripts
Since the price for college scripts for many students exceeds 1,000 dollars a year, an upcoming second-year student came up with a clever way to reduce costs.
He invented a system of borrowing books from higher-grade classmates offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
“I got a book for a calculation that normally costs 180 dollars for a semester for ten and for chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College, Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost 430 dollars, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the University Council, the average student spends more than 1,200 dollars a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options to handle these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is becoming online shops and creative solutions like Schroeder's.
On the rise is the borrowing of textbooks, which allows students to use the book for a semester, often at a significant discount than if they bought it.
Or Inc, which runs more than 250 bookstores on campuses, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
The survey shows that around a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Or Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are bought, according to the National Association of University Stores in university bookstores.
Here are 101 best ways to succeed.
Online Shopping
The prices of some new books may be up to a third lower on the Internet than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of Ron Larson's book "Calculus", Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is nearly 290 dollars, but on the Internet it is possible to buy it on Chegg.com, a book-specializing in textbooks, for a new one for 239.99 dollars.
Buy used
If you do not mind the remarks of other people or the wear and tear and destruction, the appropriate option is the teaching texts used.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for 93.49 dollars.
Matt Casaday, 25, senior senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.”
The new one sold for 48 dollars.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important for working in seminars.
If so, older editions can be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is also a popular alternative for buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and you do not need to have them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow a “Calculus” for about twenty dollars for the entire semester.
Get to know the terms of the trade in which you borrow the book, including penalties for notes, highlights or wear and tear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of a new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a period of time from distributors like Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" for six months for approximately 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, students of literary courses can find the best offers, because many classics are now available for free download, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, walk around the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be joining Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN because it guarantees you are buying the right book.
Before you order the book over the internet, make sure it’s really in stock, advises Gault.
He convinced himself of it firsthand.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from a university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found a torso of a rifle in the well from the end of the war
The well is just off the church of St. George.
We uncovered the vegetation around and started to pull out an age-old deposit - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay bottom, we hit the barrel," Radomil Novák recounted.
We pulled it out, cleaned it and found it was a torso of an assault German rifle used by SS troops.
The find is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced only towards the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novák added.
All wooden construction items have been decomposed over time, therefore it is unusable.
Her body, however, is preserved - she holds her shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
She may have been thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapon used by the SS units, probably out of fear of being displaced.
The fascists on the run would probably not do that.
They were throwing away weapons in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing that the enthusiasts of the Rainbow Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them all around, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully felt the mud so that some misfortune would not happen, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The find will end up in the depository of the museum at the chateau in nearby Slezské Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech
Exclusive interview Aktuálně.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they're calling me from Donetsk," the Ukrainian general Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the local Prisoners of War Liberation, apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
With each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers or the place where they were - or should be - that Ruban would specify with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That'll be it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk, and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in reserve, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests in the Maidan.
Yesterday, when we were talking, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists is devoted twenty-four hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their numbers to be under thirty.
But there can be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already liberated captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swede, a Georgian... but not yet a Czech.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captured countryman and could free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers capture them?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy after questioning, just like any other foreigner.
The separatists consider these men to be rented mercenaries, and they believe they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them a Czech - they put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy just survives.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say it has long since exceeded a hundred men.
We've long since stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we just set them free... they didn't save them from the war if they decided to continue the fighting.
The rescuers are at war doctors, surgeons, but we certainly don't.
That's how it is.
And every day there are more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be about exchange.
Sometimes a mere human plea is enough to release prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust in pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of both warring parties?
A tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't offend me.
And maybe that's what we're doing.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officer Corps, I have gained some authority before.
I never cling, cheat, and always keep my word.
No matter what, I act honestly and speak the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Lugansk government.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they torture and kill them.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even I was captured in the exchange of prisoners... this work can mean the end to me at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (long daisy)... to torture the prisoners, both Ukrainians and separatists take shelter during interrogations.
Unfortunately.
And executions?
These take place only on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
Not even indications that the Ukrainian army is doing something like this.
We have an idea about the number of executions, but I can't and don't want to give the numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They're trying to be independent, and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they're saying.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are already fed up with the oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents - to the death.
As we say, they've been eaten all the way to their throats.
The same dreams and desires people showed, by the way, on Maidan.
And now I have a little speculation: Russia supports the separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be large and the other to be small.
But already this sentence of mine has an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: How do you find one of the toughest leaders of pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the front, I am unarmed and show the soldiers or militants my bare hands.
And I'm always in both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters on the fly or in the optical sight.
The faces of the people who point at me, I always see well... and they can pull the trigger of their weapons at any time.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with both German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a little gubernia in a major Russian empire.
In any case, he constantly talks about it and considers Ukraine a kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is the irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the discussion show of Ukrainian television, you called your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk a weak, clueless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
In those three hundred meters of walking, I always get at least five times fear.
Why, then, should I hide the view that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think it has a share in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians nickname Yatsenyuk a "rabbit."
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of Ukrainians, from which fear would go or have respect and authority for others.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, to beg him, to play with him his intrigue, to threaten to lay down a function... he must run the country, manage it, and protect it in times of war.
In the event of a threat to the country, the Prime Minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest on weeping emotions.
He is the first minister of Ukraine.
And Yatsenyuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything all the time.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why did the Guardians of the Galaxy fail to save sales
Sylvester Stallone's expendable 3 returned less than 30 million dollars from the 90 million dollar budget in the U.S. and Sin City: A woman for whom I would murder back from a budget of 70 million dollars.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz earned only $14.6 million in its first weekend, and also children's films such as How to Train Your Dragon 2 were a disappointment for cinemas.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, their very quality is to blame when it comes to children's films.
Collin described 2014 as the "worst" year of children's films, and He called how to Train Your Dragon 2 with a "functional" sequel.
When it comes to movies deployed to a slightly older target group, it seems the problem doesn't necessarily have to be in the quality of the movies themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average rating of summer movie premieres aired in at least 2,000 cinemas in the period between War Victims and 20. July in 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both audiences and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in viewer access and higher popularity of Internet servers like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase what it already was.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood blockbusters, Netflix's profit has reached $1.2 billion thanks to Internet services, nearly twice as much as last year's 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too heavily on comic book rights, and predicted Hollywood's "collapse."
In light of the current slump, some commentators say there may be something to his catastrophic prophecy.
With the launch of possible big box office blockbusters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoňů and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the decline in sales simply "cyclical." He told the Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest box office blockbusters in history, and no one will worry about selling."
North Korea threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul has announced.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers by the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang perceives as preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang is located in the northwest of the KDLR on the border with China.
A spokesman for South Korea's Defense Ministry, according to the DPA news agency, said the missiles were fired from a site in the northwest of the DPRK and flew within a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea has launched a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media said, citing army circles.
There is said to be an underground launch pad for Scud-type missiles in the province.
It is another in a series of similar trials carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has carried out an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport took place.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to City Hall in Cardiff for a meeting that was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO juvenile tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night at the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A sixteen-year-old girl and an eighteen-year-old man went on a hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday noon.
When they did not return home, worried relatives called police around 8pm in the evening.
A search crew including local police and a rescue team were dispatched and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11pm in the evening.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
Police stayed with them overnight and were picked up Monday morning.
In stable condition, they were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win was on the leg of Vasicek
The 23-year-old forward could decide, but he failed in the two best chances.
After the goal, the shot was called up close three minutes before the end, but instead of in the net, it ended up on the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Květoň.
I had it on my leg, I have to give that chance.
I'm mad at myself," Vasicek sprinkled the ashes on his head.
"I probably should have put it higher under the lid, I got a little bit of it," he mused.
The defense of Sigma did not allow much to Opava, except for Mikul's raid from the 11th minute, which, however, was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanáks started to push, but they did not let them into the chances in the block defending the home and the shots from a distance were caught by Květoň.
We compared ourselves for fifteen minutes, then took the initiative.
We were already better in the second half, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the unloaded chance was not changed by Vasicek, and so it ended 0:0," said the coach of Hanák Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava also took the point due to absences in the line-up, where in addition to the pair of injured, Petr Vavřík and three-goal scorer Petr Ševčík, who are visiting from Sigma in Silesia, were also missing.
Unlike its former policies, it did not allow them to play.
The substitutes deserve a discharge.
Sigma looked more football-like, but except for one standard, we didn't let her do anything," said Petr Baránek, the coach of Slezany.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and combativeness to be seen.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent gain for us," he added.
Sigma got to four points with the draw, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the club's boss Josef Lébr, who after the defeat with Znojmo conditioned his million-dollar deposit into the box office with diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébr's warning, so there can be no talk that the boys would not want to fight," Kalvoda observed, adding to the address of the sleeping shooter Vasicek: "I believe that it will come and when he scores a goal, it will start to fall there.
But after the first shot, I'll replace him right away to save goals for the next games," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has twice thrilled Venice.
The film festival is otherwise experiencing a crisis
After a huge enthusiasm over the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu suddenly became one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the other days suggested that the interest in the 71st Venice festival had somewhat dropped.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall has increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed but less attractive films for viewers as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia by the sight of silence and other social-themed films from American 99 homes to Iranian Short Stories, in short, the cinemas remained empty seats.
Heroes of Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace did not beggen by such crowds as in the past and it was supposedly no longer a problem to find a last-minute place in the hotel.
The crisis is being talked about more in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has affected even such a weighted institution as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but present exclusively in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for autographs by comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have successfully played dramatic roles in 99 homes, a visit to legendary actor Al Pacino has become the main event for all generations.
He also starred in two films.
In the story of Out-of-Presencing, filmed by Oscar-winning Barry Levison based on Philip Roth's novel, the seventy-four-year-old Pacino has a role close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as the strange owner of a hardware store from a country town in the movie Manglehorn, which was shot by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Acting should not miss it - but does the artist of Pacin's format still need prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and of the Italian one especially, for although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly claims to the land from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italians
The Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film after Birdman to be rewarded with a long round of applause.
The Calabrian offshoot of the mafia is viewed in it by looking at the family relationships between clans that fight each other for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, a camera, music and actors.
He was also impressed by the intimate psychothriller Hungry Hearts, which was filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who, with her misguided anxiety, almost kills her own child.
On the contrary, the French competition films received neither the Ransom for Fame nor 3 Hearts, both works clinging to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of the actors.
But after all, two really excellent films, that is, Birdman and Black Souls, are not so little for the first half of the festival.
And although the festival's films have mostly depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich's new film, called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy released in Venice out of competition and shot in the style of American merry-making of the 40's, she managed to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police caught four meth producers in Prague, drugs driven from Poland
"In recent days, detectives have arrested three men, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a twenty-five-year-old woman who, from last November until this August, produced and sold the drug meth in Prague 9," police spokeswoman Jana Rösslerová said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihlářská Street caught a forty-two-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a drug purchaser in Poland and a dose seller.
The following day, detectives arrested another member of the group, based on the prior consent of the prosecutor, a thirty-seven-year-old man.
The last of the four police officers were caught in the area of the Malešice incinerator on Wednesday morning on 20 August," the spokeswoman said.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of effort.
In the workshop of the Letná complex, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Koněvova street and other places in Prague 9 he produced meth, provided various aids and chemicals needed for its production and provided transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He further weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags and subsequently sold meth.
He was assisted with the transport of drugs from Poland or the sale of drug addicts by a twenty-five-year-old, as yet unpunished woman.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler added.
The criminals also carried out several house searches on the basis of the judge's order, where they secured the drug, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, tubes and other aids and items, which, according to the experts, can be considered a complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the available records, the officers found that the main organizer had been sentenced seven times in court since 1995, the woman was not punished by the court," the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was suspended in 2006 for the crime of sexual abuse and the 37-year-old car mechanic, who is being prosecuted at large, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
It was also mostly for property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing the crime of illicit manufacturing and other handling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
In the end, three people were filed by the investigator with the prosecutor and a motion to impose detention, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokeswoman said.
The fourth accused, a thirty-seven-year-old recidivist, ended up at large.
His position and role in this case was not so fundamental as with the other accused.
Police continue to work with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products at very "interesting" prices.
A good example in Italy is handmade chess with a board of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like, prepare more than 40 000 Kč.
The exact price is 43 405 Kč.
The customer obtains a set of wooden black and red painted figures stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fiber.
It’s probably no surprise that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a buoyant horse.
If chess does not seem like a valuable enough gift, the Ferrari 500 F2 is also available (by hand, of course) in 1:1.8 scale.
The price of this toy is 318 305 Kč.
The cancellation of grammar schools and secondary schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that grammar school students have a good job.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been major preparations in schools in the last fortnight.
These are usually routine matters, such as transferring pots from the summer storage back to classes and attaching chalk.
They'll have a little more power at the Hořice grammar school.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature for the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year grammar school in Hořice opens and resumes its activities after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders are so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by entering it in the register of schools managed by the Ministry of Education.
"The French Socialists should shut up and put France in order," says Francois Hollande's key ally
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to "show its support" to a combatively attuned socialist president whose new division of functions has not been met with the approval of the majority of French people.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said, reaping the applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question France's controversial thirty-five-hour workweek, despite passionate guesswork by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who suggested earlier this week that the rules be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande demanded the Socialists to remain "cohesive" with the government.
Christiane Taubir, the justice minister, took a line through his budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious Socialist MPs, where she criticised the Socialist Party for "losing faith in the future because of her."
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes between the Socialists when she said she did not anticipate that the new Valls government would last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked, and Prince Manuel Valls is too. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call to dissolve Parliament, saying she was convinced that it could win early elections for the party and that it was ready to steer the country.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March local elections and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think that the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer be restricted by Prague until the election
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved only by the new management of the capital.
Other playrooms will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
The dog walk will not be restricted.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in the council by the October elections.
"In addition, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current management of the city, which ends its mandate in a few weeks," said Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish gambling on their territory in recent weeks.
However, the games will not disappear, the gambling decree will not change yet.
It's the task of the new city leadership after the election.
Now we would not even technically make it given, for example, the deadlines for submitting comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the latest meeting of the current council, which must approve the change to the decree, will take place on September 11.
The referendum on the general ban on gambling is planned on the day of municipal elections of the city districts of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Currently, gambling is banned, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not change for the same reasons even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
Prague 1, which has already sent a proposal to the municipality for a number of places, which it would like to expand the current list of prohibited places, complains about.
The musicians also do not want Prague 5 around Anděl.
The decree regulating the walking of dogs the city is preparing for several months, it is not yet finished.
The location of the games rooms and the issue of busking are solved by city decrees.
They can only be issued or modified by the City Council.
The town halls have only an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed the victory for the proponents of Scottish independence at his fingertips
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making that mistake for the third time when it nearly placed the question on billboards across Scotland about whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you can't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, or gaining their respect when you start threatening them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots have a far greater tendency to drive the billors out of the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond knows this well, and that's why he repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, in a televised discussion whether he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence, and to start supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and with a grimace he fell into that trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of Scottish voters.
However, the discussion about what the currency of Scotland will have has been more or less neutralised.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and defence of the public health sector that citizens have for free.
Darling backed London bankers on the currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatization of the health service.
By the way Salmond put it, "he got into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland, but to the "boss association" to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a grave mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent domestic.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country."
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots are not supposed to pop up and they have to accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
The Pessimistic Beginning of School by Miloš Urban
Illustration for the short story The Longest Year
Miloš Urban Longest year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that went nowhere and we just lied around and flew with Grandma's summer, silence before the storm, peace before stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, for the fifty-fifth time, the whistling around the mountain around Imperial to the back of Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun was caressing its back and shoulders, tapping the rays on the farewell.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still holiday regime, sleep at half past eleven, in a week will be worse, moments before falling asleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, in the morning to wake up at half past seven.
He's coming Monday.
It usually doesn't rain, on the contrary, summer sneers maliciously in front of school.
To come in a ghostly light on a flat and feel like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there's that school, ZDŠ A.
Zápotocký with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new, boys more tall, girls busty.
There are thugs over there, avoiding them, it's equally interesting how infallibly they stick together and how early they are here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came screaming are now laughing at something hysterically, I think something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything is the same for me.
And new first-graders, some nervous and others excited, why do they even come here?
Because they have to, educational military obligatory.
So in, cold floor moisture and a light smell of disinfection, a poisoned janitor with a mop, unfortunately, still the same one, who is supposed to lend the student a key to the tin box, where you can leave textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dressing rooms remains in mind, now it does not take place, it is nicely ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
The only thing that's coming out of the picture is the stomach tightening and the head is starting to hurt.
A head that finds it even harder to hold a maths lesson, that devil's game for the chosen ones, among whom I do not belong and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, the good fives, hide from the rehearsal, fit in the bench and best sublimate, be there and not be there, to exist only as a name in the classroom and to dream stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas to space, where no one competes with anyone, does not humiliate anyone and does not break anyone's foot.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
She let the daughters die.
She is facing an exceptional punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without help, a little girl was born, which she wrapped in a prepared blanket after cutting her umbilical cord, hid under a jacket and carried it to the road feeder, where she put it in bushes located several dozen meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
It probably came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus I had a need to go to the bathroom, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
I cut the cord with the scissors I wore to school," the defendant said, stating that she was ashamed of the pregnancy.
"The following day she returned to the place, put the baby's body in a backpack and took it away, removed the body from the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the staircase in the house of her grandmother in Havlíčkův Brod," the lawsuit reads, adding that it is not entirely clear when the newborn's death occurred.
It could have been in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after the birth, by suffocating when covering the blanket or when inserted under the jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from the unbound umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman, in an undetected period from February to 12 April, when the baby's corpse was found by accidental witnesses under a bush near a pond in Havlíčkův Brod, was secretly borne by herself.
This time in the bathroom of an attic apartment in a family house.
Without checking whether it was born alive without cutting and tieping the umbilical cord that was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic wrappers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Subsequently, in the afternoon, he and his then partner took him to the pond.
Finally, a friend turned her in
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of the partner.
For this reason, he is not now on trial, only he was punished for a transgression against the funeral law.
He was also the one who later turned himself in to the police.
I don't like that he's not punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution wasn't right, but it felt like human at the time," the defendant, who allegedly was subject to the man's relationship and feared him, did not hide the outrage.
In the course of her testimony, the young woman spoke fairly evenly.
The moment when she spoke of the relationship with her parents, from whom she had left after reaching the age of majority, drove tears into her eyes.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she said.
I didn't buy gear because I didn't want children, I felt young.
I kept wanting to put him in a baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can't explain that to you," she replied to the judge's question.
However, she refused to act with discretion and intention to kill the newborn.
The second child, according to her claim, was also born dead.
She did not stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy.
I limited it, however.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also cut back on smoking,” she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible in both cases, she told everyone even after repeated questions that she had a medical condition, that she was watered.
Even a friend.
The main trial will continue in the Hradec Králové court on Tuesday with the testimony of the expert witnesses.
A verdict could already be handed down by Wednesday.
The woman is at risk of a criminal rate of up to 18 years in prison, possibly even an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise nears three-billion-dollar buyout of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. has advanced. (NCHL.O), the world's third-largest cruise operator, in negotiations to buy Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately three billion dollars.
The trade by Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, which competes with the larger competition of Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), allowed access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and wealthy clients.
The deal may be released as early as this week, a source revealed on Sunday, but cautioned that negotiations may still not end successfully.

The sources did not wish to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Officials from Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, Apollo spokesman declined to comment on the situation.

Apollo has had a majority stake in the company since 2007 since the close of the deal was worth $850 million.

Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities a day after the vote decision
A group of people loyal to Beijing, who waved the Chinese flag, stood nearby.
The Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates should participate in the 2017 election in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first win the support of the appointing committee, which is likely to consist of members of loyal Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballot and get pro-democratic activists to renew their promises and cripple the Hong Kong financial center with protests by the "Occupation of the Central" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tensions, with Chinese leaders fearing that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June outlining Chinese official authority in Hong Kong, Democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the special official district elections and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be attended by Prime Minister Li, is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and the deputy director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei Office of Affairs were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists have said they will gather outside the Hong Kong government office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain had never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start negotiations with eastern Ukraine on “state sovereignty”
According to a description of the events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the break-out areas.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin's remarks did not intend to indicate that areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered so that the Russian-speaking region would be given the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian rebels as equals corresponds to an obvious strategy that has been guided since the outbreak of the unrest five months ago: Help the separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorussia de facto independence so that instead of the West, it can connect with Russia.
In an interview with the state's first channel, Putin condemned Ukraine's military actions to regain the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken over by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists of the recently occupied territory have been designated as “Novorussia” or “New Russia,” a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency published Putin's words, according to which "prisoner of illusion" is anyone who believes there are peace negotiations on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians started before parliamentary elections 26. October campaigns while government troops attack civilian populations in areas controlled by separatists.
“For the sake of people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of state sovereignty of the southeast of Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said Putin's allusion to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been under discussion with Kiev's leadership for months and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas from threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman's interception, which was supposed to correct the "incorrect interpretation" of Putin's remarks, highlighted Russia's approach to addressing the separatist insurgency in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where a majority of the two-million-dollar population belongs to ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and opinion polls that took place even before the conflict showed widespread support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international fora would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control of a territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula annexed five months ago is the headquarters of Russia's main naval fleet, maritime business facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko during his inaugural speech of 7. June suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
However, this vision of autonomy differs considerably from the vision of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's final call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatists as equals followed the rebels' next advance last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov penetrated eastern Ukraine.
The separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk by such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is a campaign to occupy strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This hastened the huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has taken no definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk region last week to support besieged separatists.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion was exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who likely stole intimate photos of his fiancee, Gabi Grecko, and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence made it to the internet in the biggest celebrity hacked-up scandal.
The hacker claims to have sixty photos with naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko have also been released for the leak from iCloud.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Grecko, who is now in New York, told the online newspaper that the hack is "shameless" and those who have become his target "feel humiliated."
The hacker is believed to have taken thirty photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two images of himself upstairs unsprailing by the pool.
Palmer appeared in the film Love and Honor, where her counterpart was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the TV series Chuck Strahovski and the actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence's TMZ said: "This is a clear breach of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted, “Posting photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma's footballers have made up for Lébra, even without winning
Olomouc - The thunder and lightning that the co-owner of Sigma in Olomouc, Josef Lébr, sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be a thing of the past.
Although they brought only a point for a goalless draw from Opava.
By deploying and fighting, the club boss has made a little better.
The money for paychecks could soon come to the club.
"I'll keep one more game, as I said last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lébr confirmed, that despite Sigma's failure to win, the players convinced him with an improved performance.
The combativeness and commitment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive myself for not winning.
If we had played that way since the beginning of the season, I'm convinced we haven't lost yet," Lébr thinks.
Sigma in Opava endured the opening pressure of the home side, then leveled the game and was already better in the second half.
After the victory, Kalvod's wards reached, but they did not reach their options to the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not to our liking.
To our complete satisfaction, however, we lacked only one changed chance," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the approach of footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the side of the coach or the fans," Lébr said.
Sigma has to count on pressure
The players did not want to comment much after the game in Opava last week.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to admit it," said the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl.
Completely without comment, he left the question about Lebra's statement last week's striker Václav Vašeček, who did not turn the biggest opportunity of Sigma in Saturday's match.
But then he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everyone wants to pull on us.
We showed today that if we fight and ride everyone's ass, we'll go," he said.
They took the warning to heart
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hide the fact that the preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized that, and today it was obvious that Mr Lébr's warning was taken to heart.
Although even before, it was not about not wanting to fight and slack off," the Olomouc coach said.
It was similar to the first fifteen minutes today.
It took time for us to come to terms with the toughness and realise what the second league was about.
That it's not just about football, it's all about that fighting," Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that in the next matches it will work from Sigma from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
