Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, Škoda also hit
Defender Filip Novák helped with a goal in the final round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2:1 on the Kayserispor course and kept third Besiktas behind.
Milan Škoda, the striker, gave the tenth goal for Rizespor after the January move from Slavia, which he saved, even though he succumbed 1:3 on the Fenerbahce course.
Novak confirmed his excellent productivity on the defender with a seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, goalkeeper Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer fired the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side managed to equalise five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor pulled the win to his side in the sixth minute of the set-up when he successfully finished the break four-on-one.
The damage in the opening half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after a 1:1 solo.
Rizespor did not keep the state of the indecisive state for long, but he did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of the opponents in a row remained three points above the descending zone.
The competition will conclude with Sunday's duel of the championship-holding Basaksehir on the Kasimpasy course.
The well-secret Cave at the hermit in the woods near Nový Bor was not really habitable
In the north of Bohemia in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in the Českolipsko region, in the forests through which the Count's Road led, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and artificially created.
And we'll go after that human hand created.
The place is called the Cave by the hermit.
In fact, there was never a hermit, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a shelter chamber apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side to the rock promontory and accessible by stairs from above.
It is practically not visible until the last moment.
It will be revealed only by narrow stairs leading to a rock gallery, from where it is still entering the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be quite far from human dwellings, at the time of its creation it may have been on the plateau, where the forest is today, a field.
"The fact that the object does not have a window and even in a traditional place located a firebox clearly proves that no hermit here could ever survive the winter," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone bench in the back, apparently used for storing containers.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are traces of tools on the walls of the cave.
The deburring of sandstone with a canine was quite simple and fast for the insiders.
It was enough to use the joints appropriately and gradually break off the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the tippeet trace and the method of chopping in general, it is possible to determine the period of formation of the cave.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the mess that appears in it, sometimes someone sleeps there in today's times.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you are interested under the cave flowing stream and the nearby count's path, you will definitely find a downward path.
And on the way out of the forest, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minarik is in an artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Filip is in the best hands right now.
The Institute is equipped for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hanover.
This significantly eases the situation and also the care of my daughter Finja," news server Jezdci.cz quoted a statement from Minařík's wife Katji.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip now needs time to recover.
There is no point in giving any forecasts.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," the woman of the forty-five-year-old jockey said.
The star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh race of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, also called for financial support for the injured Minarik, equalling the legend of Lester Piggott.
Almost 70 thousand euros have been collected on the Gofundme server today.
The target is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million crowns).
Video referee took Sassuola's footballers' four goals, losing 0:2
Although Sassuola's footballers got the ball four times in the opponent's goal in Saturday's game in Naples, they eventually had to come to terms with a 0:2 defeat.
Neither of their goals was acknowledged by the referee after consulting the video because of the offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record adversity of technology, so many interventions have never been thwarted by VAR to one team.
"VAR was stricter than road radar on Sassuolo and punished him like no team yet.
The new technology is breaking records," the Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper wrote in a commentary.
"The festival of unrecognised goals by Sassuola.
Never before has VAR been so strict on one team," added the Corriere dello Sport newspaper.
Naples took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to have equalised.
However, Filip Djuričic's goal was not acknowledged after the video referee's intervention because of the offside.
For the same reason, other interventions and hits by Francesco Caput and Domenico Berardi gradually did not apply.
The home side, by contrast, added one more goal.
Electric cars are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they recharged the most in history
"The growth was driven by both a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš Chmelík, head of the clean technology department at ČEZ.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, electric car manufacturer Tesla, but also supermarkets Bill and Lidl, are also reporting their share on the market.
The operator of classic petrol stations is represented by MOL.
It doesn’t have numbers yet.
"We started building our network for electromobility only last year," company spokeswoman Jana Jusková explained.
However, the editors of the Daily exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
It follows that drivers removed an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Apart from a small pumping of up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place in a free tariff.
If the motorists were already paying for the subscription, their typical spending was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility is mainly in the capital.
In the territory of Prague there are all five of the busiest chargers of ČEZ, which will also be overshadowed by their popularity of entire regional cities.
Olomouc leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border area, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In a large-scale survey by the Daily "Czechs on the Move," eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car into the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's actions so far in the issue of protecting and healing the Czech landscape and solving the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers have called on the state to take a more forceful approach.
The event, titled The Last Drop, was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people who have been speaking out against the expansion on the Turów mine for a long time, there are people who speak out against gravel mining near Uherský Ostroh, there are people who speak out against the construction of meaningless dams," said Marika Volfová, the organizers.
It said the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan to contain water in the landscape, a drastic change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies towards promoting sustainable agriculture and, as quickly as possible, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend people's interests, not a ruthless and devastating business," she said.
A petition petition calling on representatives of the Czech state to work on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring Czech soil and landscapes was placed on the Lesser Town Square.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "The End of Rapeseed Depth" or "Less of Coal, More Newts."
From South Moravia, Jan Škoda came to Prague from the association Za voda for people, who are protesting against the plan of gravel mining in the Hodonín region.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140 000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned extraction of gravel is located only about 500 meters from the wells and according to the assessments it is certain that the quality of the water will be compromised.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in the Karlovy Vary region to see the so-called agroecological farmers.
He drew attention to the pros of small farms that do not marry for yields and profits and supply residents directly on the spot.
"Small agroecological farms are able to feed the entire population quite normally, in doing so, they do not do such destruction on the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people killed in plane crash on house in Germany
Three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in West Germany today and two others were injured.
Local emergency services reported that two crew members and one resident of the house were likely among the dead.
The plane crashed onto the roof of a building in the city of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of five housing units in the house, subsequently engulfed in a fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
Deputy commander of the local fire department Robert Meyboom said that both members of the aircraft's crew apparently died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) newspaper, citing the mayor of Wesela, wrote that it was the single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a brake on the landing.
The police are based on the fact that it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The machine took off from an airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, reported that before the crash, the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft had disintegrated in the air before hitting the ground.
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
She has already removed the error
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged its clients some card payments twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to bank spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem may have involved thousands of transactions.
The savings bank had already eliminated the mistake and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with double-billed card payment billing were experienced by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
"Just yesterday (Saturday) last night we updated the system and immediately returned all these double payments to clients.
At the moment, everything is working without problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice is unknown to the bank's spokesperson, according to his estimate, it was a lower thousand transactions.
The cause of the problems is determined by the savings bank.
"It could have been a combination of multiple factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
It had 4.6 million at the end of March.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojtěch will unveil a system of three standby levels against the coronavirus on Monday
"The levels will be, according to the strength of the community spread at the regional level.
We are working on it together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch told Czech Television.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red color according to the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still talk about the inclusion of individual regions with epidemiologists.
He admitted that the orange color would currently be only for the Moravian-Silesian Region and Prague would be approaching it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, sanitary facilities and employers.
"We want to solve it at the level of the regions, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtěch said.

The course of the majority's illness is mild, only three percent of those infected must go to the hospital
Either the Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of coronavirus, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
Hospital infection departments are half-empty, even as infection numbers rise.
"The situation today and in April is quite different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," confirms the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the collections were carried out by the army, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year in advance.
Ten people died a day.
Now the daily increases in the number of people infected are higher, but every day with covid-19, a maximum of two people die.
The highest number of infected people per population is still in Karvina, Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer Center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by hygienics in Černožice in the Hradec Králové region.
The disease was confirmed by tests by one of the nurses.
"We are tracing, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says Martin Schálan, the director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the clients of the home have symptoms of the disease yet.
The blanket testing will begin to be carried out by the hygienicians tomorrow and then decide on the next measure.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of people infected.
The Institute of Oncology in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people have a mask attached at the entrance.
The record is reported by South Bohemian health officials, who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are made up of foreign employees of a dusty firm.
Overall, there were 131 people infected on Saturday - half of Friday's count - but fewer are being tested over the weekend.
A champion debutant!
Van den Bergh finished the fairy tale, swept away by Anderson
The big surprise of the tournament, called Dimitri van den Bergh, showed an excellent performance even in a duel with the player who won the second most prestigious event within the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was mutually balanced, the break came in a state of 8:7 for the Belgian dartsman.
Van den Bergh took a break with a 13-arrow leg and has had the upper hand ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the significantly more experienced "Flying Scot" was hard to reach the doubles.
The way the "Dream Maker" had it in his hand is also evidenced by the fact that the upset Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th leg.
Plus, the young Belgian handled the great high checkouts.
He last lost in the 11th leg, but caught a big fish in an unfavorable condition and closed 170.
There was a huge frustration at Anderson at the end of the match.
He was throwing the arrows more just, and his behind the triumph-wielding opponent was acting absolutely sovereign.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
The gain of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian dartsman that this is his first major won.
The last player to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
Nantes charges have been dropped over a cathedral fire, man confesses
The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday, and the fire severely damaged the original stained glass windows of the 16th century and destroyed the organ.
Suspected arson, investigators examined for the fire advancing through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no signs at the entrances that anyone had forcibly entered the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without criminal prosecution.
Now prosecutors have reported that, based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessing and facing charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his attorney, the man regrets the act and has decided to cooperate fully with investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present a "semaphore" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fill the role of a pandemic plan, because of the absence of which the government and the Department of Health face criticism.
"The degrees will be according to the strength of the community spread," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a middle, orange stage.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in each region differs significantly, he added.
The Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS) on the system.
According to the minister, specific measures will be attached to the individual stages, whether it is the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
The Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on the Prima Partie TV program, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation deteriorates.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on the fact that nothing fundamental is happening is appropriate to talk about the declaration of an emergency or the re-convening of the crisis staff.
The government, in view of the increasing number of people infected since Saturday in the whole of the Czech Republic, has again introduced the obligation to wear masks at indoor events over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government's procedure, when it was not clear until the last moment what measures and when they would start to take effect or when they would be announced, were criticized.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main factors should create a sense of security and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example, from Sunday in Prague the obligation to wear masks even in non-residential medical facilities, i.e. in pharmacies or in waiting rooms at a doctor's office.
The obligation to wear masks during a visit to medical and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí Regions since Friday.
In the Highlands in the Jihlava region it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public areas, in public transport and in medical facilities from 14. July.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in the Kutná Hora region.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which color-codes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to the entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, authorities from 15. June does not require Czech citizens to test negative for coronavirus or do not order quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when Czechs return from countries with high risk.
At the moment, all EU member states are now in the low-risk category.
Technoparty in the Benešov region continues.
It's playing at a third capacity, it was supposed to end at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešov) Technoparty near Hlaváčkova Lhota in the Benešov region continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems still play.
According to evening estimates, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, in the morning there were 900, police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková said.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time part of the music systems actually stopped.
"Some have already left and more are about to leave.
The music production still stands in part.
We expect that there will be gradually the disconnection and dismantling of music systems," Nováková said.
"Officers are still rigorously inspecting departing visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
The event is supervised by dozens of police officers of the riot unit, the scene is the foreign police, traffic and riot police, and there are also dog handlers with service dogs on standby.
"During today, police officers checked 470 people moving at the venue of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, of which six were behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police for the presence of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, of which one was positive.
Police also dealt with 14 traffic violations.
At the request of technoparty participants, police officers conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants were not reduced, the police would intervene there.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said this on the Prima Partie TV program.
However, the number of participants decreased below 1000, so the police evaluated that the intervention is not necessary, nor did the hygiene station or the Ministry of Health request it.
Czech Television (ČT) said on Sunday that the technoparty had also expanded to surrounding land, the owners of which did not agree with the use for technopartys.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim damages.
Supporters of techno came to the meadow near Hlaváček's Lhota on Friday evening.
Police originally guarded the meadow in Blažim in the Benešov region on Friday, where the techno-party was held last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváček’s Lhota, where the technicians finally got together.
According to Novák, no one came to Blažim.
The bitch of a viper: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in the Železnorud region.
The viper there bit the girl, the year 2010, which the parents themselves brought to the local base of the emergency services," Mária Svobodová, spokeswoman for the emergency medical service, told the Daily, adding that the child was then transferred to a hospital in Klatovy.
Zmije is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in the Bohemian Forest that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no danger from these animals.
The chances of a viper biting you are not too high, in normal contact they are afraid of themselves.
And if she has the space to do so, she likes to crawl away with a loud hissing.
They only attack if they feel very threatened - for example, when you accidentally step on it.
Even her bite is not a tragedy, although her poison is very effective against small mammals, but she does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk of danger is especially for children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"A person often feels sick after a bite, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, an anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from Klatovy Hospital told the Daily.
The man threatened to throw the infant out the window.
He poured wine after the policewoman and threw dishes
After 23:00, an intervention unit entered the apartment and detained the man.
The infants were immediately taken into care by paramedics, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police officers, after a police negotiator threw dishes, knives or poured wine from the window.
He compounded his threats several times during the negotiation by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed onto the windowsill where he staggered.
Police are continuing to investigate the man.
He does not want to publish further information yet.
Stosur prefers daughter to tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will no longer be hit by the coronavirus-influenced season this year.
The thirty-six-year-old 2011 U.S. Open champion, who became a mother in June but doesn’t want to end her career.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay home, spend time with my family, I'm going to be with all the little milestones that our Evie will experience in the next six months and I'm just going to enjoy it," the former world number one in doubles said on the Australian union's website.
The WTA Tour will resume from March with an interrupted season on August 3 with a clay tournament in Palermo.
Sapa market: The raid revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition, in inappropriate conditions.
Also, these eggs will be disposed of in the sanitation plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When inspecting the stand with live fish, it was then found that the seller did not have evidence of the origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be problematic from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
Last autumn, for example, veterinarians uncovered an illegal food store in it, with almost half a ton of unmarked food without proof of origin.
For most, the date of consumption could not be ascertained, part of the products had expired shelf life and was spoiled.
For five kilograms of sepia, the shelf life date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers in the marketplace's premises arrested 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, part of which were moldy.
Putin phoned Zelensky ahead of ceasefire in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned election
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in the Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to start in force from midnight.
According to the Kremlin statement, Putin criticized, among other things, the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelenskyy called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new peace of arms was agreed on Wednesday evening by negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is due to begin after midnight at night on Monday, is supposed to be "complete and general" and is supposed to open the way to comply with other provisions of peace agreements.
In an interview, Putin told Zelensky that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects of settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, Ukraine's parliament decided that the upcoming elections to local councils would not take place on territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian countries occupied by separatists with Russia after providing these regions with broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
Zelensky's office, according to the Unian news agency, said the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass and the need to implement additional measures to promote peace in the region, such as the mined-up of areas of fighting or the withdrawal of part of the troops from the front.
Zelenskyy also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimea peninsula and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but in occasional firefights and artillery attacks, people continue to die on both sides of the front.
The conflict in the Donbass has killed more than 14,000 people since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelenskyy has made the end of the war in Donbass his priority, but a more fundamental breakthrough in negotiations has not yet occurred.
The unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykl, the seven-fight was dominated by Novotná
The defending champion of the last two titles, Doležal, did not finish four hundred at the end of Saturday's program, Kopecký did not jump the foundation in the stick on Sunday.
The decathlon was long ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but after the disc, however, he resigned after the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor championships, this time he was the only decathlon champion who got over the seven thousand mark.
Other medals were awarded to Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a shame the guys weren't here and Kope didn't start because that would have looked very different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I had a persona 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was still pleased with the stick and I was most disappointed by the disk, there I was below average," he acknowledged on the union Facebook.
On the first day of the seven-fight, Kateřina Cachová won with more than a hundred-point advantage, despite being troubled by an injured ankle on her rebounding leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she registered only 570 cm, did not throw 40 meters in the spear and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
She was mainly a long distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630.
Yesterday I started pulling my calf, but I'm very glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotná said on the union's Facebook page.
Bio LPG arrives in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its fundamentally lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given a significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre driven.
Like petrol and diesel, it has its environmentally friendly option - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market last year and arrived in the Czech Republic according to a press release of the Czech LPG Association a few days ago.
"In these days, we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed in a mixture with classical fossil LPG to our gas stations," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas as saying.
However, bioLPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic oil LPG, which many motorists now refuel into their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference from classical LPG is the method of production," Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, says of the bio LPG.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and also the distribution infrastructure is quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, classic oil LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining, partly by separation in the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of the car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called. part "well-to-tank" (in English "from source to tank").
One of the largest producers of organic LPG currently includes the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the association’s estimates, about 170 thousand vehicles run on LPG in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment lists a slightly higher number in the NAP of the Czech Republic, about 200 thousand.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6 thousand conversions of LPG-powered cars were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of different operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) has ordered the ministry to revise the number of people infected with the coronavirus virus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Department of Health on its website.
The number on Sunday afternoon fell from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 fewer people infected.
There are currently 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"The jump in the number of cured is a revision of the data, which has not been updated by hygienics recently," said Jaroslav Dušek, the head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people had contracted the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11 419 had recovered and 371 of the Covid-19 disease unfortunately succumbed.
Mobile election units or correspondent elections.
Political scientist and sociologist sought variants for the time of the pandemic
A change in the law is needed to allow people to vote in the October regional and Senate elections due to the coronavirus, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under accelerated mode.
He said on Sunday on Partia TV Prima.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties in the ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to change the electoral law," Hamas said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution under current statutory rules.
But the minister said it would be necessary to modify the provision of the law, according to which people in quarantine due to health cannot vote.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said in the OVM show that the possibility of a correspondent's choice has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the Chamber of Deputies, then envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather record other types of parties) from the correspondent's choice to be overvalued.
Personally, it is then against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to ad hoc to devise mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with the least possible health risk.
He considers it the main thing to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence choice (whether abroad or also in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
As another, he sees the aforementioned electoral units or, for example, the possibility of a proxy vote within the family.
He added that there was a chance to learn how similar situations -⁠ elections in the time of coronavirus -⁠ were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, different types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig's ears threw protesters at government building
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyka Borisov and his cabinet threw pig's ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the "mafia-style governance" that has been taking place in Sofia and other cities for nearly three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade for Wednesday, the DPA news agency said.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th consecutive day, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Svoboda.
At 20:00, about 300 people gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
The protesters in front of the government building played a theatre scene in which they symbolically locked both Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Geshev in the prison in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the repeal of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hadjigenov, said on public radio today that a "peak of escalation" in the form of "nationwide demonstrations in Sofia and blockades across the country" is about to take place on Wednesday.
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the call of early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said he does not intend to step down.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to implement Bulgaria through the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he switched five members of his government team, although the concession did not calm the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government endured a vote of confidence in parliament in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Football coach Boloni Siniša Mihajlovič has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
“What we’re doing here right now is not football.
I'm tired of matches without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
Those matches are worse than training.
Playing like that is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that," Mihajlovic said before today's game against Lecce.
The coronavirus pause is followed by Series A matches in quick succession, and although they are played only in the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
In those conditions, it doesn't even know how teams are.
To get this season over.
Those measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back," said the coach, who has also led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovich, this season is also extraordinary because he missed four months on the bench due to the treatment of leukemia.
“Despite my illness, the break in the league and everything else, our team has managed to take it up a level.
We want to keep growing and to do that we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of a cyberattack by foreign states, Iran says
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials said the fire, which erupted in underground nuclear operations in Natanz this month, may have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks on a daily basis."
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to bounce back.
In recent months, according to Musavi, there have been several broader cyber attacks, which, according to the analysis, were behind "certain governments and groups."
However, he did not give further details about the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month discussed that Iran's enemies, like Israel and the U.S., may have been behind the recent incidents.
However, neither of these countries has been directly accused of the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-tensioned relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a harsh impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. military on January 3 killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and a member of the leadership of Iraqi militias, Abu Mahdi Muhandis.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq where the Americans operate.
The U.S. admitted that dozens of U.S. soldiers were wounded.
Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of Iran's 2015 international nuclear deal.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended production shutdown, now until May 25
Cologne-based automaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
Production lines are expected to restart on Monday, May 25.
The attack will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the carmaker.
Production has been standing due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally intended to restore it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the shutdown, according to Paroubek, is closed borders and closed dealerships, so the cars have no one to sell.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. for two shifts.
The coronavirus is hit by key markets from the firm, such as Italy, the UK or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said the production shutdown at the TPCA is not underway on life in the city.
"It was obvious from the beginning, it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now from Monday, when it has loosened a lot.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in the hostels.
"We haven't had to deal with almost any problem in those two months," Kaspar said.
For example, Mladá Boleslav-based Škoda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed it on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither plant operates at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third, night shift took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
Currently, about 2500 people work at TPCA and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also an employer in the Kolín region.
Cancer kills bride shortly after wedding: She left a message to family
For more than two years, she had been battling insidious cancer, Gemma Sisson, and when she seemed to have beaten the cancer, the disease came again.
The thirty-nine-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, eventually ended up in a bed in a hospice, where she still had time to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, they traveled around competitions taking place around the world.
A thirty-nine-year-old woman was playing sports and living healthy, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began exhaustive treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma really seemed to have managed to win over cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time it attacked the spine.
According to the Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent ten-hour spinal surgery and then began drastic treatment again.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-nineth birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the handsome blonde finally decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for the last time for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post appeared on her social media account that Gema had written for her family.
"If this has been published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank enough Ricky, who was by my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network, saying the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she found peace.
"I'm also grateful for all the support I've received from all my followers on social media," she wrote, noting that everyone should value their lives and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For one hundred crowns, passers-by will receive a pocket work of mostly beginning Czech artists.
Pictures and other creations create directly for the art, so they know in advance that they have to fit into the size of 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text in the package about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Widžová, the project's curator.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can be surprised what work of art he will get.
Currently, he can become a new owner of fanciful illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-views from Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutková prepared a pexeso associated with a walk through Prague.
Cards should be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell a pocket pack of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the troudnate and the divination cards, the second series of illustrations based on her comic Spiritist.
Health care salaries will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
According to Vojtěch, the increase is unrealistic
Health salaries could rise by a maximum of five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) told Czech Television.
The union's demand for a raise of up to 15 per cent is considered unrealistic.
He also said the state should try to be self-sufficient in securing protective equipment.
According to him, the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (of salaries) may be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when since March it has intervened in the selection of the insurance pandemic coronavirus and government regulations against its spread.
Insurance companies' incomes fell at the time.
"I find the increase unrealistic by 15 percent at the moment," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, the nurse will reach 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the wages of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The ÚZIS data also show that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic in 2019 was 34 125 crowns, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Representatives of trade unionists said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent for 2021, ideally by 15 percent.
They have long criticized the significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow the salary tables, and contractual wages in hospitals of cities, counties or private ones.
They also call for the pay tables to be uniform for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns a month.
For example, doctors’ wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should perceive how the current state is.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns due to the effects of the COVID epidemic, of which 1.75 billion are to go to the rewards of health workers in hospitals and social services.
The Council of Health Care Providers, according to Šmucler, disagrees with the across-the-board increase in salaries next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals themselves and the medical facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the Administration of State Material Reserves (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical aid in its possession.
He is waiting for the selection procedures to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
A scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they say
"The smart quarantine works, there's something to improve of course.
We'll discuss it with the military tonight.
The army works perfectly and the question is whether they should not control the whole thing again," the prime minister said on his Facebook show, Hey People, on Sunday.
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and hygiene stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the prime minister, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where some of the current outbreaks are.
Jan Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, told the Czech News Agency that he did not have information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The military is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Department of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a ninety-member central management team established under the military as an advisory body of the government, led by former minister's deputy Roman Prymula.
The scructum project was criticised on Sunday by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
He, too, has said that the army could take him again.
The government commissioner for IT and digitization, Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, has previously admitted the shortcomings in the project.
"The system is working, but it's still being worked on.
Twenty years were created independently and non-systemically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It can't be jeted.
People on the move, the poor on the hygiene on the fly are adapting the new systems and catching up the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "go crazy in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not run in the next local elections.
The reason is the effort to "do not fool around in politics," he told news server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO movement bureau, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I told myself that I would last one term and with the experience of the business, I can flip everything here and get on my feet," he told Respect.
He added that he had allowed himself to be persuaded to some extent for a second term.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics," added Macura, who in an interview described himself as a tough introvert who doesn't like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation for a long time about Macur's possible end in the Yes movement.
The server recalls that Macura has criticized the ANO movement several times, for example, for its alliance with the SPD movement or for the support of Miloš Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few ANO personalities, he supported Zeman’s opponent Jiří Drahoš in the election.
Macura does not plan to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel like I can change something in the movement, that it's not a completely futile fight and that no one is coffinging me, I don't have an immediate motive to end," he told Respect.
Sixty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura was also the CEO of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat in the bodies of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno to offer shipping services
Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
It is a consequence of the change in the law, Brno Councillor for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, the change in the law has changed the conditions for the operation of ordinary taxis and alternative taxis since July.
Kratochvíl has held several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"On this basis, the company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is a consequence of a change in the law that allows this company to operate legally.
The city has been acquainted with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber has worked in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him because of not marking vehicles like a taxi or missing taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction that banned Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but at the end of the year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to keep Uber in Brno working.
According to later decisions of the courts, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
He will now return on the basis of a change in the law.
From July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: the flying chair fell a meter from a man on the pavement
An office chair flew from the fourth floor of the apartment building on Saturday evening in Brno and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
At that moment, a pedestrian came after him, who immediately called the officers.
The patrol noticed an open window immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, under which there was still a chair and several cans and butts beside it.
"The noise that was coming from the room on the fourth floor suggested that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
Officers walked down the corridor to the apartment and asked three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation," police spokesman Jakub Ghanem said.
The request for the dismissal of Rafaj will be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss the demand for the dismissal of the head of the Antitrust Office (ÚOHS), Petr Rafaj, with the Social Democrats on Monday.
The appeal of Rafaj was called for by non-profit organizations at the meeting of the anti-corruption council of the government and also the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats say the exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to the Czech News Agency, Rafaj was not invited to the Cabinet Office for Monday.
His second term will expire in the middle of next year, under the law he cannot be appointed for a third time.
His dismissal is within the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the appeal of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is supposed to be, among other things, Rafaj's recent cases.
In the past week, the prime minister declined to comment on the request, saying he would get acquainted with the materials and that the government parties would take a "some position" on it.
He also stated that he has not yet discussed the calls with the president, he does not have a meeting with him in the near future.
According to the Office's statement on the appeal, there is no reason because Rafaj has not been charged with anything.
The servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz have reported in the past week that the police are interested in Rafaj’s meetings with Governor Jiří Čunek.
The meetings were linked, among other things, to the decision to compete for the project of the controversial new Zlín hospital for eight billion, which Čunek strongly promotes.
Cunek admitted the meeting, according to him, together dealing with his "senate activities."
Rafaj speaks the same way.
The council of the Ústí Region called for the removal of Rafaj to the government at the end of June.
It also calls for reform of the Office's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the Office regarding public procurement according to the Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek is not transparent and has the hallmarks of arbitrary.
Last March, police intervened at the antitrust authority over a tender to collect a toll.
This June, news server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj is using apartments written on the company of influential behind-the-scenes player of the ČSSD, Alexander Čuba.
However, a deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj’s account.
The Chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition is Rafaj from 9. July 2009, appointed the president of the former Social Democrat MP for his second term in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year term expires.
The Antitrust Act states that the president can dismiss the chairman of the office on a proposal from the government.
It may only be dismissed if it does not perform office for more than six months, or seriously violates the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
Employees collapsed in the Blanna library.
Will air conditioning help
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we go to the library in the center of Blansko regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was impossible to stay there.
It was awful heat and bad air.
Ventilation didn't help.
That's why I'm glad for the air conditioning," said one of the Blansko readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Dlapa, the temperatures in the building often climbed up to thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glassed and on sunny days it acts as a greenhouse.
"In addition, the sun is leaning into it a large part of the day thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual departments, because overnight the windows must be closed for safety reasons.
We often have thirty degrees in the library since morning," Dlapa said.
The worst part was the study room and the reading room on the third floor.
And one floor up then the exhibition rooms and the principal's office.
The climate was also unpleasant in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Several times it happened that the librarians collapsed at work and ended up in incapacity for work.
The problem also regularly occurred in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe there," Dlapa remarked.
Originally, representatives of the city wanted to do air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of the limited funding, air conditioning will have only the most problematic spaces.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and children's department one floor higher," informed Jiří Svoboda from the Blanský Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase, workers installed air-conditioning and modified the wiring in the above-mentioned premises last autumn.
Approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of those, about nine hundred are under fifteen.
Chicago's support has driven out the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game
Not every one of the infected athletes comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who keep quiet about the health of players like a grave and publish nothing at all.
As one of the few, he stepped out of the Crawford lineup.
The thirty-five-year-old native of Montreal was only present at the first training session, having been absent from the line-up ever since.
"I would like to inform you all that I have tested positive for Covid-19 and because of this I have spent the last fortnight locked up in my home," he revealed the reason for his absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford is ready to throw himself into full strain again.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goalie has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goal post for the 10th season in a row.
The Blackhawks are expecting a preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in the pre-round.
Thousands protest in Israel against prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several places of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is dealing with the coronavirus crisis.
The manifestos took place, among other things, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in the city of Caesarea, near his official residence or in a park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been held regularly for weeks.
Their participants are demanding the resignation of Netanyahu over a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government is handling the next wave of the coronavirus outbreak.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the Emperor has lost his clothes," another said.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is Israel's first prime minister to serve.
He is charged in three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He denies all the accusations and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, more than 300 witnesses are summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
455 people died in connection with the outbreak.
The Israeli government imposed quarantine measures in March that helped reduce daily increases in those infected.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions since the end of April, the number of infected people began to grow again significantly at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, tradesmen affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters are also annoyed that the government is issuing conflicting guidelines in places as part of the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and perished.
The body had to be cut from the wreckage by firefighters
The tragic accident happened around 23 o'clock near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapy Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at a considerable speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be rescued from the wreckage by firefighters, among other things, they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are being investigated by police officers.
They ordered a judicial autopsy to clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
The end with wasting and spewing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change in strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is not new.
Incinerators and landfills, billions of clothes end up annually.
However, the view of slow fashion, often a despised approach to dress, has changed quite quickly in recent years.
About half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, will not be easily bought.
The company does not want to spew one collection after another and at the end of each season to make products cheaper below their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner Michal Mička, the times of new and old collections are gone and the blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends.
"Most merchants already count discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
It's actually a bit of a scam," says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company also wants to support local business.
"Every product of ours is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and above-season.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is typical in the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti introduces RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city management liked the proposal," said Vacek, who completed his work after a fortnight of intensive work.
It consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origins, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton's organization, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the UK, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then underwent pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He joined the combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, who has been known by people in the street graphic art industry under the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in the streets of Teplice for more than 20 years.
With graffiti he started on the areas that were allocated for these purposes by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna has reached the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST last night).
It hit the Texas island of Padre Island, roughly 24 kilometres north of the town of Port Mansfield, and, as it moved above the mainland, weakened to a tropical storm.
However, according to meteorologists, it is a major danger to residents of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local floods, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported, according to the Associated Press.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott had already declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday, recommending people a voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was given to people from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but the element is supposed to hit the territory almost 500 kilometers long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rises in levels, dangerous surf and unique tornadoes can pose a threat," the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning local time (afternoon CEST) the storm was moving in the area of the U.S.-Mexican border and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region on Saturday.
It was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour when it progressed to the mainland, which again knocked Hanna out of the category of hurricanes.
Authorities have urged local residents to weather the storm at home, not forgetting the hygiene measures associated with preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is among those U.S. states that have the covid-19 pandemic plagued the most.
Due to the existing safety measures and the need to comply with the distances, possible evacuations are also a major challenge.
The makeshift shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas district of Hidalgo, one of the buildings was also adapted as shelter after evacuees who had tested positive for coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to their hideout if possible.
"It's not yet far behind.
We expect catastrophic flooding," Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in the city of Brownsville, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.
Forecasters say that in some places, up to 300 millimeters of rainfall could rain in just a few hours, in some cases nearly 500 millimeters, which together with rising sea level could flood a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman lends the general rank to Colonel Lipko
President Miloš Zeman will lend the general rank to Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
This is according to an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for lending the rank of Brigadier General is the August accession of Lipka to the post of deputy commander of the alliance's multinational division northeast in Poland.
Lipka still works as the deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The promotion to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
Since the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division Northeast in Elblago, Poland, which commands the units of the Alliance Forwarding Presence in Poland and the Baltics.
In March, Řehka became director of the National Cyber and Information Security Authority (NÚKIB).
The government has proposed to the president that he lend the rank of Brigadier general to Lipko.
According to the Act on Soldiers of the Occupational Soldiers, a higher rank may be awarded to a soldier for the duration of the performed office or for the period of performance of the service task required by the grant of a higher rank.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division corresponds to the General rank.
The soldier to whom the rank has been bestowed has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that corresponds to the rank.
The rental of the rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted.
"Colover Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
It significantly participates in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and the security of the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defense Lubomír Metnar or Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel designed to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
The agreed standards include compliance with distance or wearing masks on and at the airport, but the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to remain vacant.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement was concluded by officials and that it had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover their mouths and noses for passengers from six years of age, to comply with the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must also be plenty of fresh air on the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airline will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed upon by the officials comply with at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
A temperature record fell on Arctic Svalbard, measuring almost 22 degrees there
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
The roughly two-thousand-mile Longyearbyen is the largest city in Svalbard, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbard heats up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other parts of the Arctic -⁠ from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Center for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it can rise even by ten degrees if greenhouse gases are not reduced.
Temperature growth in Svalbard can result in the melting of eternally frozen soil, which will threaten the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can cause a greater number of avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, that depend on the ocean ice cover.
Britons who return from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all journeys to mainland Spain, which are not necessary, because of the risk of spreading the covid-19 disease.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to go into isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into effect at midnight.
"Protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," British diplomacy said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the safe list," she said.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, the British have concerns about whether they will be paid sick leave in case they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from the holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter of the city of Sittingbourne booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, they were due to leave on Tuesday.
The trip has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go all the family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as an engineer and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation," the newspaper quoted Metro Hunter as saying.
In the context of Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, more than 900 newly infected people have been added there in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife and thus prevent people from meeting in bulk.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The model of electricity purchase from Dukovany will be discussed by the government
The government will discuss a model of electricity purchase from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant on Monday.
The bill foresees that if the feed-in price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the latter case, when the feed-in price will be lower than the price on the market, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously said that the more likely option is that people will save thanks to the construction for electricity.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The intention has previously been criticized by environmental organizations.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact during the applicability of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be spread among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the material documents.
Havlíček said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people on the construction site of Dukovany to make a profit.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns a year will be for the family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay annually in invoices for electricity to support so-called supported sources.
He previously estimated that the feed-in price could range between 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 Kč) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any draft amount, it is to be included only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, to which traders now supply the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 Kč) per MWh.
"With the difference in the purchase price and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, it could be the supplement of the average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to a four-member household, standard equipped with electrical appliances including an electric hob and an oven, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and hot water - less than 100 Kč/year," the Ministry of Industry and Trade wrote in the documents.
“We live in a hugely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be explicitly a speculative matter," Tomáš Voltr, executive director of the Energy financial group, told the Czech Press Agency.
The proposed law foresees that the purchase would be carried out by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, or by a legal entity authorised by the State at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but not longer than the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines as a nuclear reactor power generation plant connected to an electricity system with an installed capacity of a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovany unit should have an output of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit is expected to be operational in 2036.
The model of financing the new Dukovany bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The state should finance the facility without interest during construction, two percent interest is expected in operation.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, it also bothers the possibility that Dukovany would be built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
In May, CEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told the Czech News Agency that the expected sum for the construction of the unit at current prices is about six billion euros (around 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and ČEZ on the construction of a new Dukovany bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development has withdrawn material on tourism support in the media for two billion
The Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns on advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic on the Internet and billboards for advertising on holiday in the Czech Republic was withdrawn by the Office from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) told SeznamZpravy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (the electronic library of the legislative process) was pointed out on Friday by the server Zdopravy.cz.
The ministry justified the plan with a slump in tourism due to coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also saw a slump in revenue.
The proposal drew criticism from both the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to give money for advertising in television, radio, print, the Internet, billboards or areas at railway stations through the state agency for tourism support CzechTourism.
The biggest share of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to televisions.
The majority would be won by private TV Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weekly newspapers would get 400 million and the same share would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would be private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at railway stations or subways.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in a form that should be presented," Dostálová told SeznamNews server without further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this spectacular contempt will get a blow between the eyes in the autumn at the election," she tweeted.
Dostálová rejects the fact that it is in fact about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It may even be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support at all," she told the Daily N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we're still counting, it can be less and more.
It's work material," she added.
The Save Tourism Initiative doesn't make media campaigns to promote domestic tourism make sense.
"We want two billion for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," Tomáš Barčík, the chairman of the initiative, said on Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, it should be directed to companies, not to the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Broth from life, rooster of beer and death like a blade of grass
The third album entitled A Death is a blade of grass by a Brno poet, a tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Frič’s discography, it is the fifth item, and as with previous titles, the main emphasis is on Frič’s poetry, of which he is himself an excellent performer.
Frič, class of 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was passed through his own, personally presented experiences and also very inner expressions of faith.
However, he was far from agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček), masters will forgive.
Frič’s album offers records of authorial reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - gladly - in the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetry compositions.
"They were radiating a proud and never-ending bitterness," Hruška writes, "over the state of our world threatened by extinction.
The world, which is increasingly sinking into numb consumerism and greed, is increasingly moving away from what his soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was a longing in them of the one who knew that few were interested in the values for which he was created, but who also knew that it was not possible to renounce them because of general disinterest.
The poems reminded us that a person may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how he will lose it.
Whether he sells himself to general decline, resigns skeptically, shuts up fearfully, or stays at a calm and proud insistence until the last moment on what he believes and what he loves.”
Paroubek is not my adviser, Hamacek said
The former prime minister and chairman of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, is not a paid adviser to the Social Democracy.
The chairman of the party and the interior minister, Jan Hamáček, only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamas said this on the Prima Partie TV show today.
On Friday, SeznamZpravy.cz reported that Paroubek should be Hamáček’s adviser.
"We'll text each other from time to time, he'll send me some material sometimes and I'll read it," Hamacek said today.
He added that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the CSSD does not have the means to waste it for similar purposes.
"That I read his opinion sometimes, there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many members of the ODS still "openly listen to the views of Václav Klaus."
It is okay, according to him, because he is an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
The fact that the media is making an affair out of it has been described as a mark of this year's cucumber season.
News server SeznamZpravy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek is playing the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is affiliated with Paroubek and served as deputy chairman of his LEV 21 party, was heading for the fourth place of the party candidate in the Ústí region.
Hamas said today that he will not comment on the composition of the candidate until it is finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile-long lead, it's a kick to the butt, laments the Swede's challenger
The 22-year-old American barner has the ambition and potential to be one of the new ruler's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, and last year he was beaten by the NCAA University Association.
"We had a battle the year before, that's when he won and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases it was a very good fight," Nilsen describes, securing the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since shot upwards and is currently alone in the highest bar spheres.
At just twenty years old, he became a world record holder, this year 8. He crossed the bar at 6.17 metres in Toruni in February, adding an inch a week later in Glasgow.
"He jumped six meters when he finished high school when he finished high school," his peer Nilsen recalled to the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he had grown from boy to man, he would tenfold his potential and talent.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record,” he said.
Although Nilsen’s list of achievements is much thinner than the one Duplantis prides himself on, the American sets similar goals.
He has hinted at his options at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, improving his internal personal best to 5.93 m on one of them in February this year. Last August he won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he fought his way into the American quest for the world championships, where he finished 13.
The closest milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because that's where you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events like the Olympic Games, the World Cup or the Pan-American Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, giving Nilsen and other sticks time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under the five rings into a mere battle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don't think it will be possible anytime soon," Nilsen said.
"The kid's been jumping for 16 years and he's got a mile-long lead over everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, he'll want to increase it further.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands on the disability pension of a helpless son.
She's in court
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
A woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to ill health, the court deprived the sick man of his legal capacity and appointed his mother a guardian, who was to manage his son's money, among other things.
"The woman from mid-November 2013 to January this year used a part of the funds from the disabled pension of the son for her own use and deprived him of 440 thousand crowns," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said, adding that the accused woman was aggravated that, as a guardian, she had a special obligation to defend the interests of the injured party.
The woman, according to the court's instructions, set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the son's stay in the medical facility and the payment of the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of the vehicle, electrical appliances and for the operation of the household," the indictment reads.
That he could not use the son's money for his own use, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping out with them in paying family expenses.
"We had problems with our income to tighten the running of the household.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always up to the stuff the son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30 000 years, scientists say after finding tools
The finds from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools of limestone, including a fine blade that could have been used to slice meat, and pointed objects that could have served as spear or spear tips.
The researchers found that the oldest of the instruments came from 33 000 to 31 000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the lead author of one of two studies, which were published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12 500 years old.
According to experts, the people of the Chiquihuite cave, located at a high altitude, have been inhabited for 20 000 years.
So far, a widely accepted theory has said that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from the region of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13 500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including the unique spikes used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this Clovian culture subsequently spread in much of North America.
However, this model received cracks in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, describes 42 different locations across North America that prove the human presence on the continent between 26 000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe a small number of people may have come to the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them could have made it to America by boat.
"Clearly, people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said Ruth Gruhn, an anthropologist at the University of the Canadian province of Alberta.
So far, interest in airline tickets is fulfilling an optimistic scenario, sellers say.
Prices are also gradually decreasing
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still about half, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to the sellers, the development after the crisis thus fulfills the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually decreasing.
According to retailers, South European countries are among the most sought-after destinations.
According to Kiwi.com data, they lead Spain, Italy and Greece.
The most sold flights to the Croatian Split are sold at Letuška.cz.
From other countries, the most sought-after Great Britain is the UK, which has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average price of tickets also decreases.
At the Letuška.cz portal, it was around 6250 crowns in the middle of the month, 3000 crowns less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices themselves have also fallen to some European places, for example to Spain or Italy in recent weeks have fallen by about a fifth.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets much less in advance than before, fearing further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier Kiwi.com information, the time to buy a ticket before departure decreased by about ten days.
"This confirms the future trend where people will order tickets much less in advance, will require more flexibility, less risk," said Michal Šindelář, vice president for Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
Regular flights to more than 60 destinations currently operate at Prague Airport.
Compared to last summer season, it is about half of the destinations.
The grand finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization reached the grand final.
It will feature the experienced forty-nine-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, twenty-six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the spreadsheet.
Even with James Wad, however, he managed to fight Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one, in the quarter-finals.
The "flying Scot" had a little in the semi-final when he faced Michale Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel, dominated the extension and after the result of 18:16 he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated already in 2018, when in an amazing battle he defeated Mensur Suljovic 21:19.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament and it was perhaps the knowledge that he had nothing to lose that helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The twenty-six-year-old dartsman first surprisingly knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, pushed Jo Cullen in a dramatic battle, and defeated Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals after a sharp start.
The big clearance was the semi-final.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the outset, but in a calmly playing Belgian then with an excellent series he got a lead, which he then more or less without problems to keep until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in a high-profile scoring, which he shot at occasional uncertainty on the doubles.
Coronavirus cases have risen to at least since the start of the week, the number of tests has been reduced
Since the beginning of March, when the novel coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15 212 people have been infected with it.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already recovered, with 368 patients dying.
There are currently 5 254 people.
This is according to data on the Department of Health website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded four times in a row two hundred.
The maximum was Friday's 281 cases.
On Thursday, 235 people tested positive, 246 a day earlier and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, there were 169 infected.
9 590 people have recovered from COVID-19 in the Czech Republic, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.

In the world, the number of people who have proven to have contracted the novel coronavirus has already exceeded the 16 million mark.
This was stated by Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
The death toll from the victims who have died with the covid-19 disease is approaching 645 thousand, according to the source.
The newest million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell 22. July.
The largest share of the rapid growth in the number of cases in recent days has been the United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, according to authorities.
The infected are now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284 thousand new cases have been added worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the pandemic began.
This development is at the height of outbreaks in populous countries such as the US, Brazil and India, but the number of new cases has grown in nearly 40 countries around the world over the past week, according to Reuters.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The outbreak has already occurred in almost all countries of the world, the first case officially announced today and the DPRK.
The air in the home is up to five times worse than the outside.
Health is harmful to air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was reported by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, who was quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was responsible for the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, household pollutants need to be targeted right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the U.S. Environmental Environment Agency (EPA) that the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than that of the outdoors.
The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that due to poor air quality in its homes, 3.8 million people die prematurely each year.
"Because of the coronavirus outbreak, which has forced many and is still forcing work from home, people have to spend more hours in homes than before, so it's time to focus on the quality of air in homes," Ms Abraham said.
In Israel, almost no one deals with the quality of "home air".
Danger can be things that a person normally comes into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poison gas is also issued by the garments that we regularly carry to the dry cleaners," Ms Abraham said.
Children, old household members and people with respiratory problems are most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals can start to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
However, not all pollutants come from items inside households, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
Václav Havel Quiz: How Long He Spent in Prison and What Got Him Writing Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost a chance to advance to Spain's top football league because of the coronavirus outbreak in the team.
The management of the competition canceled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure participation in the playoffs.
Fuenlabrada on Saturday reported another 12 infected people, bringing the total number of positive tests for covid-19 at the club to 28.
Due to the infection in the team, Monday's matchup against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada was enough to get a point to make it to the playoffs.
The management of the competition said today that the duel against La Coruni was definitely dismissed with regard to a higher power due to the fact that it was no longer to be played.
Fuenlabrada took the decision.
Against not playing the match, on the contrary, La Coruña is rebelling.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, it would not be enough to win over Fuenlabrada to save, but he considers it unfair that the last round did not take place according to the customs complete in a uniform term.

Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
Dominic's daughter revealed it
"Dad didn't have to have him for many years," Gott's oldest daughter, Gott Dominika, told Aha!, adding that the Master could not come to Havel's name and whenever he spoke to him, Karl was always upset.
It's hard to say what they did, but according to Dominica, the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than him.
That Havel could have written in a drawer at the time of the dark, but if he somehow resisted, he had an end to his career," Gottová said.
But then he adds that in the end, the Czech greats found their way to each other.
"I know that Havel could not hear the word until his 60th birthday.
But then the president congratulated him with a birthday letter and suddenly his father's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
Ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70th birthday in the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because Mr. Havel's father then regularly invited Mr. Havel to his home on Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík was also said to be sorry that he had never received a state honour from Václav Havel.
After all, he got it in 2009, although it was already out of the hands of his successor in the position of Václav Klaus (79).
Another honor will be given in memoriam, because the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion and honor his memory.
