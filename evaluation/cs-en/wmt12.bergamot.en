Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal a paragraph under the amendment to the Criminal Code, on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted.
The amendment, which would open the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-premier, was rejected by MPs at the second reading of the motion to commute the sentences for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding a allegedly unfavorable treaty with Russia to buy natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the court is to hear the court in December.
Tymoshenko calls the verdict a political revenge on the regime, and the trial has also provoked suspicions of biased in the West.
The proposal to drop out of the Criminal Code, Section 365 on the basis of which the ex-premier was convicted, was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
It needed 226 votes to be approved.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, which has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an undisclosed place in the desert and without him is after the war.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists will win the elections, but the question is whether moderates or radical.
The Transition National Council has subscribed to the customary law of sharia, and we already have some idea of it.
Libya will become a country without criminality, as a hand is mowing for theft.
Women can forget about the emancipation, any renegades from the faith await execution and so on.
Instead of a person as a dictator, a society consisting of competing tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we certainly wouldn't want.
But our way of life is neither the single, nor objectively the best, and it probably would not suit the just-mentioned Libyans for a change.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic warriors took pleasure from unbelieving dogs.
It is only excused by the fact that, from their point of view, it was not controlled by NATO airstrikes by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every successful intervention.
When the victors are sought in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in a firefight, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the person of the dictator, without guaranteeing any profit.
After a fresh bad experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not buy Libya militarily.
Thus, the locals have no problem with the expulsion of the "crusaders".
But will they have the Libyan black gold for the spout of the oil company without the occupation?
They may not be, and the West will finally be able to boast the selfless protection of human rights.
Unless this is intaught of you by the sharia law.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe got into the crosshairs of investors
The statistical whirlwind swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated quarter-on-quarter, Germany and France are growing.
But the bond market is breaking records today.
Investors are no longer just looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by an expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, the two countries adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), but France said it had emerged in a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated quarter-on-quarter and thus confirmed the trend of gradual slowing of the growth in the economy’s performance.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated quarter-on-quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data.
The economy of both the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy fell 5.2% year-on-year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical borders.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc. are also starting to feel the problems...
The revenues for Czech 10-year bonds are below 4%, even if the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be a creditor to last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate the advance for 200 million
The national team managed the hardest task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goal of Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0.
Czech football with a great deal of luck in the second half defended a luxury lead from the home rematch and will again miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match in a detailed report.
Hardly any excitement in the first half and a big portion of happiness in the second.
Thanks to the home ruin in the end, the great Czech team and the hero Jiráček won in Montenegro happily 1:0 and celebrates the advancement to the European Championship.
The Montenegrins did not get into pressure until the second half due to the precise defense of the Czech team.
The wrong of the match became Damjanovic and Vučinic, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Cech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and a reward of about CZK 200 million will be added to the Czech football box.
Since the opening minutes, a lot of combative football has been played.
Both teams were difficult to engage in the combination and were played mostly around the half-line.
The pressure of the domestic footballers did not come in the first half, because the long kicks for the defense were precisely averted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their country's support for their country's nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the building on Tuesday at noon and then shouted the deaths of the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Iran's Isfahan formed a vibrant shield on Tuesday around the Issahan nuclear technology center, where uranium is being processed.
They are thus clear that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran does not appear to have stopped seeking a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities are being talked about in Israel.
At noon, before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility, the students prayed and then shouted deaths to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack that would be to cripple Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, in addition to the Isfahan center, the target would also be a facility in Natanz, where the uranium is enriched.
Diet of an obese child: does not eat and dinner sausages
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with an excess weight of 9 percent of schoolchildren, and 5 percent of children are obese.
Obese children usually come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, as the current survey showed.
It is again shown how important it is for the healthy development of a person to the environment in which he grows, and the patterns with which he is surrounded.
On the tables in obese children, for example, sausages appear up to half as often as in the families of children with normal weight.
Fried fries had for dinner the day before the research associated with an awareness-raising event called Obesity is not a coincidence of more than 19 percent of obese.
In families of fat people, it is also not a habit to play sports, which applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children responded that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of the Obesity event is no accident, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand schoolchildren from 4 to 8 classes have participated in the project.
Proper eating and getting enough exercise in the family is one of the defining factors that causes a dramatically rising number of overweight or even obese children.
"Only half of respondents said, for example, that they eat five times a day in breakfast-snack-lude-snake mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition," reads one of the survey results.
No breakfast and evening sausage
Experts point out that relative details are also essential for healthy development, such as regular time for family breakfasts.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of families of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats alone.
And the worst part was the discovery that a tenth of households don't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy fries are much more often consumed.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of children surveyed regularly do sports, their parents’ result was less than half that was 15 percent.
Build your diet
The next part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls out of 13 schools) to build their own diet according to their own taste and their own opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the point of view of healthy nutrition to the ideal."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of floury, meaty and sweet dishes.
"The great popularity of sweet sodas is particularly alarming," the final report said.
For lunch as the main dish, pasta won just above the poultry.
However, children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetable dishes is also low.
Inclination to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the awareness-raising lecture Obesity, there was a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition in many cases," the results of the project said.
This was striking, for example, in sweet lemonades, where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children also ticked poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire and would limit sweet foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, pros say
In the introductory article about how stylists are taught, I complained a little bit that there was already a lot in the opening hours.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures of three professionals from the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on set.
And it's going to get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "treaded".
This time, director Alenka and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And such are the vast majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure without proper curves, and someone overweight again.
The stylist must know how to optically soften broad shoulders, extend the neck or supply the necessary curves.
We were given tips on how to use a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. larger breasts and hips and narrow waists, emphasize the figure nicely and at the same time not dress the woman too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the hips is that the skirt or pants really do not fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece tailored to your needs.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in one that is constantly shifting, elevating, leaving at the waist and the like.
The boy's figure can afford to wear clothes with lashings, apps, embroidery or hipping.
Of course, there are many such information and character types, so I’m glad I have a whole week to sort all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that given the given homework, it's up to that.
Each of the cursors was given an assigned celebrity, who is supposed to invent two outfits: daily and evening.
We need to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the personality and the type of figure.
I'll be "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaigns.
In the spirit of exulting, for me personally definitely better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained perhaps a hundred pounds (take, please, the exaggeration) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the suits out of magazines or search the Internet and print them and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and relationship to the graphic design.
Thinking about the graphical side of styling is important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (on specific assignments, such as trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture charged with information about the types of characters was diversified by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a handy stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is crucial in this case.
For example, a short thorn coat (or if you originally want a trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a cloak, but you can also dress it on a bare body, put on a double pump and take pictures like a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he pointed out.
But I appreciated the following advice the most: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said James.
Finally, it is clear to me why we crush all the propositions, what to combine with something, for what, why, when even in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have a lot more variants of clothing ready than how many can be photographed.
So with a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "cover" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo of the clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
We have to take this into account when creating an outfit.
Honza Pokorný confirmed that image and style sometimes make up to half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miraculous singer, but image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists’ services is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it unnecessary (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look in it is secondary).
And if someone already lets us create styling, then we should count on the fact that they are very likely to dictate a completely different (smaller) size than they really have.
Then all we have to do is googling and see if the tabloids wrote about the fact that the celebrity had longed/lost and so on.
Honza and Mario on Sunday told us that it is not enough for a stylist to orient themselves in fashion and be able to assemble an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Being able to guess people, not pandering, becoming your point of view.
"When a manager orders you to sort her out of her wardrobe and supplement it with nice pieces, you can't throw her out the whole closet and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you compliments and recommend what they can be worn for," says Mario.
He also showed us specifically what the so-called "flat" or bag for the set must contain.
It's the one you turn on around your waist and you've got all the necessary proprieties with you.
In addition to bright things such as scissors, a hair roller or closing pins, there are also nylon threads (with it the stylist helps himself to shoot products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which we put on clothes in the back if it is larger (a pin or other clamp are not permissible, they would damage the garment), or sewing.
In order not to listen, but also to practically try something, we learned how to properly salute shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
So we glued and glued.
We must not touch the shoes with scissors so that they do not accidentally damage.
It is really necessary to be dexter.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation without reservation.
The skill is not my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we've heard about the second weekend's continuation of the course.
It is becoming more and more clear to me that doing styling on a professional level really is not a walk in the rose garden, no matter who says what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run races across America.
Reviews
Originally a carefree ride turns into a routine morning journey on a shift due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes.
The ambition was largely fulfilled, but it is no use when no one clearly wanted to do anything extra.
The new episode, subtitled The Run, aroused high expectations before it was released.
He promised that the long-standing racing series Need for Speed would once again move a bit in a new direction, and from the playable demos it appeared to be a game that would not have to be just in the genre of action racing.
We were also curious to see how the inserted passages would turn out of the car and take place on foot.
As usual with the NFS series, however, many are a little different in the result than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole drags down a few unnecessary mistakes that have been appearing in the series for more or less for several years.
So it's not actually mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced into a story whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal character and as a solution is offered participation in an illegal race across America.
Behind the wheel you get behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings with it some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then to more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is on a different track and the given stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t feel like the game is always the same thing.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, even though the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing world-renowned.
But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains seem visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are diversched from time to time with some atypical element.
In the desert, for example, you can get in a sandy storm, which greatly reduces visibility.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be careful not to be covered by an avalanche.
In addition, individual races are put quite well behind each other.
There are only a few types, but that’s enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of opponents (esseually a classic race), then you catch up again (classic duel with stopwatches) and then there is a duel with a single opponent.
From time to time, the police get involved in this, which makes your entire efforts even more difficult.
New is the passages outside the car.
Rather, it is just such interactive animations, where Jack usually flees in front of someone and you have to help him in this by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
However, he will be surprised that there are much fewer of these passages in the game than you would expect (specifically, perhaps only three).
As a result, however, it is to the benefit of the cause, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the above ranks is one of the elements that diversify the game.
The driving model goes in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it is definitely not anything nowadays, but it cannot be said that it is a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will need to look elsewhere.
But the more active racing local riding model still suits quite well, even though we would be able to find better in the competition.
So much so everything in perfect order.
But problems are starting to occur after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collisible model is no longer very well.
We do not expect a game of this type to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if practically before no impact on any object has the slightest idea how your car will behave, then probably not everything is in order.
Typically, when overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, sometimes you only slightly lick each other, but at other times in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even a superbath.
Thanks to the restart system, it does not particularly matter, but it will upset you reliably.
Restarts are designed so that if you smashed or go far off the track, the game will throw you back on the last clue on the track.
But only five restarts are available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from scratch.
It is more of an aid in case something goes wrong rather than relying on them.
But sometimes even restarts do not help, they will be solved by the need to learn the given section of the race by heart.
The big malaise of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some bends need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply can’t fit into them.
At other times, you will meet "civil" cars at a given place always in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It upsets especially in situations where you can see how between two oncoming cars the opponent passes in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to go around or brake them.
It does not matter when you reach them, because it is "calculted" so that the situation always occurs just before your nose.
Opponents also have another advantage.
During the whole time of playing, you will come across several places where, again no matter what time, the same opponent will always overtake you in the same place.
It hits the most at the end of the game on the long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
An opponent must get there in front of you, perhaps at any cost.
When he rides in front of you, he makes it worse for you to see on-the-going cars, so you're probably going to smash you there a few times.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-fuelled, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably quickly disgust you.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and sometimes so action-packed that sometimes you literally don't manage to watch where what's flying.
And it basically does not matter whether the concept with fifty unique tracks, the sorting of races so that boredom has no chance, or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to gas stations at the roads, because that is where you can change the car, even though in the vast majority of cases you can do with what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American breakers on straight highways and exotic supercars for technical driving, for example, on winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand with the mode of challenges, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common to challenges and story.
Various items are unlocked for a higher level of driver: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, it is again connected to the online Autologist feature, which compares your achieved results with other players and provides other community features.
One of the other difficult-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you get to the metro tunnel (so be it), where you drive it in the dark on the tracks (so be it).
On the speedometer, the numbers flash between 150 and 200 km/h (so be it) and a subway train comes in from the back and uncompromisingly scraps you.
In the newsroom, we probably have a discussion about whether no one really thought a little bit about the creation of the game, or whether the authors think of us as really such a big idiot.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in a few cases even great.
It is so frustrating that in some more tense moments the voting decreases, and in some cases quite tragically.
However, this applies especially to crashes with a larger number of participants, when smooth imaging would no longer be of any use to you anyway.
The sound side is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible scale of a rather younger audience, the soundtrack was created from the category "each dog of another village", but it can be assumed that in order to listen to music, the game will probably not be bought.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so embarrassing.
If the game avoids completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
This is how the game works unfinished.
Fun is definitely good, but be prepared for the fact that mistakes will slap you in the eye by the power of the airport spotlight.

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation as negative and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly disrupted the balance between institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle down a bit, calm down and before all the players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
To the extent to which she takes her motto "Usiblely and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed already in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that he was inconsiderate, that he was a grey clerk, that he could not fulfill any role, and I must say that everyone took a breath away, that he handled the role excellently."
"He is a man who can listen to twenty-seven member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She explained the new post of high-ranking representative for foreign affairs and security policy in response to the question: "Who is this European Union? Which phone number should I call to?", as a significant step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from wearing syreans
Vicen also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council lived, lives and will live in the near future.
Last year, the Czech Presidency described as a success.
The Czechs dealt with the incoming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
At this time, the fall of the government called it a big negative, which severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the ambassador, the "fact frmol" was not only the presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being dealt with today.
Moreover, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is very complicated due to the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will take precedence, which countries will be supported by more and which less, all this is on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe clearly".
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, a guerrhoto who no one understands.
How a citizen should understand that curvature or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes are not invented in Brussels, or that someone really has to ban us from wearing cheesecakes."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative ones rather than the positive aspects of the matter.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, a lot of factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak man approaches me, the Frenchman next to me will say, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what about your Visegrad Four?" and he doesn't even face it enthusiastically."
In the future, according to Vicenová, the Union is mainly facing new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As very real, he then perceives the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European federation."
"We have eurozone countries and non-eurozone countries."
"We have Schengen area, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only countries that want and those who do not want to work together, let them stand nearby."
"The institutes will be more and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all topics that have an impact on the whole Union should be discussed between all Member States, not only between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM Innovator Begins Second Century of Its Existence
If someone were looking for a word that would most accurately express IBM's strategy, the closest would probably be "long-termism."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a very contemporary company, and yet a hundred years have passed since its inception.
The foundation of this long-termism was laid by the first boss of the company, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already conceded the motto that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became an imprint, around which the life of the future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson's carefully constructed corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values, not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second hundred we can achieve even more," commented the current company's CEO Samuel J. Palmisano.
Sophisticated system
Watson in the 1930s approached the care of his employees similarly to the entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were one of the first American employees to pay leave, employer insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system for the remuneration of the best inventors and traders.
IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
The company was brilliant in mining talent from the start - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination so that it could choose.
In line with the anti-disciprimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisan, led by IBM, will be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty next year.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years, so far she holds the position of Sales, Marketing and Strategy Chief of Sales.
IBM has been making so-called jams in recent years, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
No wonder there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good name
A firm position in business is ensured by its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a tech firm," said Harvard Business School, a professor at IBM's book Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM - or "Big Blue," as it is popularly known for its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any U.S. tech firm and five of its employees won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include an ATM, a payment card, a financial swap, a barcode or a flash drive.
IBM with about $220 billion this year became the second largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), with Microsoft overtakeing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations have hit the tastes of customers and times - IBM, for example, failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, Prodigy online or IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t emotionally tie yourself to the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and when they don't work, leave them.
Unlike, for example, the rival Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM’s revenues are most involved in services, after about a fifth of them are software and hardware.
In 1990, with more than half of the share, it was the strongest representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding $15 billion worth of assets, and has invested $58 billion in purchasing prospective technologies over the same time.
Investment continues even since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept through the world for the first time.
IBM is acting on the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis unaffected.
The price of IBM shares has risen by 120 percent of the year since the beginning of 2008, the company's net profit is continuously rising.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything, only its values are not.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally having the intricate name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was not until 1924 that it was IBM’s name in 1924 – originally a brand used for the company’s subsidiaries in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was given by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technology such as the famous "stingers", i.e. hours recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the supervisory board of the company until 1930.
Flint hires the head of rival Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built an invinrazible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all sorts of machines for business - from meat and cheese slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson was in charge of the company, the turnover doubled to nine million dollars and the company’s extensive expansion into all continents began.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after almost forty years in the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, humans and computers from IBM helped NASA drive flights into space - Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "bath" that established the computer standard of the time, called IBM 5150, came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, while buying a consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote herself fully to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, the "smarter planets."
Its aim is to make smart use of technologies in previously even unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or city management.
For the business industry, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM ČR, it also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Headquarters is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dedicated to voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also the lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now she's not going to wait, and she's set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová gave Bartošová asylum in her home in the summer, she probably didn’t even dream how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved away from Říčany after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, reconciled to her husband's relationship, and now she even made his bid farewell forever.
The speedster doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with
If Rychtář and Bartošová had broken up once, his wife’s arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"It is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live up to his life in our common house, no one will expel him."
"But he will live to see him not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said, adding that she has already detached herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
Joseph's, the fact that Darina's back door was closed, meanwhile, doesn't mind.
"I respect the decision of the wife."
"I'm going to be with Iveta and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife has set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, property, I buy."
"Daria and I are talking quite normally, except that we don't share a bed," Rychtář told Blesk.
If Rychtářová also found a new love, she said she would not stop her.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he's going with and if he has a boyfriend.
I know that's my fault, I'm in love with Iveta and I take all responsibility," Josef concluded.
Worst Women's Habits: Do They Concern You?
If you ask men if they could name any typical female bad habits, as a rule, they all pour them very readily out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where there are several female bad habits that can perfectly pump men's blood in their veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to shop in stock on discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should tame their shopping passion at least a little bit.
But tell me, who could resist just walking around the clothes stores, looking for well-fitting uppers on tops and then trying them all (ideally in different colors) in the booth?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it can literally become a hell.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you in front of the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you even like me?"
Don’t they remind you of these sentences?
Isn't it?
Then you're one of those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their female partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more annoying the frequency of this complaining, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless merry-go-round.
Washing windows, vacuuming, mopping tiles, wiping dust, scrubbing the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on a dirty foot on a clean pavements, for getting dirty with a scrubbed sink and tagged a glass living room wall with which you had so much work to do?
If you suffer from this "diablinary", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not stand in the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can jeopardize your relationships and family well-being.
Digging
"Purchase the used shorts in the trash."
"You're going to wear old socks tomorrow, too?"
"The wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you dig into your partner several times a day, know that you can reliably dial him.
Of course you don't mean it bad, you want to make sure everything is okay.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to dig into them so much...
Gossiping, gossiping
For some women, they also own gossip, gossip, but also insulting and association against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things with each other such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release a small, harmless gossip or gourd here and there.
Hand on heart, it's your own to all women.
The opposite, however, are the gossip of the coarseest grain, which likes and often gossip, perhaps despise everyone and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the women's work collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped with assists to Philadelphia win
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr participated in Monday's NHL game with two assists on the Philadelphia 5:3 victory on Carolina's ice and is again at the head of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was named the best player of the match, benefited from the list of the thirty-nine-year-old star.
Jagr's teammate Jakub Voráček also scored two assists in the match.
After the match, Jagr told overseas journalists that he had predicted Giroux a big evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give him a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get that feeling," Jagr explained, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
Moments later, the team's second hit was a Czech track.
Voráček won a disc behind the Hurricanes goal and presented it between the circles of the scoring Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer was reduced in the weakening, but the lead of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Especially the Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr, he scored a third goal, then his shot melted through the flow in the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," Jagr praised his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning," Jagr added.
Carolina made the game a drama, a goal by Tuom Ruutu and again Dwyer, who made it through a penalty shootout, got the difference of one goal.
Another complication was not allowed by Matt Read, who ended the outnumbering two-on-one.
"He hit well in our pronger zone."
"Put the disc, I picked up the speed and (Read) rode to the far post."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play a match against Buffalo, in the second period he withdrew due to an injury in the upper body.
In addition to the experienced bek, the Candies lost a two-goal lead and lost after a penalty shootout 2:3.
One of their raids was not converted by Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than the lost points, was regretted by the extensive midfield of the back row, with the match playing only five defenders.
"It's wrong."
"We played the game with only one experienced player, the rest were the youngsters."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"The alternation after the alternation came at us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, to move the puck out of our zone."
In that we had gaps," added one of the defenders of P. K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty hits by Winnipeg to a 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals, who broke the five-game losing streak, were shared by five different scorers.
How the prices of tours have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in what was then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies overwhelmingly only sold tours to the countries of the Socialist Bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays to the sea to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea by the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was also possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime sided with the West and the journey of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia was subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely even within the socialist countries.
In the event that a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
At that time, travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand a queue overnight with a sleeping bag or have a "good aquaintances" in the travel agency.
But even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for trips to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so it was not possible to raise funds (the Western currency) for the trip to the West without a foreign exchange promise.
However, by far the most often Czechs spent their holidays in the Czech Republic, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that Czechs bought and this custom survives to this day.
The travel of Czechs has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is that it was not possible to travel freely to us for the most popular Croatia until 1989, as it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
In the early 90’s, the visa requirement was lifted to neighbouring Western European countries, which started a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria’s Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to see it at least for a while.
In Paris, for example, Czechs slept in parks in tents, because our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of the travel of Czechs at this time was to carry their own food, canned food, sausages, etc. in order to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, which was finally able to freely buy the western currency after many dans for years.
However, our standard of living and with that average salaries increased, resulting around 1997 at another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have regularly started preparing tours with charter flights since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper thanks to the possibility of arranging quantity discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 90's of the last century, Czechs already had visa-free travel to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the USA, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came in 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the first ever direct charter flight to exoticism was dispatched from the Czech Republic, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters fly with Czech tourists to warm far-flung countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100 thousand Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US abolished visas for Czech tourists and thus our country has definitely ranked among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history and spent more than 15 thousand on the first time in history, including the cost of the stay. CZK per person.
The General Meeting is to find the chairman, but again threatens the heel
Czech football is without a chairman for almost five months and there is a risk that Ivan Hašek’s successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement under which electoral rules will be followed.
Without it, it will not even start to vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hašek resigned in June and on his departure, he urged colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hašek, football slipped back to striving between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
It was fully demonstrated on September 16, when the new chairman was to be chosen.
Delegates of the General Meeting to the National House in Prague in Smíchov came unnecessarily, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just the method of election.
There was no agreement on who actually has the right to vote in the meeting - whether only statutory representatives, or even officials of the credentials of the power of attorney.
At this one point since then, there has been a partial consensus, which was also helped by the recommendation of the Institute for the State and the law, according to which representation on the basis of a power of attorney is not possible.
But the disputes still prevail over the electoral order.
Even the Executive Committee, which does not solve anything else at its meetings, whether proper or extraordinary, has not brought too clear to the situation.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in Round 3 to exclude the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairman of the FAČR, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the draft model in the third round, the candidate will win, which will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running.
Moravia is reportedly willing to go on a concession to win a candidate who gets a higher sum of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side is pushing for the condition that the winner must gain at least a two-thirds advantage in this percentage census.
"But then it would lose the meaning of the two previous rounds, that would completely deny the two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian Freedom Party, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the valid statutes.
Tomáš Paclík also somewhat surprisingly agrees with this, although it is estimated that the statute-determined electoral order suits Pelta the most of all candidates.
"I wish that the election is maximally according to the statutes."
"In order not to invent any representative nonsense as at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his statements he defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All the passions will be reassured by the eventual progress of the national team at the European Championship."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be more willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonec official, who has the greatest experience in managing football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very divided."
"It is not among the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations on purpose."
"This can cause the general meeting to be blocked again."
"But I hope that common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete for the match at all.
The aviation special, in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among others, the vice-chairmen of Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not fly out of Prague due to a technical malfunction in the morning and a replacement option was to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of the barracks retaliation.
In the end, a ministerial-level meeting may be decisive, which may occur allegedly on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to make divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to agree.
There is a lot in the game: the state subsidy, the credibility of football and also the forthcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will solve the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If the head of footballers in Pilsen, Tomáš Paclík, before an extraordinary general meeting, saw a strong candidate who would meet all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have claimed to fight for the top position.
"If a quality adept exists, I'm fighting for it and I don't go to the election."
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a thing," Paclík told the Czech News Agency.
In the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is driven by the motivation to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favorite of the elections, from trying to prevent him from heading the FACR.
Paclík also emphasizes that if he wins his victory, he would only last until 2013, when the general meeting is on the agenda.
In office, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not very connected with football events.
"I've spoken to some of the people who would come into consideration."
"It was crazy for me when some said they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment."
"I want to change that view," he said.
Paclík is said to be most bothered by Pelt's connection with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta should stand in a presiding position.
"If he wins, the current situation would be preserved and nothing would move forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berber, who is a proficient businessman, it would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelt's name years ago was heard in the wiretapping investigation of the corruption affair, from which Pelta came out without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would also look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is already taking his former statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman."
If Paclík triumphed in Thursday's election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, is also considering.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great powers."
"I could think of him as the head of representation."
"But he couldn't manage the association manager."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who attracted a lot of attention in September by saying that he was behind the dismissal of the referees' committee headed by Luděk Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík says he would dare to lead the association.
He refers to his skills from the management of private companies, and since last summer he has also been in charge of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated his first league triumph in May.
"I have the strength to make a difference in a football environment, to contribute to its certain cultivation."
"For limiting the influences of some interest groups, which may be influencing the disciplinary and appeals committee, which is treated until disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider the strengthening of the relations of the FAČR with the Czech Olympic Committee as one of the priorities, with which he would lobby the political leaders for getting more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"It's one of the key things the new president should do."
"If there is a tax on gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but frankly they have to say where the money will go," he said.
As a burden, Paclík now does not even take his connection with the Pilsen club, even though he himself claims that the chairman of the FACR should be "unstracidian".
Pelta is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl and Dukla in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't even see the sense of me hypocritically converting my shares in a Pilsen club to anyone and return there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FACR, which would exclude the electoral stalk
Two days before the General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairman, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would have to make sure that the FACR has new statutes that would definitively exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
Jablonec officials are optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly damp down the eventual success of the football team today.
Before the September elections, Pelta promised to concentrate on representing and raising funds if elected.
He decided to go to the election before the last general meeting at the last minute, so he could be useful for a two-month delay to defend his ideas about the management of football and present in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been making football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that it is high time for someone to lead the association," says the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who worked for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
That is why he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the choice is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Meeting, statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they did not allow various interpretations, we had the President since September," Pelta said.
It was the recast of the most important document of the civic association as a decoy to delegates.
"If I become chairman, I'll take it as a personal assignment and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," Pelta insists.
He said he is not trying to define himself against his opponents.
He has previously announced that he could imagine cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first vice-chairman.
For a long time he did not attack Tomáš Paclík, who, on the contrary, did not leave the thread dry on Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year, he's already gained some successes."
"His attacks, however, were undignified and a lot of people were taken aback by the way of election campaign."
"That's why many of them now doubt his true character," Pelta said, returning to the adversary's address, who is said to remain true to the proceptions he announced in September.
His strongest weapon, according to him, is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
It should be a showcase for football.
"And I would also try to end all the affairs, starting with the Bohemians case or the reverberations of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately afterwards, I would start a meeting with the private and state sectors to provide enough money for the whole football," the forty-six-year-old candidate told the Czech News Agency two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I would have to get acquainted with the content of the individual employees first," he said to Strahov, where there is an understandable nervousness from the long inopernish.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the forthm general meeting, they believe that on Thursday the delegates will not go to Nymburk unnecessarily.
"If the only point of contention is how it will be voted in the third round, then we can get over it."
“Football needs credibility, and it will only gain that by finally having a leader again,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before his career’s decisive day.
Rajchl promises that under him the FACR would start working hard
If the current Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl were elected the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday's General Meeting, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start to work hard.
It wants to push through systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Hašek began.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"Site from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I'm not saying that I'm doing everything myself," Rajchl told the Czech News Agency.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competencies in the Executive Committee so that each of the members devotes itself to a certain area."
"And I'm going to give hard-working tasks to keep football moving a mile step forward in every segment."
"It probably wouldn't make many people happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering running again.
"It's known to me that I do 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks under my feet and question my every step of mine," he explained, explaining why he hesitated.
"But a lot of people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Hašek.
"There's been a lot of work done over the last two years, and I don't want to throw it away right now."
"Throught are the processes that will have a reverberation in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation at the union could return to the time before Hašek.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"Behind him are, above all, people who would make football in such a way that it would be only for the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not that I'm partying someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will be well and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech chairman.
"Even though some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league."
"This would not have happened in the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclík was also involved in the fight for the chairmanship, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-president and sees that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, considering saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating TV contracts and negotiating a lottery law to be his achievements.
On the contrary, it is a compene that the union does not pull together.
While he declares that he is "disqualified by returning trust to Czech football", the second of Paclík's opponents considers a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can dispute that he has done a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he were elected, he would perhaps continue the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not change the staffing in the commissions in any way."
"He wouldn't want to twist it to his advantage," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
Julia Stanek
A paddling pool from the perspective of a UFO, a sumptuous pool in Budapest: Who travels through Europe, can experience their blue miracle - and after exploring cities or traveling let your tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show where the wellness by the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on discovery journeys in the past one and a half years, her luggage was not to be missed: her swimsuit.
Lying on the water, looking up to the height of artistically formed domes, swam opposite the marble putti (attach of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pool.
If she liked any swimming pool, she had in an instant she had her in her notebook, even with remarkable details of the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have explored the architectural historian Meder in this way and presents them now in his just-released book "Badefreuden (Radity of Bathing) ": Folksrooms in Munich, the historic palaces of the swimming pools in the Black Forest,"The hard core of concrete structures" in Taunus.
13 countries led it by her "Journey to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm for swimming culture.
The sport doesn't exert it much, says Meder - it's just something else in the water.
To anger, it's just that fans of swimming have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners for health can inhale the intoxicating smell of spruc bements or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
“One day I asked why the swimming pool must always be so ugly,” says the living Lady Meder.
"So I started collecting nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Splashing in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the coziness factor is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the floats can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of floor, a person has a water surface in the spa."
"It is both transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: a high vault, a colorful tile, jumping boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (Radity from Bathing) " provides on 190 pages everything that needs to know about the architectural and cultural history of historical oases wellness - but it mainly arouses the desire to jump in the blue.
The remarkable specimens were discovered by the collector of the swimming farms Mrs. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing spa, like the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, she found water containing nitrates in the original karst cave (cave spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a beautiful spectacle. While a man has an entire city in the Zurich roof swimming pool in his eyes, the outdoor pool of the spa in St. Anton to look at the snow-covered Arlberg - a: In the steam room there is a window from which it is possible to monitor the bustle on the ski slope.
The most remarkable pool design is expected to be spa guests in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Aquapark looks like an ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
From the three upwards of the open pans in winter, steam rises while standing in the back of the Ötztal mountain.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool collector, Mrs. Meder, the smell of chlorine climbed into the nostrils.
Many thermal baths are smelled after sulphur, in the spa Árpad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells of heating oil to the extent that one can hardly believe that he has reached the spa treatment.
The smell comes from healing water containing alkaline bicarbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, one place was also disappointed by Iris Meder during his search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, the proposed spa was closed by architect Dušan Jurkovič.
As Lady Meder looked at the thundering windows of the red-and-white-yellow Art Nouvel building, she saw the weeds between the tiles growing massively.
They were detonated, on the other hand, in the magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: in the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildback.
These baths have already completed three phases of construction; one can discover not only the Neo-Romanesque elements that date back to its time in 1844, but also the Moorish Hall in the style of the Alhambra style, which was attached around r. 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been the popular spa spot of the connoisseur of the pools Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because he comes from the Black Forest.
“It’s already some kind of performance to combine such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex,” says Ms. Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool is probably a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank Investigate Trade in Commodities
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann tasked the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the head of the group wants to draw consequences from this.
Hamburg -
The matter is clear to federal citizens: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, that banks speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of those inquired to even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this trade because it deepens the problems in the world.
This is the result of the Forsa poll on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study relies on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-Ocateurch.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive prices high and banks therefore carry co-operation on the world problem of hunger.
The Consumer Protection Campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity betting was meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that participants in the capital market interested in high-risk trades have detached themselves from supply and demand - and made profits to the poorest account.
Except for competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to examine the complaints and said that no trade "work is worth having the good reputation of Deutsche Bank being put on a bet."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is auditing the rebuke of foodwatch-Report.
The control is to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - along with a recommendation on how to handle it.
At the end of January, the bank's representatives want to tell the consequences they will draw.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works on his image by himself.
Foodwatch chief, Thilo Bode, welcomed the report, but also infuriated his criticism of the financial sector: “Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are today detrimental to the general welfare.”
Let Ackermann, as the highest bank lobbyist, live up to the duty.
"Deutsche Bank must cut all items for which money is used for bets on food prices," Bode said.
"Indifferent whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Group boss would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors would not go to the supervisory board otherwise than planned.
By averting disputed agrarian speculation, it could improve its image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - that's what his successor should eventually handle.
Every second would denounce the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have been involved in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a poll in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Accordingly, eleven percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments with which bets on food prices are associated.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they knew their bank was involved in such transactions: Every second would denounce all investments where the money flows into speculation with raw materials as a result of the poll.
43 percent would warn acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about shutting down their account and switching to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and a happy ending: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and desolate.
It is now open again as an exhibition house.
When it is mountainous for modern post-war architecture, for bright forms, glass halls, bold booms and new building materials that are typical for the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karel Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels is an apt and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and powerful steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect famous for building the Austrian pavilion during the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus as a key, he finally became internationally famous in Munich in 1973.
His temporary exhibition building was placed in Schweizer Garten near the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Railway Station), reconstructed and in 1962 the Museum of the 20th century - it was named as the "House of the 20th Century".
However, the building was not suitable for the museum, nor spatially or technically - the walls for hanging artistic exhibits were missing, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art was given a new booth in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and decayed more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischantitz has reconstructed the pavilion, now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
A new beginning was made by Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a graduated art historian with an eminent career, m. j. in her youth figure skater, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of Musea Moderna Salzburg, she strongly enforced the reconstruction of politicians and conservationists, acquiring public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and bookstore should be created, and an office building had to be built for it.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischangitz was then an ideal cast for execution.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him, where he "almost every weekend" viewed exhibitions.
He knew the original project and he also knew the problems of the building, which, when relocated to Vienna and the change of use, lost its generosity and lightness.
During the reconstruction, there were far greater problems: the building was a "catauper for energy", says Krischantitz.
The profiles of the glass facade were replaced by glass fiberglass reinforced insulating glass and glass roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Cool bridges-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were remedied.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, the recessed lighting canal between the building and the street provides lighting, the entrance leads the bridge - almost a new building, but still a noble Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown color tone.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the heritage office and the low budget.
"Ofty had to be found material that is good and inexpensive and also liked the heritage office," says Krischitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-historicalism".
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "buy proper self-confidence".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, as an urban happy accident happened: In the circle around the Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City Quarter near the Main Railway Station" with office and residential houses is being created.
And perhaps another happy coincidence will happen: The 21st-century House could receive support from another Krischantitz building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as can be heard, he is already negotiating with the city about the neighborhood at the Schweizer Garten site.
The track is planning a package for the winter crisis in a million-dollar amount
The runway has snatched a crisis plan to prevent train shortages in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It will cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train shortages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing more than 70 million euros in the newspaper this year, according to a report in newspapers.
The "Bild" newspaper brought preliminary reports, citing an internal group plan that a total of around 300 million euros would be expected to be invested in 2015.
It is said to be achieved better use of trains and rail networks also in extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the number of internal and external employees to 16 000 people to remove snow on railway installations and platforms.
The aim is to deprive the platform until the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches over the course of four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the Rüdiger Grube railways warned after a meeting at the highest level with representatives of the government and industry against train outages and delays also during this winter.
In the last winter, the passenger transport track had significant problems, because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions it had a lack of reserves.
Thus, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railway Authority.
In addition, delays in the dispatch of ICE trains
For years, the railway has also failed to manage that it must have to have the axles of ICE trains more often controlled when one ICE train at Köln Central Station was destroyed.
Deutsche Bank pays million-dollar fine in the US
After the fuss overhead Josef Ackermann, new trampolines are taking place in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar compensation there.
As if Deutsche Bank had no problems at home, the giant in the industry has caught up with his past in the US: the Frankfurt institution pays $145 million in one compensatory procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage certificates.
The NCUA financial market regulator blames a number of large banks for settling cooperative banks with fake promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost their value considerably during the crisis and brought the banks into the abyss with them.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the need to drag the parties to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank does not admit any guilt by settling.
This is also true for Citigroup, which is committed to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the helpfulness of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. Co-operative banks and assists in bankruptcy to protect customer receivables.
The NCUA is attempting to obtain compensation for billions of dollars in damages.
The settlements are now the first of their kind.
The regulator also clamped himself to other big banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
For dubious mortgage certificates, it is so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American bubble around real estate in r. 2007 burst, it has become fatal to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed their minds.
Although the events occurred a few years ago, there is now a sharp wind blowing to the banks in the list.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to bring about redress or to be misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It criticizes 18 international big banks for two state-owned U.S. wealth financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to double the mortgage trading of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank, too, has to face a FHFA lawsuit, with more trades worth about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority demands that the Frankfurt Institute be responsible for "substantial losses", without specifying any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in IBM IT enterprise.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, a major U.S. investor Warren Buffett has always claimed that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies will only be difficult to predict.
Now, however, he has read IBM's business reports and changed his opinion about investment in the industry.
Much earlier, he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for IT-separation of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered to be knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, the motherly rock of the IBM IT is now allowed to be called "Sir IBM".
For Buffett revealed at US economic radio station CNBC that he bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
Its investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became IBM's largest shareholder with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett sagte that even IBM knew nothing about his involvement.
He praised the management, which even tried to make proper returns during the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT-services for a long time, such as the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to this day.
He claims to invest only in businesses whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight rail, the lubricant manufacturer or machine products.
In addition to about 80 subsidiaries, his Berkshire Hathaway Group also owns shares in a number of large-scale companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old gentleman took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60's and built one of the most valuable businesses in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha (The Miracle of Omaha".
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's shares rose by one percent before the stock market began.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, the world's most valuable technology companies.
But at Microsoft, so many Buffett, he wouldn't want to play.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be his confusing friend.
Threat is tangible
After the revelation of the "Bunks in Zwickau", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish descent and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany, fear and worry has been responded to this news.
For many German Turks, this brings back the ghost, which has long been considered dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background.
There was never any doubt that there is xenophobia in Germany.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a scale whose dimension can no longer be seen.
"Really reviving the bloody ideology?" was the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturrk".
The newspaper "Sabah," on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the Constitutional Protection Unit and fear that the German authorities could also be entangled in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted deliberately: Over the weekend, it recalled by a demonstration of silence in front of the Brandeburg Gate of Victims of Racist Violence.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, recalled the festive act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a life together was staged - as a history of success.
As a field here is the news of several Turkish media: "Germany's gift for the 50th birthday" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murderous series.
Also, the issue of the newspaper "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be taken so that this connection does not make this thought connection.
"The headline is starting to stink," is the headline of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He emphasizes that people who paid taxes were murdered and their work brought an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The most critically discussed in the German-Turkish internet forums is the procedure of the police and its late success in the search.
Why the German authorities did not think much earlier to search for the suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are at least rhetorically ready for the use of drastic means: "If the activity continues to be carried out here so superficially, immigrants will be left with nothing but their own defense and armed."
"That's probably the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network very strongly depends very strongly on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means, if internal peace in Germany is threatened, clarifies the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burnt bollard in Solingen is deeply etched into the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown the living Turks more clearly, that there is a tangible threat and the Germans, that mistrust and distance may result in right-wing violence
But the assassinations made the Turks a more apparent sense of reciprocity on the side of the Turks.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
At the time, the Turkish press was criticized mainly by the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a mouthful telegram to the Turkish state president, but he allowed himself to be represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech at the time in his speech, calculated what fees the Turkishs were handing over.
Quite as if the value of a person were measured according to the height of his taxes.
The current news of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local state law order is.
In addition to efforts to broadly clarify and re-evaluate right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time this time requires open words.
Scandalous bank at Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank of Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered almost bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has since been gliding from one crisis to the next.
Now some German is supposed to compare it.
That's what Axel Weber didn't think.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, he became known in July to take on an almost equally spectacular new job: the president of the board of directors of the Swiss big bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative move in his career.
Axel Weber was looking forward to it publicly, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and said friendly remarks towards future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turnaround."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it was clear that everything would turn out very differently.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and wasted about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland-respected banker, had to leave.
The president of the UBS board has since been scalded - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that the Weber can advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May - not only in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he would certainly need a time to work in.
At one time, he will take responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which has just once proved once again that it deserves the title of "Bank of the Biggest Scanates in Europe"
For UBS is enormous – until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world – and it has been slippery for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, the Swiss bank will not be spared.
It started during the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS enjoyed excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid, but also cunning asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: It also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed more wealthy clients on the one hand with $1.6 trillion than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it advanced to the league of the world's largest banks
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time prospect of banking at Zurich, tells us: “I always cited UBS as a model of a good bank to my students at the time.”
"From today's point of view, one asks: How could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first obvious that something had gone wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, the head of the board, Peter Wuffli, who has so far been considered a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker, resigned.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank's investment division wasted subprime-papers and had to write off billions.
To make this happen, UBS announced a capital increase of really 13 billion francs.
On the other hand, she actually found investors, but those over which it would recently turn its nose up: An opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first crash.
In April 2008, it developed worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second highest-paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: due to its flawed investments, UBS was behind the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation put six billion francs into mandatory currency bonds, for which it could have become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - for it has noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
“We wouldn’t be able to save UBS again,” says Geiger, a banking expert.
The second one follows the first catastrophe.
For several months now, UBS has capitulated in a tax dispute with America and showed a willingness to release the data of wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of banks, cut taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return to unauthorised profits from these deals, including a fine mark-up.
This has made UBS more or less open about helping to cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: a halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking seceipt was no longer what it had been before.
This was followed by the resignation of the head of the board of directors and the president of the board of directors.
And an exodus of customer money.
Thus, over the course of a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in asset management for aiding to tax cuts.
And just when it calmed down a bit, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, this unfortunate business anabasis is coming: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it is clear: with the risk management in investment banking, it is still not working.
“The case of Adoboli probably found that the risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and Finanz professor of finance at the Zürich University’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a major German bank is also confident: "The problem with UBS is that it cannot handle risk control."
After all, it was exactly the idea of caution that Swiss bankers had started a long time ago to become the guards of the world’s great assets: no too big risks, but security for money – the world has also collapsed on this side of the Alpine republic.
The Swiss banks’ vaults have become a symbol for unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still suitable for the Clichiff of a good Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
The position is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in the Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Zurich Lake, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rental of shops is among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops as a patisserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank through the Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside are walls lined with marble, in front of them stands massive leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large signpost to the "sejfu".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
However, the Swiss bank’s two Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse have sometimes been suppressed or betrayed by the head of a small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, eventually closing, like all Swiss bankers, also with both big banks, deals.
UBS has probably gotten too big, it's finding - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have expanded.
The Swiss probably have nothing more to say about it.
"And if they were to adapt to Anglo-Saxon ways long ago."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that UBS changed, at first generated high profits, and then a disaster: No European financial institute has lost as much money in the Subprime jungle as the Schweizer Großbank.
15. October 2008 the disaster was obvious.
“On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small seven-million-strong country has decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation,” writes Lukas Hässig in his book, “Der UBS-Crash.”
Up to 68 billion francs or around €45 billion were approved by politicians to save a big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks merged into the massive concern.
A bank was formed that was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
At the same time, it helped that both different bank predecessors of UBS were complemented by: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a center of gravity in the management of assets and poorer but internationally heavily involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money with which they could spin a great roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 the head of the UBS Group and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of the future,” says Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble one who knows a lot about the models and statistics and Ospel, a man following the feelings around the stomach, who has evolved from banking science completely up."
But Ospel was said to have relied on Wuffli towards the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He probably thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
The right thing to do is: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly recall the executive meetings at which Wuffli Group Chief repeated the same slogan: To knock Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She listed "League Tables," a waiting list documenting the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS tried to place at the top.
A few steps she was already successful.
In the trade in foreign exchange and stocks, she participated in the game at the very top.
But the business advisers who were commissioned emphasize one weakness: In international interest-to-interest, in the language of bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close that gap, UBS decided to embark on an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hunger-of-warranty for growth, both the bank itself and its established fund to hedge risks in U.S. Subprime investments have invested.
It developed into a massive machine that repackaged the securities on U.S. mortgage loans and passed on - but it also kept the risks themselves.
Also, when other banks were looking for a way out.
“July in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying,” says banking expert Geiger.
How much euphoria is, a deep fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
The position at UBS became a catapult seat and to this day they swing.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
They have to find a strategy for the bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: The end of investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to go down heavily, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was understood only as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with his predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has asserted himself: He has long run UBS, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its condition in the mid-1990s.
3500 seats cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is her?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking.
Publicly, however, he only says that she and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

Europe will probably not recover from the recession so quickly, moreover, there are other signs of the weakness of banks.
The legend of investing Warren Buffett only confirmed the outlook: He said in a CNBC-interview that it would probably not be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
Therefore, from his point of view, it is probably too early to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the centuries-old principle and entered the U.S. tech industry.

Smart Crows Expand in Cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": But these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been part of the image of the city for centuries, yet in some villages there are complaints of the inhabitants to the dirt and noise caused by animals.
At the same time, there is no means in sight of "problem birds" so far.
Field ravens probably can no longer be expelled from the cities, experts at the first symposium on crows in Easter, Easter, said.
There, experts from all over the Federal Territory on possible starting points were consulted.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature conservationists also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected ravens of fields: The use of chemistry in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing buildings and felling of typical trees to nesting birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are, among others, in the Westphalian of Soest, Northwest, including in Yever, Diepholz and Achhim near Bremen and Leere.
There, 2005 controversial project of mass killing of crows in a rural district caused negative headlines.
The critics called the capture of animals in traps for birds and the killing of sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, shying, does not bring anything," the urban planner and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer found so much.
Removing nests by spraying water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies are splitting and dividing into other places."
Ethwarm is only conceivable as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem of the cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leera.
Considerable is the combination of exalting animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle in other places.
"Information board instead of chainsaws" was promoted by the psychologist and ethnographer Uta Maria Jürgens for the sake of completely different treatment of animals: "One body in the face we can eventually withstand self-confidence."
Ms. Jürgens co-founded the educational crows of the Ascherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, on which information boards provide lessons on the life of a highly intelligent field ram.
In the meantime, the project is already accepted by tourists.
Also, on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds, Mrs. Jürgens had her own opinion: "Here's every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Field ravens do not only use tools to reach a treat, but even make their instrument as an aid.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested behavior on four ravens of field as far as the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must cause the structure to bring to the larvae of the pier.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning Crows had to solve a more difficult problem.
In the vertically built reel, researchers placed a tiny jar with a mole larva.
By beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
But the researchers put pieces of wire there.
From them she shaped all four animals a hook, with the help of which she hunted the container as a cloth from the pipe.
Three of the four field ravens managed to do this even with a jam.

A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities in shooting at a long distance and with a hit from 25 meters adjusted to 2:0.

Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
In the end, judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding stood in the centre.
After the crackdown on Helder Postig in Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.).
On the opposing party, Stark made a questionable penalty kick after the Fabio Coentra action, which Misimovic confidently converted.
But after the break, everything was clarified by the European vice-champion from r. 2004 with four shots.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
With that, the European champion leaves r. 1976 for the fifth time in a row at the European Championships.
Team coach Michal Bilek with the legionnaire of the Bundesliga Michael Kadleec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the initial stage.

Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the turn from the border of the penalty area only close to the Czech goal.
After the break, the transverse crossbar had to save the place of the already knocked down goalkeeper of the world class, again lowering the striker FC Soul (50.).
The goal finally cleared everything up shortly before the end.

Selcuk Inan hit in the seventh minute with a shot from distance only by a pole, the striker Kazim also could not hang the deflected ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia took more control.
Also after the interruption, the Croats did not get the goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, which released Ivan Perisice of Dortmund from the 62nd minute, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also in action.
Trapattoni rides at the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.

Constantine Vassilev (57th) equalized for the guests.
Ireland set pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute for Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment was the Estonian defense prevented a possible leading goal.
In the 32nd minute, it was quite a long way away.
After the failed defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to 1:0.

Massacre on a personal level
The Emotionally Strong New Book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, Begins with such a long list of performing characters that your head turns dizzy.
One piece of advice on how to behave at the moment: Carefully rip out this page and make a bookmark.
You will get to know all of them in Mr. Englund’s novel story and this list will serve you as a navigation – as a kind of lighthouse – in moments when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "anti-historical work".
It contains several well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates about tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, but rather a "book about what it was like." It mainly deals with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"beauty and grief" combines the war experiences of 20 fewer dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricad, from female and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives are flames like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the tangle of destinies, while others extinguish.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classic historical novels.
It adjusts the notion that the First World War was only about the horrific trench battles on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with the fact that bees' nests fall on them, have to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or struggle with the presence of flies tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning, it is a very touching read.
The war will devour people's lives like some kind of natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpox.
When shooting from guns starts to sound in the distance and you are a woman who is at home with her children, run away or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the whole war was unleashed.
"Vakium arising from the lack of facts," Mr. Englund noted, "was filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from biographies, letters and other materials already published.
The descriptions of their lives may sound frightening and engaging, but by incorporating small moments and details, they are completely vivid and believable.
Many of them deal with hardship and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Preserves, all over the substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, imitation of aluminum, imitation rubber, paper dressings, wooden knobs."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
Mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with a fake bone of wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes with wooden soles".
He mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes for the production of sausages and 511 registered substitutes for coffee".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds inner impulses to wildness and brutality, whereupon he declares about the war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable armchairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper, or a good book, and pretend that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbarian hiding behind the starchy self.”
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon, and no one will even notice it, let alone mourn.
"When one finally accepts the fact that you are sacrificing, at least he would expect to do so in front of the grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convict whom he secretly hangs."
Other remarks relate to the departure of old Europe and the rise of new horrors.
"The conflict became more and more economic competition and a competitive struggle," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a bespoke-cutting dress that carries out his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, wickedness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some venereal disease from prostitutes to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the gonococo pus trafficking that soldiers bought and fought the genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate people rubbed him into their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is brisk, but not flamboyed, which is perfect for his human theme.
In the dozens of small outcomes, it captures the way the war "unleashed completely unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about the First World War, most of the time, rather than complex narrative, worked with hints, such as the "World War I First and Modern Remembrance" by Paul Fussel, or novels such as "On the Western Front Quiet" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming ending that is unparalleled in popular science literature.
But I won't tell you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, snatched the page from the list of heroes from your hand and lit it.
After a previous mistake this time for a minute, a precisely planned raid
Hundreds of police officers took part in it, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park should be almost empty by that time.
No one knew about the action except a few high-ranking officers. The others were first told that this was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence stressed how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
There were no recurrence of cases from recent weeks, for example, the use of pepper sprays against protesters, thereby violated the rules of the department and, moreover, the wave of public sympathy spilled over to the side of the squatters.
That is why the police operation aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park from the protesters was started only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders were inspired by operations taking place in other cities.
A massive exercise in case of crisis-situations behavior took place in the Randalls Island section, which was a preparation for the event at Zuccotti Park.
Leading officials have intensified so-called riot suppression training - anti-terrorist measures involving the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - with a focus on the city district of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" said, to whom the event was originally explained only as "execution".
"I know a few police officers who have also been called to this action, and no one has said to them that they are going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that he remains anonymous.
"The only highest-ranking members of the department knew about going to Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson the city had already received once.
14. On October, the city officials planned to clean the park, but then retreated from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them flocked to the park before the start of the operation.
Tuesday's event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around the neighborhood - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with a higher level of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people come to the park during the day, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there will be as few people as possible in the park," he said.
Before the troops set off, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The lights and recorded news roaring from the amplions frightened many protesters.
When the members of the riot units entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many protesters packed their belongings and left.
Police say they did not touch a single tent until 1:45 in the morning, which meant to give the protesters time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering on the edge of the park so they could enter it if any arrests had to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Chief Police Officer Paul J. Browne claimed it was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and in addition, some police officers treated them rudely.
Mr. Browne claimed that the TV cars on Church Street leading along the western border of the park could easily be filmed without any problems.
Police were advancing in the western direction and intertwined with the dense tangle of the protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes. Behind them went teams from the sanitary ward, which immediately raked everything left in the park.
Some of the protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documenting image materials appeared on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The most heavily stagnant group of protesters took refuge in the kitchen in their campsite, which lay near the center of the park.
Some created a roadblock and the police began their methodical arrests.
About ten people at the centre of the campsite tied together.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were called to cut the locks.
There were no arrests until 3:30 a.m. in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police statement read.
Mr. Browne said approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of "organization of riots and resisting arrests," he clarified.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer at the department.
Phil T also participated in the operation. Pulaski, the commander of the detectives at the department.
Mr Kelly was present, but "He didn't participate in the operation," Mr Browne said.
The second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it had to be called in.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, roadblocks were erected.
Of these places, the police then unfurled the protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
Police officers were spotted at one of them, many of whom were fitted with shields, pushing people even further beyond that border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around five o'clock in the morning, a protester south of Pine Street was spotted, jumping on the bonnet of a police car, and several others who were draining the air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood came out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
Auxiliary Workers' Union to Sued the City for Redevelopment
Unions representing hundreds of school auxiliaries who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday. He argues that the redundancies were not necessary and, moreover, it was discrimination, due to the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The court is probably the last option left by the unions in the District Council 37 region in their efforts to reverse the layoff decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees lost their jobs, who were among the city's lowest-paid staff. Their dismissal was described by the union leaders as retaliation of the city for not allowing him access to the health care fund managed by work crews last spring, with the help of which the city wanted to seal a hole in the budget.
City officials have categorically denied the allegations.
At the meeting of the city council held last month, Education Minister Dennis M. said. Walcott that the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the board immediately countered that the budget was not specifically talked about the dismissal of auxiliary workers.
Representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Department of Education that they would sue it. They will call a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce a lawsuit at the Manhattan Supreme State Court.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight laid-off workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, and therefore she would not comment on the individual allegations.
According to the proposal for a complaint that managed to obtain the New York Times, the unions focused on the number of dismissed in poor parts of the city, thereby seeking to support their claims of unfair conduct. They are of the opinion that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funds.
They point out that while in the schools in the Staten Island part were not released at all and in the Upper East Side part only minimally, in Brooklyn, in the District 23 section in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs, and in parts of District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, 46 assistants were released.
Five of the eight assistants lost their jobs at the Public School 36 in Harlem, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: "This is not a neighborhood of full wealthy parents who can procure funds to settle the deficit in the budget."
The budget of the School of Public School 36 was down 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way bonuses are calculated for each perbbee student.
The unions argue, among other things, that high school principals may have been confused in a way that has been written a document approving the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The word "excess" was used in the document to describe the action, i.e. to abolish the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the payroll of the school to the database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been dismissed," the complaint's proposal reads, "and not just moved to the database to the position of available workers."
Mission is over, Congress is ready to accept agreement on Libya situation
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
But before this happened, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of the United States troops has ceased.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Commission will decide on the comments supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which she should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and thank the American troops for "brackishness."
"With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both parties to the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may look innocent, but no debate about Libya has been easy until now.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both sides have constantly argued with each other and the White House about the wording of a number of declarations for approval or, conversely, the rejection of the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing limited use of the U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the Chamber of Deputies because of the differing views of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would halt the financing of U.S. operations in Libya.
This found the US mission in Libya literally in the legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama manages the mission, but its members clearly did not irritate it enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The hetter of the congress was eventually overtaken by other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli and 20 in August. He was killed in October by Gaddafi.
Mission Nato officially ended 31. October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the Commission for International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity that they have spent in an effort to liberate their people" and "praises men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies, who engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal gain the full support of the Commission on International Relations, or will the legisritors again be divided into two halves, as was the case when approving the June proposal?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican Party in the Commission.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday he had not seen the final version of the new proposal.
In the House, there will be a vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on the budget or other topic on which the entire House or Senate will vote.
For the time being, despite considerable efforts, the other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution, which were presented in the congress and touched a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are just minor variations of others.
In the House alone, you can find at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budget Supplement and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending."
Some of the proposals are identical, but their proponents - especially budding Republicans who want to improve their reputation - may boast of their "authorship."
The decree on budget regulation, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the balance sheet on the balance sheet.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss the limits of the number of periods in which members of the Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods allowed to be president.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of additions that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains an amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage as well as an amendment prohibiting the burning of the national flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be annulment if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress appear to be very active in designing various additions, they do not significantly deviate from the average compared to previous years.
At 111. They offered Congress 77 amendments, while at 100. There were 66 Congress.
Their activity even fades compared to the early 90's of the 20th century, when, according to statistics from the Senate library, members offered more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment, which was added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Breeched, but not defeated," Gifford says in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was injured at point-blank range by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with a melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow," and said she was more at stake in her recovery.
Giffords appeared on the show "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. It was obvious that the creation of sentences still caused her problems and needed help when walking.
The whole show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary for the injury caused by a bullet that pierced her skull in front, penetrated the left half of her brain and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to triumphantly take part in a vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, the forty-one-year-old Giffords replied: "It's quite good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the "20/20" episode, which aired on the eve of the new book of this couple, titled "Gabby: A Tale of Courage and Hope."
The special followed the entire reunification of Gifford since the January 8 shooting.
In the videos made by Kelly during the first week, Giffords can be seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can’t do more at the time than she can’t get one or two fingers up.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair, and therapists are teaching her how to perform simple activities.
Nodding head.
The lip-suppression.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word, "toast," when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show that music played the pivotal role for the recovery of Giffords: the Congresswoman sings on them together with a therapist on melodies to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, revealed to Sawyer that she doesn't remember anything about the day the shooting occurred.
Her husband said Gifford read newspaper articles about the shooting on March 12, when she first asked him who the six who were killed in the incident.
The shooting is suspected by Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held at a prison in Missours, where, under the influence of forcibly administered drugs, is awaiting trial.
"A lot of people have died," Giffords said.
"Very, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point his wife said during the recovery, "I lost."
"So I said to her right away, 'Gabby, you didn't lose, 'Kelly said.
"You just got a beating.
But you can do it, you get together and come back even stronger than ever.”
Military units encounter compassion rather than respect
The event was a gala on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, frustration, and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines gathered around him.
The festively dressed crowd rose up and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who held the spring benefit.
The evening was also attended by the then chairman of the Committee of the Chiefs of Staff. In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was on the scene, but he saw the role of military units somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as some orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers thought it well.
I know I do.
But what I saw was not respect. It was pity.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes glorifying the American public.
The army is insurmounted in the praise for its victims.
But this praise costs something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if it has pity individuals in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to army commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil the public relations they serve.
They also realize that the anger that troops returning from Vietnam had to face was much worse.
As a result, most of the words of regret are spoken quietly and in private among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat actions where they served as Marines, their father warned them that their service would be viewed outside the military from two angles.
From the point of view of some, they will feel respect and amazement, as they defeated the enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
But he'll be wondering if there's "a bad, violent veteran hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took a seat in Washington's government when he returned.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who interviewed him were indisputably suggesting whether he could resist the stress involved in Washington work so soon after returning to fighting.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The concern of the army partly stems from American indifference to wars.
Successes in the battlefield are rarely recognized in a country that has little awareness of its own army and finds little of its own benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as usual during World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition from politicians and the public is mainly focused on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the extent of their injuries.
Army Faces Growing Pressure to Hit Rape Hard
This week, it will be decided whether the trial of 28 women and men against the military will begin due to alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other appellants are ready to bring the lawsuit.
The soldier of the first class of Elizabeth Lyman was at the night when she was allegedly raped by her colleague in the army, 25 years old and was at 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at the Miramar Air Force, north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she came across her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if he could join her, that they could drink a little in her room.
"The warning light came on in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I could listen to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, the man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will await the verdict of the hearing, which could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be put on trial.
The accusation said Gates and Rumsfeld have failed to fight the spread of rapes in the military, contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charges were filed by Washington law firm Susan Burke in February, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. Over the coming months, however, their number has grown to 28-25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military, and that the military failed to investigate, punish and any pursuit of justice after the announcement of these attacks.
Burke claims to be at the hands of the highest-ranking army commanders, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent the efforts to implement measures against such acts? The High Command."
Burke also claims to have contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of further lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the allegations in this case - she stacked all the eggs in one basket, as she herself says - she will file lawsuits in multiple different cases if necessary so that the pressure does not subside.
A team defending the Defense Department is led by U.S. prosecutor Neil MacBride, who, together with his collaborators, has filed an initiative to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek discuss in detail the defense strategy - in principle, the fact that current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the wounds they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the wounds suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document reads.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is only a wording: in modern wars it is difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In both the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women's soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the field of communication with civilian women occurring in the war zone.
The result: between these wars, 150 female soldiers were killed - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
The time has come for modernization in the military, Burke explains.
She is not alone in her fight. In addition, three other attorneys are dealing with the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the veteran's legal services seminar prepare a lawsuit against the four main military academies for the supposed development of an atmosphere promoting hatred of women.
Independently of this, the non-profit organization of American Vietnamese veterans is collecting the basis for its lawsuit against the military. The lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of a "personality disorder" that was allegedly detected in the victims of rape, so that the military has a pretext for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women's Action Network, this is a perfectly common practice.
In December, her group filed a motion of a lawsuit against a state organization for conduct dealing with veterans, which it accuses of discriminatory practices to take place in processing requests for help from persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were tabled in Congress, which were tabled by a group of senators and deputies from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Defense Department's Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence, 3 158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attacks remains unannounced in most cases, and according to Pentagon estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in the year.
In a report issued in March, the rate of prosecution of suspects is also analyzed: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military - half of the civil justice system, reached trial.
Prosecutors, in the case of Deputy Burke, describe the attacks only as the first of a number of traumas.
Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape of military police less than an hour after it was due to occur.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to various members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the attacker was found in her bed - from the wound she had made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman received a hearing on trial, during which she was asked questions about whether she made her love with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned, who, as witnesses of the reputation, testified in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually accuseatic of guilt.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," Lyman says.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there on the spot - I screamed out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, 'That wasn't his judgment. He was mine.”
Lymans ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, calling her unfit to serve.
In January 2010, she was unbeemed from the army and therefore without entitlement to leave.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other accusers moves to the next stage or not, it is a long-distance run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law.
Of course, he notes, "O From my point of view, they should be able to advance to the next stages of the hearing."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment it saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of Feres Doctrine.
The army has been behind for several decades because their duties do not give up to the same level of motivational stimuli and deterrent means.
He adds: "Chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
There will only be a change when good people are willing to fight.
Unless the hearing is decided in their favour, Burkevo, a lawyer for the plaintiff, will gather hundreds of other persons ready to bring up the lawsuit and begin to work on other cases concerning the subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue, from where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, depending on what comes first.
Walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to a July murderous rampage left in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social media sites.
After this summer, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easily - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them is not really that hard at all," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by a British research team on European digital populism.
Facebook’s personal information supply is so extensive, Bartlett says it was enough for scientists to simply use the site’s advertising and, with absolute precision, identify the demographics wanted—something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe has found half a million fans of right-wing groups, whereupon they focused their attention and sent them ads. However, instead of inviting them to a newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they called on them to fill out a questionnaire in which questions were about the level of their education, the relationship to violence and optimism given their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"This is a whole new way to conduct research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, which is irritated by an increasing level of immigration.
But on the other hand, "threes who combine their online activism even with offline activism are more sensible, democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything, from health issues to social trends that hide state updates, walls posts, and pressed "Like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. On average, each of them provides three different data on average, which makes this social network literally a "information supernova" that is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works in the name of which the word Facebook is found has risen to almost 800% compared to five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"Previously, when you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go sideways, but you'd never let go," Bartlett says.
"This is all broken down by Facebook - you just go straight to them."
Others say the site can offer a way to identify a social-health problem and avoid it.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who dismantled their drunken outputs on Facebook were far more at risk of alcoholism problem than students who were silent about the subject.
Morenová suggests that student peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who posts too many drunken statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved if you can't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and director of the Center for Health, Conduct and Development of Children at the Seattle Children's Health, Development Center.
"We've found a way to identify at-risk children that we wouldn't otherwise have a chance to discover."
Facebook is constantly probing its users’ data.
The information team of the site has developed statistics on the context of relations statuses and the day of St. Valentine's Day, voter turnout in 2010 and the coefficient of satisfaction of the nation (mainly using the information they had access to - proponents of Internet freedom have long argued that the site should make its information treasure accessible to others for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the ability to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information to the site.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect offline data. However, the on-line data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users even thought that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a 2006 study he conducted using his students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it that the information was only between them and their friends."
Subsequently, it is also to consider the question of methodology.
Even with off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to verify how much the information on the profile and the posts on the wall are true.
"What you're saying on Facebook and what you're doing outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook continue to remain the best possible tool to be used in the research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place offline."
"Folding and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to orchestrating two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "restrial" fighter during his first public court hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian Templar Knights," he said in a court where 500 people gathered.
"I raise an objection to the Court of Justice because you were given a mandate by organizations supporting the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I do not admit any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could proclaim his views."
For the same reason, Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech with him, refused to allow the relatives of his victims to reach out to the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banning him from any media contact for 4 weeks and announced that the final authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors took part in the hearing.
Some have come in hopes of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he is being held firmly under lock.
Everyone took part in order to move the case to close soon.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhumane," one of the survivors of the attack told the NRK commentator.
"It wasn't pleasant, but for myself I can say that after I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When arriving and leaving for the building, the view of the journalists and survivors in the eyes of the present.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion of being part of a larger "resistant" movement, the judge suggested that he was not insane, noting that there was no evidence that he had an accomplice.
It may be a comfort for some that attacks of 22. June seems to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically diminish the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she would fall out like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If so, everything would be much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie heading to cinemas this week
As soon as Steve Jobs 5. October he died, the opinions of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear - and elected him as his genius The Greatest Modern Inventor.
At Jobs’ recently rediscovered interview, which was dusted off for a special film heading to cinemas this week, Apple fans will be the fact that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who tunes every little detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the idea that a truly great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent final product, there is still a long way to go a bite of work."
In 1995, Bob Cringele was working on the TV show Triumph of Computer Fools, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. There was a unique, more than hour-long interview during the filming.
At that time, it was ten years since Jobs forced to leave Apple, and had his hands full with his new computer company, NeXT, and eagerly looked at how the general public would accept the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringele's entire interview was used on the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost while being transported.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: A Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is famous for his distaste for longer conversations, Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic to talk about his technological philosophy and trading strategies.
He also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the conversation, there is a longer pause between a question and an answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking about when you can see how Jobs thinks perfectly about the answer to be as apt and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when Cringely’s questions seems impatient and propelled him to get more important issues and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and there are frighteningly prophetic ideas when Jobs assesses what other companies are doing well and badly, offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It's one thing to read the posthumous assessments of Jobs' career, but on Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the flourishing of his genius, is something raw and inspirational.
He has his own vision of what things might and should look like.
It wasn't long before he said his ideas, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"During years of business, I always asked, 'Why do you do this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, never think about business-related things.
I found out.
Jobs goes on to describe his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused about the way the costs were recorded - they often started with the inscription "standard costs", their amount could only be imagined. At that moment, he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the business costs in a moment.
How he made a raspy to the pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and call anywhere in the world for free.
A lot has been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power, is literally contagious.
They tell how he and Wozniak tested the device using a paid phone and were transferred from one AT&T network to another during the call, while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a while we've knitted around the world like this, so when we shouted something into the paid phone, it came back a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
“We were young and found that we can build a thing that’s capable of managing billions of dollars’s infrastructure around the world.”
We made a tiny thing ourselves that could control a much larger giant - it was an incredible experience and, in my opinion, Apple would never have been created without it.
Jobs continues with a description of the prank, which Wozniak and Wozniak have almost brought to an end. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the pope, putting themselves as best as possible as possible as they did Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, the members of the Catholic Church were summoned to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and only just before they woke up the pope himself to the phone, the pair laughed and put the receiver.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and was looking for spare parts to build a frequency, he found a Bill Hewlett number in his phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“She has influenced me incredibly. It was the only company I met at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how it should treat its employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's research labs at Palo Alto, where he saw the "first desktop computer ever made."
He was like a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I was going higher and higher in HP, hanging around the computer and starting to write programs for him.
How he invents innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about how he invents new products on the fly.
In the early days of his career, when he set out to sell a few printed circuit boards, one customer asked him to put together a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days, during which he had to devise, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember how we were fighting pretty wildly... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [build a mouse that would cost $300] when I got tired of it, I came out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are breathing:
Long before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs predicted foresight that many industry leaders would falters in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copiers or printers, well, what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company could no longer be more successful.
At that moment, sales and marketing are already ruled, so companies are run by people who are in charge of this, while people in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius who led the company to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
This is exactly what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times bigger than it is, she could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
Instead of winning, however, they made a loss.
How it takes innovation as a form of art:
"A long journey and a lot of work is between an excellent idea and an excellent final product... and as the great idea develops, it also changes and grows."
During that time, you will learn a lot about him.
You have to accept a whole series of compromises - certain things simply do not force electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep in mind constantly 5 000 things - different concepts - and put them together...
Ultimately, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you try to translate them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I was never ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and coincidentally the best computer experts in the world.
Were it not for computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with opponents of the Health Care Act at the time when their case was dealt with by the court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether he would accept an objection to President Obama's Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, they attended a ceremonial dinner sponsored by a law firm to attend the court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges gathered to discuss the motions.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging radical overhaul of health care, which was passed by Congress last year - a bill that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit. However, a 5.5-hour meeting is expected in March, the outcome of which will be further stirred up by the presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer to stand before the court and will try to pass the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the United States attorney general under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies to help sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society group, which has been defending conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations questioning the law, the so-called. National Federation of Independent Entrepreneurship.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
It was attended by Mitch McConnell, the top representative of the Republicans in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And the guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: This pair of judges have been participating in the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's certainly not even about anything that's in violation of the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempted from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their behaviour would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge may participate in actions that are currently related and other organizations to hold for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorable guest, nor shall he be put on the agenda of the event."
Yet, however, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to the two law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest in this case, was richly enough to alert activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is inconsistent with the claims of several judges that the supreme court is behaving according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dined at the social benefit together with the legal representatives who are awaiting the hearing of their case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines the feet with all claims of non-biasedness, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy for their critics, and they told them that they were also seamlessly combining their judicial duties with the actions of groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Conservatives also argue that Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas have an ethical problem.
Kagan worked as attorney general under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
The critics of Kagan are pushing her to disclaim her involvement in the case, claiming that she was fighting so much for the law at the time to be unbiased now.
Kagan did not suggest that she was going to resign.
Boeing wins record $18 billion contract for jet planes
Emirates airline orders 50 two-cylinder Boeing 777 jet jets with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it is usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if the airline is an aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is a total of a record $18 billion, it is something else.
Equally important is the fact that Boeing won the contract from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 $450 billion worth of $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order in history over the weekend in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-cylinder Boeing 777 jets.
The sensational order came from Emirates-based airlines in Dubai.
Boeing told the 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines have the option to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, making the total order value climb to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes called Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
"This is an excellent news for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for the Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-mining nations.
This means that they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but the increase in the price of fuel - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - not so decisive, because the country itself makes money at higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as with other airlines that they could cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to an increase in fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The Emirates airline contract consolidates Boeaing’s leading position in a wide-hull-dose market and brings to the narrow company Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of their largest A350, which is a direct competitor of the 777-300ER, will be postponed.
The displacement occurred because customers demanded a greater utility load on the aircraft and the range, so the manufacturer took time to give the machine more power to the engine.
Boeing Co's actions priced up 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister appears to be defeated in the Michigan elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her adversary, Faust Vallejon of PRI, was helped in the pursuit of the governor's chair by drug traffickers.
Sister Felipe Calderon appears to have lost in the violent state elections for governorship in Michoacan. On Monday, she said that one of her opponents was helped by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results were put in the leadership in the governorship of the Western state of Faust Vallejo by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI.
“The intervention of organized crime members in the entire electoral process, and especially until yesterday’s election itself, is alarming not only for Michoacan, but for our entire country,” said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview with radio day after Sunday’s election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the opinion polling group... They confiscate the ballot boxes, built roadblocks... and let people vote to order for the PRI.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost the presidency.
But he plans an early return to power, and the victory in the election in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who was still leading the day before the election, very closely.
Calderon, the conservative party for her brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejone as the winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which until now controlled the governor's office. For the disgraced and misfortune pursued party, it is a very unfortunate loss before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also declined to recognise preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state's state name Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderon and it was in Michoacan in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against traffickers.
But the violence persisted.
The mayor of PAN, Luisa Marie Calderon's supporter, was assassinated just a week before the election, and many candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
However, no matter what the results of the election in Michoacan look like for the PRI party, the victory will help the party to get a new impulse.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington Vallejo, said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB Bank calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall decline in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of ADB-based ADB, said the two fastest-growing economies in the world must "do everything they can" to help the currency bloc's recovery quickly through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are watching all European difficulties "too unabated" and declared that Asian financial assistance combined with European leadership and funds will help to ignite the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So it's good for anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do that."
The European monetary association has been heavily tested by a serious debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have withdrawn.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns about the fact that it could drag the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge to bring together the newly booming front-familiar economies and help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but noted that mutual assistance - such as the purchase of the European Union's financial assistance bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility, would provide greater bargaining capabilities for Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, India's commerce minister, said "India will do what it can," to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and the drying up of foreign capital.
“Nobody wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
"We are faced with a difficult task and we must maintain a high rate of growth."
"It's not an alternative, this is a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as the Indian ones, have nothing to do with what to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid for Europe to 1.2 billion people of India when 800 million of them live from $2 or less per day.
"One day they could find out that the Greeks are retiring at fifty and enjoying the holidays on the beaches, which would probably be difficult for them to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, has similarly questioned why Indian stockpiles should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr. Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis is threatening a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank's forecast that there will be 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 is now facing a "risk of a decline" due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must create "unpredictable spending plans" to be protected from decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warnings about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta puts hard on the cable in Congress on Monday when he warned that emerging automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a $450 billion budget cut over the next ten years, but is now worried about a reduction of $600 billion if Congress fails to close a deal on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress' inability to reach a budget deal and the resulting so-called seal will cause a 23% flat-rate decline and halt to many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this imprudent way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you can not buy only three quarters of a building or a ship. Moreover, there could be serious damage to further modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"Also, we will be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is supposed to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians for forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the beliefs of those who care for our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, the cuts will also affect combat troops, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not directly affect this area, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"Telections will also be made in the contract staff, which will result in delays in arranging contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The stocks of paid employees will be reduced, resulting in delayed payments to suppliers and subsequent disruption of legal and political support."
Both senators wrote off Panette ten days ago and asked for details of the possible impact on automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the abuses at the Ministry of Defense could cause a rapid devastating view of the United States as the world's military superpower."
"We are strictly against this harsh action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they published Panett's letter.
"This is not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign up for it."
"Plant cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It will be seen whether Panetta's letter and fresh warnings will raise pressure on Congress approving the budget and amplified by voices calling to the Pentagon's missing from the list of cut areas.
Panetta has been increasingly open in talks on possible cuts, even though he himself switched to his senior position at the Pentagon with years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was embarking on a tough fight.
At a press conference held minute week, the defense minister hinted at a brief picture of what his department might expect - the army shell, which inside, however, will be missing the core.
"He'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like an ammunition brigade."
"It will be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the Pentagon's speech.
"She will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and incapable of coping with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome the aggression..."
In an appendix delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant reduction of the possibilities of landings and deployment around the world; the anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could await terminations, including those already tested, as well as those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the project of the F35, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal combat ship and a new ground combat vehicle that the army and the Marines wanted to replace the humvee.
By quelling further developments and testing the F35, $80 billion would have been saved over the next ten years, but its supporters say this is a necessary next step in improving the military, which needs the country to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A glance at recent newspaper headlines suggests how serious and ubiquitous lies and delusion in everyday life are.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusations that he sexually harassed several women - both sides say the other is lying.
The administrators at Penn State University were accused of perjury when they tried to hide the records that the retired football coach sexually assaulted the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught calling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie was able to destroy her entire career and shake the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he disclosed information that was immediately refuted by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of abusing his campaign funding to try to conceal his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that rang out around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Everywhere it's just swarming stories about cheating at school and at university.
There are cases when teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make them look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many scams do we encounter?
Studies show that in a single day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers had lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first meeting in their lives.
Determineing lies, or "ligering of lies," is an essential skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or professional reasons.
But it is not a social game that is similar, say, to the Sharia, when one shouts, "I have you". Deception recognition is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been dispelled.
The liars look into your eyes.
It's not like they're stumbling, stuttering, blushing, or fiddling.
However, do not deduce from the fact that it is somehow difficult to spot and expose the liar.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are made and their timing.
I have spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from the vast and emerging litter recognition industry, and it is clear that declaring deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can help you a lot in today’s complex world – especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them relax in vigilance, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men utter a more "superkin" lie, while women say more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they say are usually "uncontact").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called "the initial observation."
Thanks to it, he will have a later finding with what to compare.
Notice the posture of the subject, his laughter, working with the voice.
You should know if someone routinely is constantly tapping your feet so that you don't wrongly accede to them for lying just because the middle of the meeting starts tapping his foot.
Then try to determine the clumps of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But take this only as warning signs, not as evidence of a lie.
People uttering a lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when trying to remember their imagins story, they can turn the tips of the shoes to the door, lean toward the exit, significantly change the posture or show "relief after the end of the conversation" - an exaggerated relieved respite and change of position when there is a difficult confession behind them.
People interviewing often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like after it is finished.
Also feel the language of the subject.
Famous is a story about how Scott Peterson once misrepresented himself and used the past tense when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which has run a nationwide search for her body.
Deceptive individuals can also express themselves aloof: "I had no sexual relationship with the lady... Miss Lewinsky" or the difficult question will repeat the whole question.
The most common verbal signs are only very tiny.
Some may use a lot of "imeasening language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to my best of consciousness."
We will not learn too much in such an answer, and it is often another warning signal.

Controversial plan to build oil pipeline be rerouted after threat of delay in US government approval emerged
Days after Obama's government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thereby pitting unions against each other, but reassuring environmentalists - the pipeline-building company announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things would be set in motion again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would move the planned pipeline route from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the non-brain government.
TransCanada's group Alex Pourbax says the company is confident that eventually the construction of the pipeline will be approved, despite leading a different route.
The announcement came after a foreign ministry announced last week that it was postponing a decision on a federal permit to a project where it would not conduct studies of possible replacement routes that would be able not to interfere with the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the waterline layer of Ogalllal, a vast underground water reservoir.
"This is really moving forward," Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment ordered by the Foreign Ministry would probably postpone any decision until 2013, a year after next year's elections, but the authorities deny that politics would play a role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a State Department's request and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mild pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Alberta province to the Texas refineries, 700 000 barrels of oil flow through it every day.
This will have to be interspersed with 6 countries.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by work crews, which estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear while working on the pipeline.
However, the lawmakers in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the alumina of Ogalla, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing study on the environmental impact ordered by the Foreign Ministry found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said that the inspector general from the ministry had ordered a rehearsal of the entire process of the original study, and focused mainly on two issues.
It was once whether TransCanada, a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, posed a conflict of interest in the program.
Another, then, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of vomiting fears over her toddler
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle furiously burst into the lobby of their Manhattan house and frightened their daughter so much that she threw herself into fear.
The outtrothrone of the singer's hit "Lady Marmalade" scared eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "partisan changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit filed with Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk delivered the car, Roseanna Monk came down to their house in the Riverside Boulevard part, carrying Genevieve with it.
Rosenna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said yes, and I left to pick her up"
LaBelle rebuked the pregnant woman irritably.
"Aggrieved tone, she told me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,"" Roseanna Monk said.
"I said to her, "I don't care about your opinion.""
She became enraged and began to speak dirty - she shouted loudly the foulest expressions...
She had a bottle of water on her and she began to splash water from her.
He claims Genevieve had a hysterical attack.
"I said to the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," the mother of the child said.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her only after her entourage, who subsequently dragged her into a waiting car, was told by Roseanna Monk.
Meanwhile, the daughter roared so much that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter asking for an apology from LaBelle, but had no responses.
The lawyer and spokesperson for the singer LaBelle are not responding to our phone calls to comment on the entire case.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified compensation, but family attorney, Sam Davis, said he took charge of the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money to a charitable charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month-old child in his arms."
The adversity of climate has slowed the economy
During the first year of the reign of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and unreliability rose in Sinaloa, foreign investment and the economy with them decreased
2011 will be in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of Mario López Valdez's reign, which is called the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, but due to the unfavorable climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth and even the main indicators of economic development declined.
Low February temperatures caused millions in losses in agriculture, limiting the growth opportunities of the state economy, responsible for reducing economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the area of agriculture, there was a historic decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 780.0% were completely destroyed and partial damage was found to be 21.07%. The main destroyed crops include vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state recorded an increase in the first three quarters. From January to March, 55 053 of the population of the state of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, rising further, reaching 6.19%, representing around 74,000 unemployed. Compared to the first quarter, the number of unemployed increased by 18 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa is due to several factors. According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps taken at the level of public policy.
“We are witnessing an increasing unemployment that is related to various factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints as a result of legislation approved by the Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. It’s not easy for people who illegally seize dollars, it’s not easy for them to make money, invest them, or use them for something.”
Stopping migration
López Cervantes said the demographic factor is also contributing to the increase in unemployment.
“The number of people going abroad to work in the United States has decreased, both for reasons of difficult entry and also because even if these people get abroad, it’s hard for them to get a job. So people stay and demand work from our state, so unemployment is rising,” he said.
Unreliable
Analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the increasing unreliability that prevails in terms of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of employed residents in the state work without paying benefits to social security administration.
Unemployment and unreliability are added to other features of the labour market, such as low salaries. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries from all over the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labour and Social Planning Department.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa until September was 5 352 peseta, well below the national average, which is at 7 375 pesset.
Shortening of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, the most significant drop in foreign direct investment in 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Treasury Department, between January and June, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74% from $5,143,33 $317 per year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government lists investments of 17 280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly directed to services businesses.
Debt
In the context of the scenario of a downturn in the economy, the government of this state asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. This would be earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2 600 million peso. By November, no debt gains had been recorded, in any sector of the state economy.
Reaction
According to the representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés pointed to the lack of government management capabilities.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the government of the state itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really tiny this year. We need to work hard to get back the land we've lost this year. In 2012, we must redouble our efforts, lacking the harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the proper and synchronized functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better,” he said.
The Slowness of the Economy
Loredo López said events like frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and curtailed its development and growth.
"Weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore dynamism, which would allow for an acceptable level of movement for processes, products and services. That is why at the end of the year we found ourselves well below the expected forecasts," he said.
Redefinition of mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriart, president of the People's Republic of Mexico's Employer Confederation in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed towards more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we're observing that we're working. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has is mobilized," he said.
The work that is ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of a future that would better guide the government's efforts.
"Generally, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said the current administration has shown progress in terms of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that the work done here is visible and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana
Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fines for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for business purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CNN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican Army on 7. June 2010 during an errand in Cipriano Valdez, across the street 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer rode in a pick up carrier of white. In the car in the shelf he had a black bag and a small backpack in the passenger seat. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained available to the Judge of the Second Division, and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Impacts of Crime.
It owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, Saving public places and 3x1 for migrants, face the risk of not being brought to an end or that they will be delayed due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The director of urban social development said that if the construction work has gone forward so far, there is now a risk that the government of the state will not be able to secure the appropriate supplies that require funds of more than 11 million peso for three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs is nearly 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Until this time, only the Federation and the city have supplied the work, so it is possible that the implementation of the projects will be delayed.
"They're supposed to secure almost 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we've never gotten anything. Even though we were supposed to get part in July,” he said. “To make no’t waste time, we’ve started the projects and they’re going very well, but we’re missing money.”
He stated that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not meet the relevant deliveries, and therefore at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million, which was not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the aforementioned programs this year, we had to raise funds that would cover what the state did not finish," he explained.
Despite the promise by state officials to hand over these resources, he said a request to Armandu Villarreal, the secretary of administration and finance, was sent to hasten the proceedings and the corresponding percentages as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even got a peso yet."
The Court of Justice approves the 'end of analogous broadcast' in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogous digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidium Decree, which wants to hasten the so-called "exchange of analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He stated that there were no necessary eight votes to invalidate him.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mez, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree setting out the individual steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
An action filed by the Senate was dismissed with this result, because the qualified majority of the eight votes needed to allow the court could comment on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree in question, which remains valid.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues related to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). This violates the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exception of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight against the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it leading to the transition to digitisation.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies without entering a discussion on a proposal also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general norms of measures to prepare public administration.
“I don’t think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator,” and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to a federal executive who has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analogous digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in years. It is related to better use of the radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefit of digitalisation that requires decisions on public interest. Digitization has not only a technical dimension, but "also touches on economic, social, political and national security issues."
As he pointed out, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competencies that the Constitution puts into the hands of the government of the state.”
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, even though they had high-seccentric technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it is not possible for the government to introduce compliance with the laws prepared by law enforcement to some extent by issuing a dissenting decree in the area of congressional powers.
In Michoacan, they analyze the possibility of counting "voice-by-vote"
According to data published by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 out of 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "voice after the vote" appeared in this year's election in Michoacan, where in line with the data published by the Preliminary Election Results (PREP) program, the difference is between the first and second place in the governor's elections less than 27 percent, and it has not yet been counted on the votes of 879 out of a total of 6074 constituencies.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a number of measures that should harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoacán officially did not confirm his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the statutory period of entry was due to expire, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication within the deadline in the Act of the Official State Gazette, stating that he had any objections to them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the voice of the head of state on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because it does not have the right to "not even approve or veto them".
When asked by the possibility of counting "voice by voice" María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, by approving the relevant measures, it would be possible for the partial and overall counts to be carried out by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral parcels, may be made under the following conditions: the election results do not match; there is no entry of votes and the calculation in the relevant box or the President does not have it available; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the election results.
Moreover, the total recount of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request of a representative of the party and/or the coalition that proposed the candidate in second place at the beginning of the session appears.
The overall recount of the votes will also be possible when, after a proper account, it is established that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate finished in second place. In this case, electoral parcels will be discarded, for which a partial count was made.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been sumed.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. A ceremonial and memorial service will be held on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that its ashes be dispersed in the Zapaliname Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with other people who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital Coahuila on board a Mexican Air Force plane. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, Lieutenant Colonel's ashes arrived in the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell took place at the Technology Institute in Saltillo, organized by his former high school classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla, and his wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapaliname Mountains. That's what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieuker fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the peak of life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire flight school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always went after his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávalio remembers him as a very good man, "he barely came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him as he had brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapobran for the graduation of his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he liked best in his life: driving a plane.
They gave him the last goodbye
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he exceld in both the studio and the sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after the helicopter he was driving. There was also the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all officials of the state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Solznian native Bacio Cortés (surplified) arrived to be handed over to Mexican Air Forces through the funeral service under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez in the area where, meanwhile, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
Three abandoned bodies on Cadreyette NL farm found
Hours prior to the discovery, military officials introduced 11 people who had been detained in this area for crimes related to organized crime to the media.
The bodies of three men murdered by shooting into various parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned farmhouse of Cadreyeta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find occurred on 1.5 kilometers of the road from Cadreyteto to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who were moving in these places noticed that the hut with a beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of approximately three meters, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the relevant authorities.
One of the people was wearing a sporty T-shirt of yellow and dark cotton pants and not wearing a shoes. Next to him was also a man lying in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away, there was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
The three of them were lying face toward the ground.
According to data obtained in the site, all three persons were likely murdered elsewhere because bullets were not found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed by one group of organized crime of the other, as well as a series of bullets, both on the building and on the door.
11 Suspects Arrested in Cadreyt
The National Defense Secretary presented 11 people, including juveniles who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadreyt area and which is associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the published information on the first attempt on November 11 in the Los Alveros colony, 8 people were detained and one detainee managed to be freed.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they are members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another raid occurred on 12 November at 6 p.m. Military personnel were on a round in the Rancho Viejo area in Cadreeyta when he noticed a car without a license plate and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they carried out a search and discovered one rifle, a shell casing and 18 rounds of ammunition.
On 13 November, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was detained on 13 November at around 14:00. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadreyet.
New Italian government to be appointed on Wednesday
Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that holds the country over the abyss of economic catastrophe.
Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that holds the country over the abyss of the economic catastrophe and which has put the eurozone into danger.
The presidential palace issued a report in which it announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to introduce a government mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks he had with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The framework is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, i.e. in much shorter periods than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, due to which the amount of debt has climbed to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by the former European Commissioner, Monti, must approve the tough austerity package required by European leaders. This is the only way to restore the deremilined credibility of Italy.
There's a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry. Due to market instability, interest on Italian BTP bonds exceeded a 10-year maturity of a 7 percent threshold, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to apply for bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the Italian employer's Confindustrio organization, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this government is the last resort for Italy to get out of this burning situation.
Monti's hopes of success were significantly multiplied by Silvio Berlusconi's PDL support, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are destined for good results,” Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because up to this moment a number of its members have opposed a government with a technocratic majority, assembled by Monti.
Support for the Parliament
Monti's new government must have strong support for parliament in order to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Foreign Banks Association has added to the pressure, warning that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti opened on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organizations.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President Napolitan on Sunday, allowing very rapid progress in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond interest rates have returned to the critical threshold, responding to the uncertainty of whether the new prime minister would be successful.
Saving Italy, whose public debt is €1.8 trillion, would be beyond the possibilities of the eurozone’s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should stay in power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that say politicians will only give him time to carry out reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti said he would like to integrate politicians into his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to take Italy out of the difficulties the country has gone into because of financial pressure.
Political sources have said that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to integrate political figures into the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will exceed the limit of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 players called came to the number of 50 matches.
Huge contrast on Costa Rica side, if we compare the 22 players of the two countries, who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one month-long FIFA rating, have a wide range of A-class interleavers matches, Costa Rica only has defenseman Michael Uman, who is the only one to play 50 international matches.
He achieved this number last Friday during a match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández stadium.
The Spanish footballers, who play in the Stars Match and the powerful English Premier League clubs, have maintained intense activity in league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches in the European Cups as Champions League for over a year.
We also have to add to the previous experience from the national Spanish team during complicated knockout matches for the European and world championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concaff, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has scored goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (losing 0-1 in London) has reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas will still play against Costa Rica today and will get a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a key Barcelona player, has 106 games to score.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially declared UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have hundreds of games to their credit. Among them, Zubizarreta with 126 and central striker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol came close to a hundred with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and near Michael Uman, the left wing Júnior Díaz moves with 48 games and goaltender Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Next only 5 surpassed the 30-game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet has included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"A journey to Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true for them.
This is what the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The band is located on the South American continent as part of a tour on the occasion of celebrating the 20th anniversary of its existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
On the day, he will perform at the National Stadium from 19:30 along with the angel group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from an interview whose entire transcript can be found on the website La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, this is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes reality.
We are hardly the second time in South and Central America, and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It's a beautiful country and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally adore the group here, fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you think of your most rocky supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry that it took us so long.
Some people talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it cause more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've put in the last 21 years have emerged in a matter of weeks.
We have put in some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we got in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and her waves that are suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no restrictions on what we can't do.
We will try to perform the best possible show with various songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce a good and diverse repertoire to our fans.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think that partly it is because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose what songs we play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven’t played for a long time, we focus on them and we’re also surprised, because we’ll think about why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of artistic career.
When you look back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don’t think any of us could have imagined that we would be in a big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years. That sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and are moved to be able to continue to play together.
We love each other and love to create music.
We are lucky to be able to look at the places we have always wanted.
We couldn't have turned out better.
What did it mean to you that you were a significant part of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group in which the greats are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends, it doesn’t happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups come from one city at once.
We are proud of this and we are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky to be our friends all and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think first of all we are lucky to be in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other play a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have managed to open the musical paths that leave everyone sufficient freedom to experiment.
We believe in each other, we appreciate the music of the other and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship with the word glory was not easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew, it was gradually becoming easier to find a balance.
We try not to go too much on tour, because it is very easy to fall into this trap of the crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for the sake of music, you will remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You mustn't get carried away by being famous, rock stars. Neither of us ever really cared about this.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and in the beginning it was something spectacular.
We've been a band for three years and we've never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember Andy how incredible he was, how I laughed at him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person and we miss him very much.
The national band Las Robertas will be tasked with starting a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as their opening act?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several suggestions and we liked this group the most. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas will offer live and have to be very fun.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's adding the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influences you as a bassist?
Lots of people.
I'm the first to think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk about bassists I like all night.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge, even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we've all always felt slightly apart from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine the groups I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time. And if even today music is valid, it's something great, because it's music worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly crumpled character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting because I feel that there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very bleak, although they can sound positive.
For both of them, when Ed played them, I cried, and they are songs deeply dark.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent just that for me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for the muscle loss he suffers from the lower extremities, his attending physician reported.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a sentence of 25 years imprisonment for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, for which he has been operated four times and is already under control by doctors.
Member of Parliament Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television station that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of No Plastic Diseases within three days, where they should find out why it hurts and why it loses strength in the lower extremities.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion, Fujimori could receive clemency for humanitarian reasons, however, the former president himself does not want a pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times due to tongue cancer, he dropped 18 kilograms, and these problems were joined by other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst on the pancreas, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor enumerated.
Fujimari has been serving a sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people killed by murder squads of troops operating illegally in his first years of his reign.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a large-scale visit to meetings with representatives of politics, commerce and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
A meeting between the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political affairs between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office posted on its website.
According to local media, Mujico will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that will continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community. The statement prompted a rejection of Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador in that European country.
Mexico has been presided over the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the most powerful and developed countries in the world. Since January this year, an agreement has been reached with the Latin American country to exchange information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been seeking to specify fiscal exchange agreements to access the "blacklist" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of tax cooperation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded the FTA Agreement since 2004, thanks to which the exchange of goods between the two countries has been strengthened.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been struggling tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, was formed from the beginning to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said a press official on Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a presentation of a video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because up to this moment successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to the fact that the image is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can embark on a "second round" on the levels of the game, which are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose the real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome all sorts of challenges and "not to succumb to optical deceptions".
This new launch of Super Maria in 3D also anticipates the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays into the note to those who watch the saga and repeat the successful formula from the previous episodes. It consists in the fact that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, in the surroundings, in disguises and also among the enemies, there will also be a "playful" Luigi.
Colom approves Portillo extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has taken steps to issue the release of former President Alfons Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the trial of which was aimed at allowing Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country, which is demanding the extradition of Portillo, to judge him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judicial and executive power and that he bears in mind that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he "did not interfere" with the court decisions and allowed all extraditions that came to his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both of them for drug trafficking.
Colom's move marks a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to conduct a trial against the former president who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are respected.
Portillo was found not to be innocent of embezzling 120 million at the Department of Defense at the time of its presidency. This trial was preceded by extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and returned the case to the game.
Triniyev helped 6000 young people in a state of emergency
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they do not find themselves on the margins of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of the social support organization Triniyov is very important: 6,000 young people who were at risk of social exclusion have received help. For 25 years, the organization has helped them overcome difficult situations.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary was also used to present the balance sheet as part of a ceremonial act that took place in the former production premises of the Fabra i Coats factory, attended by more than 300 people.
Triniyove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, jobless, drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andrea was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association in the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unified character of the work carried out by Triniyev.
Along with President Generalitat, Arterus Maso, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by a former Socialist Counselor for Education, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current environmentalist Councillor Ricard Goma.
The current Social Well-being and Family Coassists adviser, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also came to the great hall of Fabra and Coats.
Mas said that Triniyev originated in a very difficult time and that today’s times also provide a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day “is a good foundation.”
The president cited Triniyev as an example of how it is possible to fight adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“Crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does,” he said.
There was an eviction of the occupied house, in which gigantic parties were held
Aliens have appropriated 11 of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon, without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by neighbors from the number 51 in Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people volunteered yesterday at noon to the building they were inhabited illegally and where they organized gigantic parties that woke up neighbors. They left the building by order of the court and without having to intervene the police.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"Since now, the entrance will be guarded," the administrator said.
The occupiers, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partially water equipment, in addition, they painted the walls and left behind the garbage all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, huge parties were held, which lasted up to two days and woke up to other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that as long as the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupiers of the building made her unfair competition, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while at the discotheque it costs 10.
In addition, the entertainment business owner had to respond to neighbors' lawsuits due to noise. However, the problems were caused by the visitors of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially those who participated in the parties held here, the frequency and intensity of which have increased in recent weeks, according to the agitated inhabitants of the surrounding area.
The owner of the discotheque explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building and had been waiving her rent for nine months.
City police also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors over the past few weeks about the situation.
The chairman of the city group of the People's Party of the PP at the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be immediately evicted and thus put an end to the problems of civil coexistence that the neighbors suffer from, and the destruction of the area."
The chairman of the People's Party explained that only one floor was occupied before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers have reached all floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there were even thefts.
In this regard, he added that "there is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent in terms of acts against civil responsibility that occurred in the building."
Yesterday, city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 o'cate 30 minutes, police got into building 35 on Mont-ral Street after it was summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
Architects gathered on the occasion of the proceedings, which entails more than a controversy regarding fees
The 16-gate town selection process once again opens up a debate about the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid 80's, at the time of the greatest heyday of the already defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After the CMB ceased to exist in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the upper frontier of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that is not oriented on the north-south axis, but up (mountains) - down (sea).
Collserola qualifying as a natural park is going in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of the Yogi bear.
Such was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions on the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, plays rather the idea of the park.
Either this, or someone is trying to place the gate in the field.
So there is only one question: Collserola, a park or a mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational and on the basis of reflection on the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already as bitter theme as when two members of this old caste of the chosen ones shake hands when meeting in an elevator.
And it was this feat that provoked one of the rare matches between three Barcelona architects and the pre-ached university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection process has its justification.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Bay party began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain party", so the speech of Ildefons Cerd about the green apples was not finished.
"We have to follow the principle that the largest Barcelona park is the beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gateway to Collserola" carries "lexilogical trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a delimitation of zones where it is possible to act".
The idol, like Roldán and Bayona, with the experience of the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" offering "one of the dangers."
The danger resulting from "uncertainty, which today represents the project of a public place" after the experience of the 80's, which had "her swan singing" in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very demarcatement of the boundaries where it should be built.
“To define something is to take the next step,” that is, in principle, move one step further.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus in more detail on the question, Mododol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "deemed as a park", but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographic reasons.
Mododol also recalled that there was already a work carried out by Patronat de Collserola, which "cannot end up in the rubbuff," even though he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his gremia to intervene in the project from "first time".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but he "doubles" that this should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill," he adds), which needs to be created: "Architects should only be tools."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the title to this game is complex, because in the basis for the selection process lacks a global vision Collserola: "16 tenders have been announced that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study to look at the area and understand it as a whole."
This makes it possible that at least he has applied for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project of one gate can allude to the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his view, the town hall should guarantee that the zone located immediately above Ronda de Dalt should secure a zone of equipment in its entire length, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino pardons Jonas Larrazabal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal envoy Cadino Red granted pardon to the mayor's mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the lawmaker Casino Red granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court in a given precinct hearing a case of extortion in which the mayor's brother of Monterrey was indicted.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, posted a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás was to ask him to pay an economic quota to allow the Monterrey City Hall to allow an illegal operation in a betting house.
After the public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal prosecution of the boss of the panisticai mayor. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry No. 3 Agent for Property Crimes, he was taken to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital of the state.
He remained at this place for the next 49 days after a second incarceration was handed down and an agent of the Public Ministry refuted the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On 19. He was taken to a Cadereyta criminal court in October on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with an amount of one and a half million peso. However, he remained in a prison with moderate supervision for only a few hours as he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
25. On October, he was handed an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence to prove Jonás' guilt had been gathered. The evidence includes, for example, the payment of the amount of 1.5 million peso to the representatives of the casino in exchange for the promise that the operation will be allowed.
This Monday, the lawful envoy of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecino and asked for a pardon for the brother of the region's mayor. Based on this, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the lawful hearing, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to that court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damages had been corrected and which of the associates decided to grant pardons. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain classified.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, the legal grace of Jonas Larrazábal is granted. In the process that was conducted against him, it will not be possible to file any complaint. It is also not possible to claim compensation for damages or punishment.
After a trial with a legal commissioner at around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazaball Breton.
The court's secretary, Jorge Yanez, came to the prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to announce to Jonás that he had been granted an official pardon and his case was put into an archive.
He also announced that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of an air accident in which the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others, were killed.
The Secretariat for Communications and Traffic (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident, in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora was killed and seven others showed that the helicopter hit the terrain with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, said the pilot said before taking off the plane, the pilot stated that the climatic conditions allow for the flight.
"The parts that appear suggest that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings were entangled in the branches of the trees 25 meters from where the unit lost the hull."
He also reported that the unit was intended for 19 people, therefore it met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he said that based on an investigation carried out in the area of impact, no parts were found on the ground.
"The search was found that parts of the aircraft were not located in another place, so the plane hit the mainland as whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, met all requirements for the transport of persons.
The terrain shows a slope with an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation can take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, CEO of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the moment of the crash, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at a cruise rate and the accident occurred on a soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a common flyby operation," he said.
At the press conference, the representative of the SCT Pérez Jácome listed six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in AICM state adequate conditions at take-off, in line with the aircraft advances towards the border, between DF and the State Mexico there were visible layers of clouds at low heights.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility up to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinators of the impact and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajectory before the impact.
Dispersal of aircraft residues in limited territory:
The information we currently have available allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a flat trajectory and from the side.
A sketch of the scattering of the remnants of the aircraft suggests that at the time of the impact on the mainland, the helicopter was complete.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident that evidenced that there had been an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that several contacts may have occurred with the mainland.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above the sea, the terrain is sloping, the height of the inclination goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show footage in which there was likely to be a breakdown along the route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search around the accident, in an area that is more extensive than the territory of the demarcation, the remains of a helicopter were not found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in a state where the helicopter was still complete.
Mexico's Health Insurance Institute launches gene research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for the obesity of children and adolescents. Research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to uncover a gene causing obesity in children and young people. The research, called "The Genetics of Obesity in Children and Teenagers," will allow you to obtain results regarding overweight.
In a report by the head of the Research Medical Unit in the field of biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and pupils of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestava) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, who has or has no right to participate in the research, can also participate in the research. People can come to participating IMSS sports centers in Valle de Mexico, where each sibor will be carried out from 8 a.m. to the youth tests.
He stressed that the research began at the Sports Centre Cuahutémoc (Mexican state) and from 8. On October, this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualcóolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
Once data is obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors on Mexican children and young people and thus prevent the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday, all participants are given anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose levels, trigliceride, cholesterol, insulin and genes are examined (trying to identify genes that are involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said the research reflects health workers' concerns over an alarming increase in baby weight.
'Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys had a 77% increase in obesity and 47% for girls. There was also a dramatic increase in the case of overweight', an expert from IMSS said.
He stated that one of the reasons for finding indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic makeup, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in genes that are responsible for the emergence of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as an inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, which will determine whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of wrinkles of dark color (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-sugar conditions.
The information is still confidential, doctors pass it on to parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make in order for their children to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle meaning a lack of daily physical activity, all-day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Overweight is also caused by a large caloric intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins, and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no potholes in the Asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry, UNAM creates modified asphalt with polymers, creating a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If the paving were properly cared for, it would not have to be repaired almost 200 thousand potholes after each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de Mexico, said Rafael Herrera Nájer, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemical Technology (FQ) from UNAM, who at the same time added that if the design and maintenance of asphalt paving were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or even could be removed completely.
In his lecture, the Technological cause of potholes he uttered within the International Year of Chemistry announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalt with polymers, which should create a mixture with similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example, in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with high molecular weight, which are called asphaltene, and others with low molecular weight, which are called mortars. Together, they give the asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic character of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees has a high viscosity, and at 50 degrees it is almost in solid state, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, the chemical engineering expert pointed out.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in the Ciudad de Mexicoco were covered with flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the uppermost layers there is an asphalt insert, consisting of small stones embedded in asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms a liner is covered with asphalt.
When passing cars or when creating pressure, it is possible for the forces in the pavement to spread well.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would have decomposed even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the last layer called a cloak, consisting of fine stones, i.e. sand also embedded in asphalt, is placed on the asphalt liner.
Since this layer will come into contact with the vehicle rims, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the roadway.
Since it will be subjected to a large load as part of the paving, the mantle must have a sufficient thickness and be careful of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. Water, in particular, has a big impact on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is moist, the water spreads inwards and is hard to get out, this causes softening of all layers of the pavement and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that during the formation of potholes, the film of the cloak is the first to be damaged, and only then the asphalt insert is damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one point, but it is a gradual process that should stop at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load on vehicles is another important factor in the formation of potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of paving must correspond to the load of vehicles and it must be guaranteed that this burden will not be exceeded. This is the only way to prevent the frequent formation of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that when it comes to asphalt, we still have a lot of work to do, and the research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow you to easily repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle's candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analyses of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna not winning the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first moremission.
Valle del Cauca again did not reach the Miss Colombia crown.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for her to find herself on the podium of the winners, she gained a silver crown and a sash, on the basis of which she became the new first vice-miss of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which it won and the sceptre took over Miss Atlantico, the aforementioned department won the 14th title of the first multiple. Melina thus joined the crowds of women from Valle del Cauca, who were within reach of the winning crown, but were eventually declared the first multiplemission. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993),Youth Alyure (2008).
The question many are asking for. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the great favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has the power to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain she became the Queen of the Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently won the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only the First Vice-Miss is the fact that it did not convince its answer to the question: "What book did you like the most and why?", given by Martín Murillo Gómez from the literary editorial office of Leamos.
When asked, the candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I strongly believe in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culture. The book that most influenced me in my childhood was "The Little Prince," a very deep book.
I am currently reading "A Crime and Punishment." It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have a book with me by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It is a beautiful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
She did not like this answer on the one hand because of the term "culturalize" and secondly, because the candidate did not explain how the individual books mentioned.
At the end of the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen, it will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The Little Prince is a beautiful book.”
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
The Bogota journalist indicated that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, most celebrated and the one who took away all the previous prizes (The Astronomical Challenge of Oster, the title of the public for the best art dress and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other contenders, stressed the queen, who then failed on the scene.
This was evident in the first presentation of the swimsuit on Hilton Beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Although she was glowing on both of them, it was clear that she lacked strength and ferzziness, which was demonstrated by the representatives of Magdalene and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Like Home" program at the Canal RCN, believes that Melinda won the title of the first multiplemiss confirms the fact that the candidate who gets the most titles during the competition ultimately does not leave with the Queen's crown."
Moreover, in recent days, Valle has held a rather unkind attitude towards the media and it did not pay off for it.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
Only marginally, two days before the election, an international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the Miss Colombia competition beauty alone is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. We need to focus on social sensibilities. It is important that candidates before they enter the competition are involved in such projects," she explained.
There is also speculation that the candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and the fibrosis that was evident on the buttocks. But this is completely at odds with the jury’s verdict, which chose her the miss “natural beauty” for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the Queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with fibrosis on the butt, which, in my opinion, was not very noticeable, took away her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that a native of Valle made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they didn't make it in Valle.
The body was never her strength, and here she took its toll."
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Assembly, after the parade in the swimsuit, there was a cruel prediction, which was fulfilled. It was argued that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo allowed Melina so he wouldn't have to give her the highest crown in the end.
Whether it's true or not, it's certain that Melina started the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, he will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the thrilling success in Cartagena, did not make it to the highest crown.
Such was the work of the resident of Cali, who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali fingerprint expert went down in history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4 last year, an CTI fingerprint expert at Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader Farc: "Alfonse Canoe" by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department, Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejad, who has been working in a field of judicial research for 21 years, was a member of the CTI.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to work his way through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where there were corpses that had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital, Valle, and after taking the appropriate courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of rubbing the skin, i.e. the palm of the hands and feet.
In the week when the operation was carried out against the aforementioned Alfons Can, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmir.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he was suspected to be one of them the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, they asked him to take a card with Guillermo León Sáenz (his true name).
However, when he and the investigating team arrived at the place where the corpse was located, he did not recognize it because of the physical appearance. He looked very different than in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a villager in a given area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with the galton magnifying glass, ink and transplanter and light, Eliazar began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse with card notions.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
On the same night, a man originally from Puerto Tejad was commissioned to confirm to the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether it was indeed the Chief Commander of Farc.
Searching for stops
For the dactyloskop from the Sijin de Cali, the recognition shown to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the operational service against "Cana" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help to investigate crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they catch them, a lot of delinquents present fake papers or don't have papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator recounted that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because in this place the thief was leaning on to pull out a vault full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to collect fingerprints, but in this case we could get an entire handprint and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions in the event of murder.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around them.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the imprint on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be confirmed that he was really a murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint specialist explained that objects "share them using chemical or physical reactive substances."
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used for their collection.
After that, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or on Registrature.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data is nowhere to be entered,” said an expert at CTI.
He explained that not everything is as it turns out in the CSI television program.
Like everything that sparkles, there is no gold, not everything you touch, there are traces.
However, if it can be used, the appropriate comparison must be made.
'The Indignation' protests in New York City
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the space and moved to the nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday as they tried to re-enter Manhattan, where they were escorted out in the morning. Then they tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order that allows the "indignant" to return to camping in place. The second part of the movement responded to the eviction by taking up a park in the north of the city, where there was further detention.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle elsewhere and continue the lawful battle with the aim of returning to Zuccotti, both through assembly and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the "Found Wall Street" movement.
Bray clad that the response of the "indignant" eviction of the camp ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself made it to the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forcible eviction of the site and allowing the demonstrators to continue to camp here.
In addition, "indulgent" were occupied by another park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the parish in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take up the place, but then the police came and appreshed some demonstrators. Bray didn't know the exact number, but said he saw that they had put on some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site. A delegation of religious leaders also came to express their support and also to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected, which should take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the relocated demonstrators even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave them to members who were guarding the square, prompting "some small clashes," said Bray, condemning the fact that some officers beat the demonstrators.
A court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or using "laws that have been published after the occupation began, or ban the demonstrators from accessing the park with shops or other places they had previously exploited."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this injunction, the city suspended the opening of public space again and warned the demonstrators that local laws do not allow them to return with tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were seized and which was approached because the demonstrators "violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it became "a place where people did not go to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases hurt others" because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors feared for their quality of life."
“The morning eviction was appalling and shows Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the American working people,” a spokesman for the movement said.
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also said they plan to organize "big action" for Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to commemorate two months after which protests last. They started on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will introduce the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "Home Improvement," a parachute in "Baywatch," a bunk in "Playboy," the wife of the year-long musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private broadcaster CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a TV program in which Anderson, also known from online domestic pornographic images, appears with her ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll in the crashes representing Santa.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent, who recently served as a presenter on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena will appear on the scene.
Krome Anderson and Peterse will feature Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bubble called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York "Foot."
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending with a period of falls that began in March
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has escalated into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country has had to face since World War 2.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have quantified material losses at $300 000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global situation, is healing well.
After three quarters of the fall, the value of GDP rose between July and September to such a position that it was possible to reverse the page with definitive validity: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - for Japanese people the tax year begins in March 2012 - they also anticipate the highest growth rate compared to the period January-March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses have increased their investments by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% from January to March. This is the first decline in six months of continuous growth.
However, the true awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse that forces us to take advantage of the crisis to come out of it, or to restore infrastructure. It is about using the shortage to start completely from scratch.
Japan has awakened. Mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in vehicle spending, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yenu
Flows were brought into the hands of the internal market when the European - Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but at the same time a great burden on export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large tech groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to September just the yen exchange rate.
While markets continue to be besieged by peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is vigilant.
“We need to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
And truly, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stated that most member countries showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
An indicator that predicts inflexibility in the world economy has shown that the economy of the main powers is slowing.
It dropped by four-tenths to 100.4 points versus 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even come below the average, which is at 100. It reached 99.13 points.
Athens spreads uncertainty again
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the swift and risky fringe guarantees and the uncertainty that has reigned again, Greece is increasingly entangled in a labyrinth that leads to the exit of the major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "compliment" of the new transitional Greek government is given by the demands of Brussels rather than by the true convictions of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received on his appointment is likely to be short for their application, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new austerity measures would in no way be supported and reiterated his demand for new elections to the expected date of 19. February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decisions of the summit of 26. October," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
The package with 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the Samaras message does not clarify any doubts about his position: "We have committed to helping a transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The Conservatives leader went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are supposed to unblock the $8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, however, he said he would not support and sign any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, already influencing the impact caused by Papandre's referendum games, stressed yesterday that its demands are insurmountable: it will not unblock any assistance if the new government and the leaders of the main parties do not sign a "writing commitment without doubles and as soon as possible."
An Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors from the Troika will return "very soon" to Athens and negotiate with the new government about "what it needs to pay the sixth part" of 8 billion. There is no definitive date.
The Greek spindle has so much to get out of.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity. It is a tool based on trust in man.”
The Queen yesterday launched the 5th Global Summit of Microloans in Valladolid, with the belief that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operations "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. “In particular, it is the achievement of targets to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, with the amount that sets the poverty threshold.”
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly," stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiative and contribution of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" to whom these loans are primarily intended.
"We have already achieved much" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The microloan summit is intended to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support "basic goals."
Her Majesty explained that the aim is to have 175 million poor families access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and to bring 100 million families above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and other countries of the world after "as the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus, went on this journey," the Queen said, adding that it was an act of justice and the necessary recognition.
She described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist who set out on the path of combating poverty." She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet his loan policy on the spot.
This experience was followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and the next meeting in Côte d'Ivalence in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to state constant developments, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned yesterday the title "head of the family" awarded her in Valladolid by the "money movement of the poor".
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by urgering the participants to engage in discussions and finding solutions, thereby allowing them to continue to fight poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must follow.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the period of the globabytage, because this cooperation is a "permanent duty".
Jiménez believes that microloans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty", and now, more than ever before, governments of developed countries have to work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microloans is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to the people to whom everyone else closes the door. The mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the participants in the city, which "opens his gates to the spirit of solidarity, which is contagious."
CDU proposes to elect a European president on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious difficulties for the Chancellor and chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it did not happen until the autumn, especially to satisfy the party members who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow against the Italians to be lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission, submitted by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
The few minutes of standing up at the conclusion of Angela Merkel's speech, and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, did not leave room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarized in the slogan: the response to the crisis "there is no less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
According to the chancellor, in Europe "the time of change has come."
This could be expressed by changes in the Lisbon Treaty allowing European Union control over budgetary policies of the eurozone member states, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage "in order to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, the inspiration of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the UK is opposed, and the CDU leaders think Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position.
But the direction is set.
Likewise, delegates rejected a large majority of the proposal to evaluate the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in strengthening Germany's weight.
Led by the concern to calm the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not try to win a congress with talk about "small" European states or states that are in trouble willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe is devoted to one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle with Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in case of incapacity for work?
After the aid, the UMP party and the government are launching an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Authority, where he will give a speech on the topic recurring since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigor, but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, due to budget savings, the government intends to impose on private sector employees the fourth day of incapacity for work before they start taking support in sickness.
Clearly speaking, without the consent of the company, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic reach: to give civil servants one day unpaid incapacity for work (when they have no incapacity for three days in the private sector so far).
While these issues are under discussion, the right-wing majority also launches the topic of fraud aimed this time at mischiwinds tied to incapacity for work.
“The inspections will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you are caught, you will return,” Xavier Bertrand said during an interview provided to RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear somewhat disproportionate to the truth of incapacity for work.
In fact, these have been the subject of permanent surveillance since 2002 and the political onslaught that bore fruit.
The French are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let’s stop by a few official numbers.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM - state health insurance company), more than 237 million euros of daily refunds were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Care, daily refunds with their 11.3 billion euros accounted 5% of health expenditure in health care in 2008.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity allowances and accidents at work and 54% concerned incapacity for work, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
Only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to an Alma Consulting study, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The diameter that hides certain deviations: another poll published in r. 2007 on the website dealing with the job opportunities Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 respondents told that they had not chosen any day of incapacity for work.
Another study, this time conducted by sickness insurance institutions, clarifies that in r. 2010 37.8% of incapacity for work was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% lasted longer.
When compared to their European neighbours, French employees are no more susceptible to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS (National Research Centre) researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (from health reasons or not) oscillated between 10% and 11,8% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating on incapacity for work is only a very small part compared to black work.
When it comes to fraud, these are only small scales.
Strengthening legislation from r. 2002 has caused systematic controls aimed at incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that at 1.5 million inspections, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incapacity for "unjustified or too long," i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity for more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorised" were counted per 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
Thus, a total of 169 000 "unjustified" cases for several million employees who had incapacity for work.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tiano, author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the collection of taxes per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply new bailout plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to rebuild its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos made these words before parliament, adding that a hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to fulfill this task.
“To bring our economy back on our economy again, we need the support of our European partners and a new bailout budget plan,” he said, declaring his first public speech on Wednesday at the start of a debate on a vote of confidence in parliament.
Application of decisions adopted 27. October at the eurozone summit, the "main task" of the new government will be, as our country's participation in the eurozone is in play, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "in the vicinity of 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year after it was 10.6% in r. 2010 and 15.7% in r. 2009.
Righty rejects new austerity measures
Right-Term Leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support on Monday with an already approved measure to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party was not commiting any additional austerity measures.
“We will not raise our hand for any new measures,” Samaras stressed at a meeting with MPs for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed to the targets for reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would impede economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economics and the Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties that will support the measures envisaged, Antonis Samaras replied that his word is enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide need to be legalized, says expert committee
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are denied death.
In the matter of pallaitative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best paliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives the idea of denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and take decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report of the Royal Canadian Society, in which six experts working in various areas were involved, including ethics, law and medicine.
This Commission recommends the government to change the criminal law in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, if this election appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
Initially, experts cite a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medication yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to pallaitive care, experts tell us with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the wish to die at home, most Canadians, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in Quebec province this figure is the highest with 86% of those who died in hospital.
As for the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about the criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also taken control of all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this de-crime causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or dissenting.
On the contrary, p. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more in the teleconference yesterday than numerous cases of these fumes in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that according to an investigation conducted by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia, believing that it will allow those at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending out the message that the life of old or handicapped people is less valuable.
As regards persons practicing assisted suicide, 41% of the persons surveyed believe that they should not be prosecuted in court.
In the matter of maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also suggest in the list of their recommendations that criminal law should state that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires professional doctors to be educated to be encouraged to respect refusals of treatment at the end of life without being afraid of prosecution.
In the matter of pallaitative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best paliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final easing already widely used in Canadian health establishments, the Commission calls for it to be considered euthanasia at a time when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the report by experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of experts-signatories of the report as "extreme" among others because he does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who would be more than 18 years old could ask to help commit suicide,” says Pierre Deschamps, who studied mute news yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that this looks as if the authors of the report are building the autonomy of a person above all the other values that shape the social fabric of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a "manifesto for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts particularly the data of the report on the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e., in the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus talks about "complete"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad were demonstrating outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria were influenced by President Bashar al-Assad, who with the support of Russia resists them and speaks of the "complete" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the countries bordering Syria, took a stand in favor of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first ruler of an Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed."
“If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,” said the king of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, an interview with the BBC.
For his party, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that efforts to Turkish mediation on the Syrian regime had not been crowned with success since the beginning of the year.
“Th who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to neighboring Syria, to which Turkey is applying an increasingly tough line.
The United States rejoiced at the "strengthening consensus against Assad and the dishonest behavior of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries as Turkey are applying an increasingly harsh tone" against repression in Syria, commented Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
During this time, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces were killed in the city of Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this NGO, two other civilians "whole firefights and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
After all, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had "godged on a journey out of the crisis."
After all, he also reacted vividly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus’ membership, which he said represents a “dangerous step”.
Syria "will not bow," he assured that "the "completes usered against Syria will not succeed."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently thinking about the "mechanism of the protection of civilians" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favorable to the idea of sending U.N. observers to help protect civilians from repression of the regime, which he believes is "paranoid."
The new special meeting of the League is called to Rabat on tomorrow to take its position on the plan to resolve the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and in which the withdrawal of armies from the cities plagued by the dispute and the liberation of imprisoned manifestors was particularly envisaged.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday considered the decision of the Arab League to be "faulty," while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but at the same time completely avoided supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifices from Italians
Italy's next head, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start applying a program that will include "sacrifice" to regain credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner discussed political parties yesterday before he met with representatives of trade unionists and employers today.
He should assemble a relatively slim cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke about an important program with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the proposed prime minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, expects Mario Monti to ask parliament to vote in confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti's performance by a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented on the nervousness in the financial markets yesterday and asked them for time.
In the "democracy, the exact deadlines" apply in terms of the preparation of the government and its program, he stressed, adding that he was "assucher that the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president was initially favorably accepted by markets, but concern reappeared after the unexpected September slump in industrial production in the eurozone.
The appointed Prime Minister should put together a team involving primarily technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept "politics" into it.
He expressed his belief that the new government will last until 2013, i.e. by the date of the next election.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the confidence of parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of making Italy "renew a strong article" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its goal, which is a balanced budget in r. 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
Confindustri Agency chief Emma Marcegagli, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to reinvigorate the economy" because a country that does not show growth cannot adhere to deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence," the professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorials, the "news" and "other Italy", represents an "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The life of his team will be a great unknown.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections as Italy must place government bonds worth 200 billion euros by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helps Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator usable for an atomic weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risks reported on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the United Nations Agency.
Last week, the IAEA disclosed its "serious concern" as to the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, widely drawn from IAEA by V documents. Danilenko (b. 1934) was to work for three decades from the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In r. 1989 or 1991 was to leave the center to establish a "nadiamond-diamond" company in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society were meant to bring him to contact in r. 1995 Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia, he was supposed to cooperate from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian program.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was "based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one member state informed the agency - worked during a substantial part of his working career on this technology under the military nuclear program of the country where it comes from."
Anti-Muslim criminal offences and offences rise by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of criminal acts and offenses targeting against Muslims has risen since r. 2009 to r. 2010 by almost 50%, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or increased slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in the year. 2009 at 160 in the year. 2010, i.e. A 49% increase over the 13% advancement for anti-candidate violence, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews and an overall increase of 14% for anti-religious criminal offences and offences.
The total number of "hate criminal acts"" has risen very slightly to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% were, according to the FBI, motivated by racial differences and 20% religious differences.
"After the decline in r. 2009 is disturbing to see these criminal acts and offences rise again,” said Human Rights First, “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,” the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hateful criminal acts, must be seen as a serious violation of human rights,” adds Paul Legendre, one of the leaders of the organization’s official.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these abuses,” he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports of “hate criminal acts.”
A "hatred criminal act" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This rule of law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more Facebook is
The website providing microblogging services Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of successors, somewhat likeishing its services to Facebook.
New "activity" and "name" allow you to better and directly know the activities of other persons who are watching you or those whose answers ("tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know if they allow you to follow posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested in August on a small percentage of users" before it was spread across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followrifiday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisteur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre aini a un public plus large avec un maniment plus and celui des réseaux grand public Facebook.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differ the importance of this innovation.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too similar to Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function will better help me track some elements of my Twitter," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
Enrollment of the Golden Rule on a Balanced Budget in the Constitution
The government of the grand coalition of the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to register the "gold rule" of budgetary policy in the constitution to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction in Austria's rating by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of a meeting of ministers in a situation where the Austrian public debt, with its 74.6% high above the criterion of a maximum of 60% set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency had been reduced by just one single degree from the AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest every year,” argued the multi-cancer and foreign minister, the Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria follows the request of the eurozone summit held in Brussels 26. October 2011, where the heads of state and government strongly asked that by the end of r. 2012 the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts was entered into the constitution or the same value law.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to accept such a "rules".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while Länder, as well as municipalities, will have to show a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if it were only to continue strengthening.
"We'll hit it, as we did last time, if we find too much instability" in the yen exchange rate, explained to the Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, it only recurred to the historical values that 31. On October, the Japanese authorities forced intervention.
That day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently broke the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But since then, it has only been regularly supported by investor purchases, who see it as a "safe haven" in uncertain times of the world economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar fell again below 77 yen on Tuesday, falling below the symbolic bar of 105 yen close to the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This flare-up of the Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports as it makes the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the yields earned by Japanese firms from abroad when they are transferred to the domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the ruins caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, Y pointed out. Noda, who fears that this price increase will not yet kill a fragile revival in the egg.
The world's third economic power resumed growth (1.5% in the third quarter) for the first time in one year, thanks to a survey of exports and household consumption growth due to a disaster-bursed household increase.
But the Prime Minister decided that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on Japan's central bank (BoJ), which began a two-day meeting of its political and monetary advice on Tuesday to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's multi-guerror Hirohid Yamaguchi pointed out that the BoJ had previously taken "appropriate measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) and increased the cap of the sums it to purchases of various securities to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates rise, stock exchanges are failing
The risk of contracting the debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European stock exchanges are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone falling into negative expectations on Tuesday 15 November today.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Frankfurt Tax index is losing 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
“With new tensions around the proceeds of eurozone loans that are in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to yield only a portion of recent gains.”
“Nervous investors are only very aware of the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop that it suffered because of market participants' concerns over Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe, and the exchange will continue only a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stable,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This re-launch of uncertainties on the future of the eurozone is damaging the currency itself, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is reaching its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570 at a retreat of 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency backed after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party at its congress on Monday adopted a proposal for the possibility of leaving the eurozone for countries that find themselves in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reaches 6.85% and the yield of Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen the concerns of market participants.
The head of Italy's future government, Mario Monti, has vigorously demanded time in the markets to rectify the situation in Italy at risk of poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of the decisions adopted by 27 October at the eurozone summit will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets when elections to the Chamber of Deputies are held in the country on Sunday.
The rate difference between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new all-time high.
In anticipation of figures announcing the growth of the euro area
Statistical figures say that France recorded 0.4% economic growth in the third quarter, mainly caused by household consumption, i.e. a little better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies, INSEE revised downwards the figures for the second quarter to a 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it's the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
On its part, Germany registered growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the whole euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must triumph over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotion, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that attracts energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographics will trigger a doubling of electricity demand by 2050 if we don’t want to rid a significant part of the world’s population of important parts of life.
At the same time, the shortage of fossil fuels will need to be faced in order to continue to produce electricity, while the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case with Belgium, which subordinate its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which it considers to be the right to build only last generation power plants.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in our projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by resuming the construction of one power plant interrupted after the crash of the Three Mile Island power plant.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts this.
The election of Berlin will be reflected in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be thought about.
The European wind power market champion, of which 30% of its electricity is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher by 65%, respectively. 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay the electricity bill 40% higher than that of the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy, energy costs represent a key competitiveness factor and a guarantee of keeping industry in the national territory, French businesses enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make an illusory, beautiful declarations of re-adjusting our country and the defense of purchasing power.
The price that the great majority of the French refuse to pay, just as it is fundamentally not opposed to this energy, as the opinion polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build up a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 downstream jobs.
The strongly exporting sector is dragging large numbers of small and medium-sized specialised jobs-making enterprises that cannot be transferred abroad to international markets.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a considerable number of these SMEs and would lose 6 billion euros a year that the country receives for exporting nuclear facilities and services.
Which owner of the plant would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while the bankruptcy of its manufacturer would be planned?
When solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magic source for energy production, indeed that there is no evil one.
The development of low CO2 emissions installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industrialised AREVA Group are indicative of the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, absolute need to maintain the highest level of safety is.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent surveillance of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in the blood.
Fifty years from now, the nuclear industry has recognized three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island has taken place in normal operation conditions and remained free of human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused reactor concepts and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this crash as it did with the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities engaged in nuclear safety, operators and designers is that the EPR-type reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those interested in wanting to build a nuclear power plant deem it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to AREVA Group’s competitors and EDF and a easing path to empowering themselves in a leading position in nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration burden or chances for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles - the overbraivation of the police, the courts and the administration subject to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the "country of human rights" that France boasts.
Recently, this was an administrative harassment, the object of which was foreign students, which became topical when the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of May 23) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, bricklayers and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed at the point of the economy.
It must be said that in this area there is a rather broad consensus between the left and the right.
On the right, Jacques Chirac reported to the tone in 1976 with his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where 2 million immigrants are" and on the left Michel Rocard, when in 1990 he said that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of hordes of Polish plumbers on French territory was shared both on the right and to the left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that we are tolerating to provide immigrants.
In its program, François Hollande confines itself to banalities, indicating that joint developments will make it possible to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages, and employment in the countries that accept immigrants.
Restrictions on immigration are crippling growth and harming employment.
Concerns about the effects caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that in reality, immigrants are much more complemented than substitutes for French employees by doing work in sectors with staff shortages.
Fewer qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Like the surgeon, he will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between the French and migrants cause the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that growth in migration movements by 1% will lead to a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And yet it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries on average 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany, one migrant will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) to public budgets in its entire life, 150000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his wish at the beginning of his term to go for the lack of growth with his teeth.
These teeth used to deter immigrants have had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, even though it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century, the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulags, but also Franca in Spain, Salazar, Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some people could have believed that in order for democracy to triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and execute it in the most direct way possible.
But it is known from Napoleon that it was an easy idea.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not a prerequisite, and it can become a “instrument tool” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as it has been and since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The confession of the mistake of the Greek so-no referendum will have the value of a double revelation in this regard: the revelation of the need for a great return of political power, but also to reveal the disturbing sense of his impossibility, his inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought out to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have moved today, and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we require a number of national referendums held according to necessity and disorganized.
Bianko exposed to a European absolutist monarch or a leap with his feet tied into the void of the nationalist depths: what choice for the citizen!
No, we don't want a guillotine knife, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous performance of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which is penalizing against the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are disturbed in the transmission of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe, which is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
The management of the European project of democratic sovereignty must be urgently returned.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, to get rid of the government of the markets and to prepare the future by investing.
The East of the crisis will be foreseeing decisions at the European level that will not be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After fighting for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands the European economic government.
So be it.
But to think it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new folly and a new bleed alley.
We need to take on a new phase of European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
The revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be done by building Europe more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build a Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards spread
In an optimistic atmosphere, the world's smart card fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart Cabinet, 2011 is expected to end with an increase in the world sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM card phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most supportive is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay in public transport or to handle purchases simply by zooming in on the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to rise in 2012 (expected 580 million units) to reach around 10% of the total smart card market (6.925 million cards).
After being in the lift of APEC countries for a long time, Europe acquires the terrain in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But the big retail chains are working for two.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards.
In order to include a higher gear, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
“Two big French businesses have committed to distribute their clients’ non-discussion bonds in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payments
But this is only the first stage to the means of payment of the future: a mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out transactions.
"They've been delayed."
"But their real boom should happen next year."
“For 2012, we estimate their sales in the world at 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing in advance.
Crédit agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test conducted in the city of Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
iPhone devices approximately 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
The BPCE Bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also announced yesterday that she is preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay by mobile phone without contact.
Terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about ties between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-term suspicions that there are ties of the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had "found certainty about it from now on."
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger in January 2010 could help shed light on connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were killed the following day as several of their hijackers during an operation conducted by special French troops.
In the rubble after the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators were supposed to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
Analysis of the calls leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RPI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to the Nigerian, who lived for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to the AQMI and a sect.
“This is progress, but no doubt we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that sects have enjoyed external financial and intellectual support and that they are increasingly appearing more and more actively,” said Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same method of execution as the devices used by the AQMI.
Since then, the international community, for the leadership of Washington, has put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems raised by Boko Haram.
In fact, Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Rapid success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in r. 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of the Haoussa means "Western education is a sin", approves of the founding of the Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a rapid success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters are starting the fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In r. 2009 Boko Haram supporters become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government's reaction is still the same.
The army will surround the city and result in 800 dead.
The founder of the sect Mohammed Yusuf is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group has become radicalized and leaves its place of work in the north.
At Christmas 2010, Jos will carry out an assassination in which 80 people will die, then another in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now worrying all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda of Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and iger and Somalis from the Al-Shabab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said France was on alert and ready to "put all the information."
The world according to the candidates for president
On issues related to China, Iran or to help Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are competing in simplification and ignorance.
Can America weakened by crises manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
When listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think that.
For days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated loud statements and brief guidance on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point of Republicans.
Often unsubstamped slogans about China, Iran or help Israel merge with each other.
Mitt Romney, the best-employing candidate in the Republican "Grand Old Party" nomination"" race, threatened to call the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and their accusations" because of the manipulation of their currency," a main subject in America sparked by migration of entire parts of its industry towards Asia.
All the worse, if this has to contain the trigger of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost crunched in an attitude that “smooths” emotions.
He demanded a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in last places in the election estimates, remains unlistenable.
The image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
“If elected, I will imprison Iran,” he said fanfare.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accuses Obama of failing in his responsibilities to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, proves an embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat because Beijing's "trial to develop nuclear capabilities" - evidently ignorant of the fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against presumed terrorists banned by Obama in r. 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
They're all far away from the one in r. 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and yet he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine on the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya and thus attribute to him the label of the weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population is assessing President Obama's national security policy, which was removed by Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in the military intervention that leads to getting bogged down.
And with the arguments that America needs to be reconstructed economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking in a more correct place.
Nord Stream, a new harbor of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to operate.
It must supply gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new gas pipeline that will be directly united by Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together by the control wheel of the valve of the control input of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will start flowing into Western Europe every year with the first 1-224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the federal state of Mecklemburk-Pomerania.
The second pipe, which must be completed at the end of r. 2012, it will allow the supply of a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is an amount equal to the entire French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly objected to the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow it to deliver gas directly to Germany without being run by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At once, these two countries are losing their power somewhat: the possibility of pushing Russia with the threats of having access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed it the strongest when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", citing the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in r. 1939.
It means saying that this is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained more certainty of its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe energy, because the project created cracks between Europeans from the East and West.
Russia managed barely 5 years ago to assert its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western states with high gas consumption, the deposits of which are coming to an end.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically,” François Fillon confirmed at the opening ceremony of this pipeline, demonstrating at what point large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply site.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The undersea pipe is made of steel with a concrete cladding to protect against the anchors of seagoing vessels.
It rests at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, minefields dating from World War 2 had to be avoided.
“For the safety of them, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted anywhere on its entire length by valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project manager rejected it when the Swedes were little eager to see the Russian state society settle permanently off their coast.
"In the event of a defect, we will stop the passage of gas in less than 1 minute," explains Jens Müller.
In case of leaks, the gas contained in the pipeline leaks into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely to builders, since the welds were designed so that the leakage is created every 100 000 years.
Checking the state of the gas pipeline from the outside is carried out by the underwater robot pulled by the ship, while the inside of the gas pipeline is controlled by the device that circulates inside.
This cougar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
At the end of the journey for the whole three days of the journey at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information about possible deformations of the metal parts.
The remote pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without the need for the slightest repair.
The circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake, remains the lead.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream tasked with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company for five years with a contract that can be renewed, all its gas transport capacities.
“Gazprom will profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of real gas being transported,” said Jens Müller.
Financing of the pipeline construction was secured from 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, the investment costs have risen to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline rises from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the outlet gate of the gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before being transported to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When the full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and in r. 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - branded notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, founded fifty years ago, wants to re-employ the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its leaves of faded white color as if by aged by time.
After all, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
At the time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides to launch a new design, but distributed notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is taking on the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technology "moleskin" (hissness) technique, which is used, for example, for the treatment of the bench surface.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has returned to popularity an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leading brand at Modo Modo Modo.
The success is here.
Sales increased by 26% between 2006 and 2010 to settle on 12.7 million last year.
The situation is far from classified production from the first years, when only 3 000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to assemble some artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook attracts a businessman as well as a student or professionals.
The image of the Moleskine notebook includes that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, has almost a hundred today and has two offices since 2008, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to a bookstore and through a chain of FNAC stores to small boutiques in the centers of cities where he was able to assert his identity.
“We watched the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the tumultuous development of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Capace", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also launched new albums of a notebook reminiscent of leopards.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand expands to a variety of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Molekine history.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
Around 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today it opens 15. A week for the employment of the handicapped.
Through the voluntaristic public policy introduced in r. 2005 the percentage of unemployed disabled people is even twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is it how disliking?
"No, underlines Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Disabled."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not two, but three times higher."
"However, there's still a lot to do."
It must be said that for unemployed disabled people, numerous obstacles persist before they enter work.
These are the elderly: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low qualification: 80% do not have a high school diploma, and of the 2.3 million university students, only 10 000 are handicapped.
And finally - long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the handicapped versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that particularly complicate the return to employment and which represent the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, the director-general of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992, to help businesses accept disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There remains unspoken, ways of thinking that surely develop, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the interviewed managers had a "shom level of knowledge about disabled people" with an "exaggerated notion of persons in a mobile chair and mental or mental deficiencies."
As a result, private businesses with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employing 6% of the disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known numbers that come from r. 2008, they indicate a state equal to 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, in charge of levying fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.
The proof is the number of" fined" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which decreased between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 guilty to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The Law of r. 2005, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers versus 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before they challenge the French national team (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leenkens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to write that there was a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other in the stands of the stands of the stands of the stands of the stands of the stands, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reassure.
Five months after his attacker's angry gesture in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach gave only words of praise to his player.
“I am very happy with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country.”
"I want to move forward," the French Lion player assures.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and the matches of the national team," he says one and the same, he justifies himself.
"I've been in Lille all year, which isn't the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my brand."
Gambling, sparing against Romania on Thursday night over the match against France, is coming to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "shove".
The term “joy” cannot be owesome.
Play against the Bleus, which he has been cheering since the age of 7 and in their victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
All the more so, because opposite them are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We crossed each other immediately."
"I can play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
In a kindness, the Leekens reminded of the "destroy".
"The Pride" to win the "match - a holiday".
The "pride" also state in the quality of "neighbors" that France became a very high-level team again more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna."
"Laurent Blanc did a great deal of work," he skewered.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French in the direction of... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underlined.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're healthy."
"You'll realize it for the next few games." Including against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento is launching a barrage against Bosnia-Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, the two teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. The Portuguese national football team, whose helm has been in 2010, has qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal actually separates from happiness 90 minutes.
It remains to play one match and one opponent - Bosnia.
Conscious of Friday's result (0-0) in the hell of Bosnian Zenica seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of superiority, but it was not able to score such a precious goal that would relieve it.
"It's a good result that, however, contains a risk because we didn't score a goal outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of the audience, which should create a boiling cauldron there, even though the match definitely appears to be "very balanced," says the optimist, but sharply thinking Bento.
“We expect a very balanced match, but we are quite convinced that we can have the upper hand,” said the Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz, the successor to Carlos.
An indecisive match in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score a goal.
“It’s a good result that none of which, however, has a risk because we didn’t score goals outside,” Bento regrets.
“We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the beginning so that they do not give them time to think.
A good idea, on the condition that this time turns out to be realistic.
