The great return of the Czech losers is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who is going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and he could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Pilsen or Russia's Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, and since then he has not yet appeared on NHL rinks.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one stick to the other.
"Pavel Frenchman will be outside for about three to four weeks with an injury at the bottom of his body," the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to the NHL goal was extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, American time was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
He scored 94.5% of the procedures in the AHL.
The offsprest of Pilsen hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year he had problems with his hips and in the shortened pandemic season he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL, "Francis" caught 36 games, his success rate at 92.3%.
Charles puts on a mask on a Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate, as this year's Christmas card, selected a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also posted his wish, using a photo of his wife Camille on the races to help put on a mask.
This was reported by the BBC on its website.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations with whom they work.
Photographs were taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte has a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same as Prince George and Louis Shorts and a T-shirt with a collar.
Who took the photo, William and Kate, did not say, it is unclear when exactly it was made.
Last year, the royal family for a photograph intended as a Christmas card posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood in its country residence in County Norfolk.
The film, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at Ascotcy.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask color-coordinated with light dresses.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminologists allegedly worked in the current corruption case with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr was to have the promised million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
This was reported by the server efotbal.cz, saying that he got to part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, said that the red-and-whites did not commit any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, which from Slavia mainly includes its former sporting director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red-and-whites was in frequent contact with both Berbre and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminologists allegedly worked with the information that Slavia had promised Berbr a financial reward for winning the title.
2019 SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) from the officials of SK Slavia Praha should have the promised million-dollar bribe for the win in the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the Chairman of the Board of Directors Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file no longer follows whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The claimant rejected any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and we offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal conduct, did not seek to influence referees in violation of fair play rules and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," he told Seznam Zprávy.
In the eavesdropping, Nezmar indisputably insults some former Slavia dark-skinned players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match influencing through referees was sparked by police intervention in several places in several places, including the FACR in Prague.
The highest-ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer appears in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, he was released from custody as the former sporting director of Vyšehrad.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the claroval of the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but in principle a worse type (artilleur must be from an armored cabin and carry the cartridges by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, they have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Planes: combat- decent, but at the end of the rental, traffic - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold-war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like this.
I've got the chase right next to town.
Nutrie were crawling out of the river and doing damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down in peace and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came out, but of course the fox went on in a while.
I let her come at 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked himself up, waking the headlamp on all sides, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I got off the sitting, it was gone.
I.e. Even the meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a coincidence to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermal imaging, which almost everyone has today.
So to the visibly place, expensive things to your feet in the spacak and you'd have a cool apartment.
Vojtěch versus Hamas.
The interior has found respirators considerably cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the profession closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns in recent weeks for their acquisition.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts for the respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
Why did others buy the groove?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of iRozhlas, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and armies (props I am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA, which were lost by the older generation), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We do not even have large warehouses of technology that can be done, we do not actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is still more complex, so the ability of reservists will quickly lose in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can put them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And finally, reservist/territorial defenses are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass geril, and it is also an outsped necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, there will be a fight only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have appropriate geography.
We don’t have individual skills.
It's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then there are such situations that you look like a dude who did not hit the empty gate 2 minutes, goes into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say "tvl and what do you think will happen now?".
Well, of course they're taking it as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "spark a defender" is so terrible that I am very frankly surprised when I see that our striker was able to play one player of the opponent.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal for the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the onsling of hospitals will last for some time to come, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is known, a variant of omicron, which is very likely spreading faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by previous illness helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the Covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, an antiviral drug, molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and the associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which of the results so far report a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the first supply of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic has also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As has been said, Merck molnupiravir will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company ended on tape first because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find appropriate treatment for the virus disease of horses on the South American continent.
This research is often neglected that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other end, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are accustomed to speaking "how our beak has grown".
See you'll do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of them will tell you, no.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how they should all help them and how we Czechs are a racist asshole.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, to say this in public means a loss of work and a media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, West good, east bad.
But they'll really find out what people think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmour, both have over 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in the Czech Republic.
Identical because of the spinning of the units, so that soldiers do not have to learn again where there is, so all objects are the same for hair.
One of them is the Brdy Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that sssr did not want to have nuclear warheads in its own territory, either for safety or speed of deployment of warheads due to a more western position.
In those underground shelters (in each maple there are two) only the warheads, not the entire rockets, as they say, were stored.
If it was necessary to put this weapon on, a special unit arrived to pick up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
In addition, the museum maple, they are the remaining ones in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Cigán, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he often showed too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was short of a little, he went regularly, he devoted himself to sports with us, did not steal snacks, or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, he did various monkey shops, but he was fine, perhaps never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, the gypsies entered the same year, other classes.
Shortly thereafter, he beat up a teacher, the police often dealt with something, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an ad (old things, something I don’t need, etc.) and I often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn’t try to make some attempts to stretch me on price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called in a month that he had already rewritten it..
I say in myself that I am not a racist, I do not care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or different, as long as they behave as they belong in polite society (works, works, women do not beat, just common behavior).
But as someone comes, he reaches out his hand, he's going to empty apartments and houses, he's just a mess around him, he's in trouble... so it doesn't matter what color he's, but he'll mind me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved in our country, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs.
Young woman dies in car crash in Prachatice region
“The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot despite resuscitation care,” Zuzana Fajtlová, spokeswoman for South Bohemian paramedics, told Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was carrying the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle probably drove in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for reasons as yet undetermined he drove in the corner into the opposite direction.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and remained wedged in the car.
After the rescue, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and in a stable state he was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice, said rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often do not supply data about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He buys mainly collectible cards.
“Usually it can be tens of dollars, let’s say from ten dollars higher, where it’s still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector said.
Since October, the ordering of small consignments has been slightly expensive, newly he must add VAT and the post office hand over the data to the customs procedure.
He receives an email stating that customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the trader did not include the VAT already during the sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide the customs procedure itself, the total amount must also be added to the carrier's remuneration.
According to Lukáš Neuheisel, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two ticking boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad dropped from 60 thousand to 15 thousand at the international post office in Prague.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to calls for the delivery of data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30 thousand shipments at the international post office, which we have to process.
If people filled in all the data that are needed and would fill in them in time, we would be here about half, Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík said.
Addressing inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% of inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow or offset this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen to what is inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, added (which employee is)?
I was added by 2% in gross this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run at work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists send themselves behind bars for even 6 months?
This does not give me a head just how the court can only send such an animal behind bars for 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that the victim of rape never has to recover from it either.
Doesn't this be discoubing potential future rape of victims?
The Man from the Grave "burned" by his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from the Grave inadvertently helped the officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He summoned them to her.
But he went for it by a click.
At first he approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
Officers arrived at the scene after calling the emergency line and were not surprised when the alleged “robbed” told them that he had made it all up so that officers would come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to advise officers on how to file a notice on the Police of the Czech Republic.
While checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, officers then discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.
A sincere question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are not words ethnically or culturally for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill did not manage to ensure the liberation of Prague of the USA :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not consider such a case to be the true faith.
I can't agree with Pascale here, there is an estimated thing in the world, if I'm not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions.
Which God or Gods should one choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you unfatthily if you believe in another god.
But even in the Decalogue it is that there is no other god than Yahweh.
So wouldn’t it be more rational to refrains from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong choice of the thousands of gods, and the one real god I just missed sends me to hell or to some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training followed by inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per day) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the components of the ACR would be useful to do something like this.
This could be done in collaboration with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being repetitive, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of intermingling, where the workforce migrate from educational institutions into employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process takes place all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, passes from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between a citizen and an army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian raider will never again pick up here.
​I find it funny how you think NATO is something carved into a stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is trouble.
Well, please the lord.
Just one election in the US that will curl their budget and the whole NATO goes into the pussy.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown themselves once that they just need to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works in the long term as a guarantor of independence is the armed army and the population who can control the military technology of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remotely controlled resources, so what could not be done.
We don't need border fortifications, that's for shit today, but a real-grossing teenager behind a stick remote-controlled device can handle.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you expand the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home covered with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of stores has been created that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as a disposable waste.
Anyone can bring to the participating trade (a map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market and also saved money, as the packaging cardboard has increased by 50% in recent times.
In the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such deal is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstore and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and filling material are transported to Popůvky near Brno by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of deferred cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from the home, where to hand over expired drugs, tires, retired electrical, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can end up in the right place, moreover, reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the map of the project contains more than 100 000 such places.
“It is being added to the collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charitable shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
Rather, it seems to me that nowadays the technique is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones generally simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and everything is thrown into one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but above all let them learn something.
Let's reschedule history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency ahead of the weekend – it starts in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the Presidency logo, calling for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they can’t be done in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and voters like it too.
Macron's supporters of straddles between the right and the left agree on little, but they do at Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections of the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready for such work of historians to create conditions.
Many commentators immediately came up with criticism that Macron was concerned with pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it is more likely to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is currently going around France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for one history textbook seriously and look not at the events in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are often learning history as a story we versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, the Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
Movie of the Year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won the award for directing and for best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held the top positions of the audience.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "have the flu/be pissed" A few days I had diarrhea and didn't want to smoke much...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea in the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it that way)

Those who have stayed, and those who have left, know too little about themselves to give it up to life together.
Trains start to run according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains start to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to run instead of Czech Railways.
Most lines are only adjusted for departure time, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
Czech Railways plans to dispatch an average of 6783 passenger transport services per day in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to national connections under the new timetable, the railways will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new timetable, will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main news will be the InterJet trains, which will run on flights from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains of the carrier will be dispatched in northern Moravia or West Bohemia.
From next year, the carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices by an average of 3.2 percent.
Tracks take inflation into their tariffs each year.
The biggest change in the timetable of RegioJet is the entrance to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
After its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, the carrier will replace Czech Railways.
Every day, RegioJet will perform a total of 16 connections on the track, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has retained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned closure work, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar driving times of its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be replaced in some regional lines.
Passengers will wait for passengers, for example, in the Česká Lípa region, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use a single railway fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard, they were dying.
I've never heard teaching from the point of view of a slave party or from that time, no one defends this, he's just condemning.
No one will even tell you in schools that black people were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one will teach you at school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, they will only tell them everywhere how brutally we, Europeans, murdered them, while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the U.S., right in schools, both in northern schools and in Southern schools.
I have not encountered that someone deliberately conceals the facts, but I have heard earlier that it is happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny that (for example, in Japan, atrocisions from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white and that we have a tendency to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History is not interested in someone's feelings, it's just what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the matter from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, speaking of southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some of their good achievements and seemed absurd to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South were slavers, and a lot of things were opposed to them too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, for example, our view does not exist (on YT there was also a video from television, where someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968) was deprived of someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What seemed ridiculous to me in U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that their country has never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that in some universities it was appalling, the students were quite radicalized and those schools supported them many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I feel a little bit sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young is and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that for example, feminism has long since achieved what it had and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
At present, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, so other groups themselves as LGBT, and it leads to radicalization even on the other side, when it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
The more radical someone is, the more you can hear them.
In conclusion, I also did not meet with anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I was rather faced with bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do alone?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If something with people connects me with such interests, views of the world and common experiences, not where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak parish priest is a very nice guy, he has a sermon about theology rather than politics, but then he always eats some cocooline about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact they were born from Catholic modernism and are effectively Catholic without the Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but go to the Hussites, because it is theologically a lot similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická street.
The Church of St. Michala on Dominican Square belongs under the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they make a mass in Latin, as was done in front of the Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the Scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame ignited in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
However, the scouch did not go to Vienna for him due to the coronavirus pandemic, in the morning he was taken over from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal – Břeclav.
It was also taken over at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate in with the club every year, I am looking forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, Skaut Amálie Budíkova told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, the scouch runs by train to Vienna.
Nothing changes the delivery of the flame in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scours traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18, the subsequent light distribution will be taken care of by scouté couriers, who will travel with selected express trains and passenger trains.
From them, the light will be taken over by local scavengers or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flames around the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, the scocks must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's going on like last year.
We make recommendations to those courier teams and the organizers of local events, so that of course they wear masks, try to observe spacing, there were as few as possible, not sing colleagues, simply behaving in such a way that it is as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman of the event of the Bethlehem Light Shot.
The tradition of the light of Bethlehem, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as a flame.
For the believer, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, the light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human mutuality.
All news, including the list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlesssvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidy as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will make good use of the money, I just do not understand why the money is put into agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned, it produces an unnecessary product and it breaks down the free market and the “natural life of the company”.
I work myself in a factory where there are a million boards “xy financed/co-financed by the xy project” in the hallways, and such a company is simply artificially held alive.
This is not the support of the company that gives work to people, this is the braking of development when this company sticks like this and takes away orders/employment to companies that could grow after its demise and be more productive
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age also catches in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think that Internet ads do not rush with me, but then I will get caught up in the fact that they influenced me too - it's just so hard that you don't always resist it.
For this reason, I also support radical votes in the European Parliament, which currently want to impose a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classics - I'd ban the internet.
I have a feeling of this virus root in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that most believe and it makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I prefer to believe something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I will have my own original opinion, which I will say is a covert thought"
2. "I won't believe everything that the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen for the trend of Christmas movies, premiered this year by two hundred
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present a record more than two hundred of them to their audiences in their premiere.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has scored in audiences in recent years and significantly increases the viewership, so these films are being created more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included only those films that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in its title, so there will actually be much more festive films.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are mainly associated with this period, for example, films Alone Home Alone are popular worldwide, Love Actually or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
But the true boom of Christmas films did not start until 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came up with a special film series, the BBC recalled.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films at the time and was very successful.
This year, this station began to tune to its viewers at Christmas 22. October and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
The rival station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-Themes on its agenda this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the sum.
“In this magical period, the story doesn’t matter so much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it’s snowing,” said Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies, with exaggeration.
“For the audience, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace in the middle of all the festive madness and the madness of the world we’ve been living in for at least two hours,” Gray said.
According to him, for example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then it comes about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which, of course, will be successfully resolved and the two of them kiss.
This is how it is over and over again, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch each other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not intervene in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen riders will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and will not intervene until the last race of the season.
The Haas stable will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he won in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from Haas will not intervene in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in the straight battle for the title.
Mazepine, according to Haas, is quite right and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the competent public health authorities, with safety being a final priority for all stakeholders," its representatives said in a statement.
He will not send a replacement rider to the race, nor can he.
A potential substitute would have to qualify or rides at another part of the weekend.
The first competitor does not face covid-19.
At the start of the season just finishing covid-19 was Kimi Räikkönen, last year Sergio Pérez or Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
They can lock you up for this, too.
And everyone will not care that the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhoid.
§ 152 Dissemination of contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of introduction or spread of the contagious disease in humans will be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, prohibition of activity or forfeiture of the matter.
(2) By imprisonment for two years to eight years, the offender will be punished,
c) if such an act violates an important obligation arising from his employment, occupation, status or function or imposed on him under the law, or
(d) if such an act causes serious bodily harm.
(3) By imprisonment for three years to ten years, the offender shall be punished if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes serious harm to the health of at least two persons or death.
(4) By imprisonment for five to twelve years, the offender will be punished if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It is a bit like a portable jewelry store and the creator has put half a year of work into it and all his savings.
“I had a vision of what I want to create, but little experience, in our home sweaters never carried much,” admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours on his work in six months.
He bought silk in Italy, the 24k gold threads in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness,” praises the creator’s work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he sets a world record.
The previous most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720 000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women's, scouts and drone pilots could go before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with border protection with Belarus and the construction of a planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO states, in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise to easily cross the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already active on Polish territory.
The Omicron mutation is spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
“Currently, we have reported further suspicions of this option in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov Elementary School is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county in the week.
“We continue to wait for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,” she said.
She added that these are two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four of them a symptomless course.
No one traveled abroad with suspicion of Omicron
None of these traveled abroad, nor any of their families, nor have there been contact with anyone who would reside abroad.
The connection with the water polo championship is none of the above, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously said that an international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, is being screened.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player fell ill after his return.
California will limit the sale of weapons.
She wants to act like Texas in the ban on abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous state with the help of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial anti-abortion law after the detection of the embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation in the lawsuit of anyone who in California manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms.
The announcement by Newsom responded to Friday's position on the U.S. Supreme Court, which left the Texas ban on abortion in force, even if it goes against the nearly 50-year-old precedent's verdict, which established the right to abortion across the entire U.S. by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court has now not decided on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical issue resulting from the innovative construction of measures.
The enforcement of the ban was brought to public in this case, making the Texas Republicans impossible to challenge him by the usual court.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (of Friday) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which has allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services and has largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
“If states can now block reviews of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that power to protect human lives,” Newsom said.
He said he had authorized his subordinates to work in cooperation with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice on a measure authorising representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called weapons of spirits.
This is how home-made weapons are labeled that do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10 000 (over 220 000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who would produce, distribute or sell assault rifles, components to “misorship” or a set for their production in California.
“If it is the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets, to create a threat of private lawsuits, then we should do exactly that,” the governor of California said.
California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state would now renew the ban using the Texas template, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court, Sotomayor, would be confirmed, who warned of the extension of the legal mechanism to other U.S. states in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict.
However, the Supreme Court has not granted Texas’ bans on abortion has granted full immunity to judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against selected U.S. officials.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination schedule will look like and also improvements to the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already rolling out from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to five times an increase in antibodies, which already has a long-term effect.
Just like any other vaccination will have its vaccination schedule after a while, it's just too early.
Another fact is that in a short time a new vaccine should come to the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10x more efficiency.

Poland threatens to halt payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act in violation of the law if it exercised new powers and, due to a dispute over the rule of law, halting the payment of money to Poland.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for the use of 36 billion euros from the EU fund to renew economies hit by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and to apply a mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries violating the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU by veto in all matters that require unelect," Ziobro, head of the Solidarity Poland small party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable given that the EU is unlawfully denying us the funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in the approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes taken by the Polish judiciary for Ziobra’s activities threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is building “implicable conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw is facing “political dictates carried out by extortion and trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
“We will never agree that Poland should have colony status,” he said.
But to know about it... In Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at the other things, I met one yogurt more times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and I asked.
They had it, that's right, in the narrow sector were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is a avoided, I will not even smell any market, events of non-actions, gold shop in the square, maybe they do not have such a choice, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I have ten minutes done.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've been watching data treated here as manly data, most vaccine opponents are just a little bit more out of the spot than most proponents of vaccinations.
Rational discussion takes place at the professional level, but only extreme opinions come into the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccinations will save us, vaccination is useless.
To ban everything, to allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analysis.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it like this, and we've got it this way.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states, no one solves.
Ugh, so I was relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day to all of you.
I was punished with a spoocher in childhood.
It was never because of grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and naughty (read instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened at first that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after another "catch" the sausage only brought the spoon and laid it down to see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few shots on my ass (over clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial, because the child responds to them much more than to words.
What is important, in my opinion, is the part with a warning, because it gives the child a choice whether he/she will not listen and get better, or he will improve and the punishment will not be.
In the end, I usually only had to be warned to listen.
System defense
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, in 1999, answered the journalistic question of what the Czech Constitution meant to him – whether the sacred charter, on which he swears and that he learned from childhood in school, or, conversely, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first concept.
We once agreed in a constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we as the state and its citizens are, and it is better to save them with change.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed over the question at the time.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
Years are tested by situations that its creators (which Vojtěch Cepl belonged to) could not foresee, for example, with the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right on one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference with their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then it can be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, an order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid does not choose, in the University Hospital Brno they fight for the life of a multi-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder for children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with mainly recently.
“We know that children are endangered and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesussiology and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told the News.
The course is considerably simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are severely sick with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Really very severely ill children with coronavirus have been on the ARU lately.
Children with post-covid syndromes were on the ward, according to the doctor, continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires staying in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects alongside both adolescents and several months' baby.
There are also children in hospitals in severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“A child is currently with us for several months of age,” the head physician said.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths have been recorded in the children's hospital of the University Hospital Brno for the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominik, in the children’s hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – is an integral part of the cooperation of a psychologist.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, vaccination relieves the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
“That’s why we recommend applying the vaccine in children as well,” the doctor added.
In the quiet zone you can only walk along marked paths.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
You can see on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the rest zone you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the field).
skiing/riding a bike in the forest outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it does not look too much outside the national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
Music is in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
It is breastfed by the Liberec Opera and originally played on the horn of the French.
As a singer, he can sing practically all the repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberec Theatre F. Šalda, but also in Pilsen, at the Josef Kajetán Tyla Theatre.
He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic Orchestra, the film Philharmonic or the Symphony Orchestra in the Giant Mountains.
China builds the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better.
China went on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected criticism for failing to stop the contagion that had turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero increment of the infected.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors have many to help fight the coronavirus, including Italy’s worst affected.
How to see Beijing’s willingness?
Is it a friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
Meet a friend's friend and says to him, look, don't you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
My wife likes to be grappling with grass, she washes the car with his trunk, the children play with him.
Well, just great.
If you want 5000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: let's slap ourselves, it'll be great...
After a while, they meet and the one he bought complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn, the giant shit, the car has saddled everywhere, the children are fighting it, and his wife wants to get a divorce.
The one who sold says: You talk badly about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that...
World affairs are dominated by the powers.
Although equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a superpower if it works on its integration.
In the meantime, it operates at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the moods will be different and it will happen.
It also occurred to me, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm saying a word.
I'm just stating that the ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary on “Spanish oranges and mandarins”, when it is clear that these are both from Spain, while in “Spanish fruits and tangerines” it is not clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I pride it on the fact that the phrase is “all American forces” including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect it to be included in the broad term and there is no need to specify it further with the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just verbs :D
Either way, it's a nonsensical demand

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey of cosman Milona
The terrifying footage shows the moment the frightened monkey crouched in the toilet bowl before her heartless owner washed her away and laughed at her.
Hollande also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent City Court has now banned her animal husbandry for life, The Sun reported.
Experts in the rehabilitation of monkeys who take care of Milly after her abuse have said that they had never seen such a terrified cosman before.
Milly spent nearly two years of rehab with Monkey World workers in Dorset and is now playing happily with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The four-time mother pleaded guilty to two allegations of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Gwent City Hall, she was sentenced to a twelve-week imprisonment sentence with a suspended sentence of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was given a lifetime ban on keeping animals and having to pay 12 000 crowns of court costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue."
Milly took time to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she has settled and is happy with the male, her view of the new people can still cause panic.
Psychic scars from abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage of the woman's phone after a raid in her apartment over drugs charges.
In the footage, you can hear Milly vulgarly swearing.
In another video, Hollande is being heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, “Do you want cocaine?”
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, admitted to possession cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her home, cocaine was found for £16,000 (less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Hollande was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from that prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're gonna take the same things in your freshman year like in the sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of bifling, when no one, honor except, does not care whether you can do it or understand.
Just write a test for 1 and then no one cares about it anymore.
Go and on the street randomly ask people whether to manage to determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
Everyone went through it, and the absolute majority won't even cross it, and they'll tell you they're absolutely in their pussy.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I am a big fan of general overview, and the reality is that people do not want and have no need.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it in them anyway.
Partly it's taught for a lot of people who's going to need the thing.
But just like, the remark that you don't really need all this for standing by the machine, I was absolutely serious... because you just don't need to.
In addition, we are slowly getting to the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(This is probably also our communist past and incited against the educated and elites) But the price of the barbarians standing by the barbarians in these machines is simply high.
If the journalists could count, Covid probably never reached that size.
Wedding at first sight: The war of Kadri and Andrea continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to inquising questions from curious fans, who so disappointed her about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social media.
It's been squeaky between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea moved to her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only ended in love, but rather grew into mutual misrepresentation and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he was angry with Kadri in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged sincerity now didn't like his older sister Linda either.
She decided to defend her brother publicly.
Normally, I don't comment on such things at all, and even in the family we never said too much of these things.
I don't want to make any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, she just won’t give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was young at age.
All the more I regret is when I have to read such untrue information that is probably quite taken out of context.
I would love to know everyone as much as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in the confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above everything and know reality and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the façade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what.
He started his robbery expedition Cchao in a parking lot in a residential area where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he could think of nothing better than climbing the 5th floor and climbing into the apartment through the open window.
He stole two bananas.
In the footage from one security camera, he is then captured walking down the street away from the scene of the crime and eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She subsequently intercepted Cau.
The man confessed to having drunk something alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to plough in drunk.
The whole thing is still in the investigation.
The drunkard climbed the façade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and effective to the pandemic emergency.
When it is abolished, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business
Is that not enough for you as a reason?
The right of assembly will be restricted, but not abolished.
More than 60% of voters came to Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
New councils on Saturday voted in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and in Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils fell apart here.
99 candidates applied for a total of 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
The elaboration of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes for us a rather demanding, but successful year.
It held a total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said the Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 outbreak, the elections were more demanding on equipment and personnel security.
In Komeň in the Uherské Hradiště region, the Association of Independent Candidates won 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member assembly won.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means winning two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, 18.52 percent of voters gave them their vote.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, also got into the council again.
The communion – independent candidates – reached one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent Candidates 2 went to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62%.

It won 56.73% of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second one was the candidate of the Municipality for the People, which gave a vote of 43.27 percent of the electorate, so she will have three representatives in the council.
76.7% of voters came to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region were won by independent candidates Hope for Nová Ves ahead of the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, winning four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12% of the vote and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, won a more mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9% of voters.
On Monday, the results of the elections will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign policy?
I think all this people here are writing well, you know.
You're just pretending to be a fool to have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to look good).
I don’t care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the Church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money she has made, the suppressing of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, e.g. the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: Believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell head down from twelve meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, who was hit by rescuers of the Regional Emergency Medical Services.
The staff of the regional operations center took an hour after midnight on Saturday afternoon an emergency call with initial information about the fall of the man from a height.
Two EMS crews – medical and medical.
Upon arriving at the scene, medics discovered that the twenty-seven-year-old man should have fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the moment of arrival of the emergency services teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation, and after further measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance carried him to further care of the Ostrava trauma center, the spokesperson of the EMS MS region, Lukáš Humpl, spokesperson for the EMS of the Czech Republic, informed.
More concerns than coronavirus are of inappropriatory reactions from the public and authorities
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but on the front line of the fight against the disease stands mainly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask the military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes Falls After Seven Years, Oliveira Defends Belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things were happening at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to beat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who did not find a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in a light vase, performed great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also won by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept away Cody Garbrandt with the technical KO in the first round.
He also defeated Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
This was brought by a bantamweight women's struggle between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Penova.
The American woman entered the battle together as an imaginary "dwarf", because Nunes did not lose for seven years and grinded her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the way to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced to make any more mistakes and she unsuccessfully tried to attack herself with a hand lever.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents were expecting a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Peňová got Nunes to the ground, where she began stranding her.
She had to give up trying and tapping the attack.
The American woman made a huge shock to everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the light-welterweight title.
At first, Poirier was better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to beat his opponent with a lever on his hand.
He did not succeed, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and covered him with a series of blows.
He won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear naked choke, whose Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to knock the strangulation away.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, he claimed a confident triumph of Sean O'Malley, who already put on the hard right back on Rauliana Paiv in the first round.
He then remanded him with a series of precisely aiming strokes and recorded his 15th triumph.
Kara-France was then able to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip, or the hip?
At first glance, it is nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical genus, and it is therefore not difficult to determine whether it is a male, female or medium genus.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns, for which the genus is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two families.
When inclined, they then acquire double endings and in some cases remain in an inclined form.
For example, the words “savior” or “skier” are male and female, in the first one they are bowed according to the pattern of “machine”, in the second according to the pattern “song”.
For the next group of nouns, the different shapes are already in the first fall of the single issue, such as: “line/line”, “kedluben/kedluba” or “brambor/brambor” (in the sense of food).
Both shapes are standard, they have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, such as the “cucumber” in the Czech Republic and “cucumbers” in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-writing, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: “mood” and “trip”, “dish” and “drabs” and “drabs”, etc.
Some of the words that have penetrated the Czech language from other languages were originally inclined, but they gradually adopt the Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is male and female, or the word "buffet", which remained in the middle genus in the middle genus, but in the male one has endings according to the model of "honest".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like at the Greek border?
There are tensions on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants attempting to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to venture into the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians are promising Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to travel uncertain?
What does the situation look like on the spot?
We haven't seen the blue sky for three months and we've choked, Sydney journalist says
The devastating fires, which Australia have been struggling with for the fourth month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do the local authorities and the residents themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic impacts, as critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with how sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don't know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and I have experienced how their surroundings or even the police often treat these people.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend has happened that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But he keeps too many people to himself.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations is fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you only help sexual abusers.
Czech Republic flooded houses under construction, families have no money to finish
Building material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people have found themselves in a difficult situation because of this.
It does not have the means to complete the built-up family houses, and banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of the material, the price of construction work is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete the already unfinished family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move into unfinished and unoccupied homes.
In the worst case, uninhabited houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of it happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to comply with some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they were counting on the fact that the construction of the house would cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň added.
The most out of the material was copper, iron and plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labour.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of graduates of construction disciplines, and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of the building permit is more favourable.
“The construction authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” Křeček said.
We're doing well and we're going to get even better.
But the real vision is missing, says the commentator of the Czech Republic – myRadio
In addition to classic celebrations, the entry into the new year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO chairman Andrej Babiš, and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, as well as the President of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, spoke to the nation.
What important things have we learned?
As in this I find the diploma super just, I have my own topic, which I chose, I follow up on the bachelor's, I always work on it all year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
The state exams are completely calm in our country, unless a person is a total macaque and something is left in his head, then the committee will not stifle him unnecessarily on the theory.
For example, I was studying for a week at the state exam, and when I was finished, the commission always tried to guide me to some logical derivation that immediately came to me and I had it right.
Otherwise, to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we have done it a lot, really beneficial, they teach a lot) and then they just learn the project and they have taken care of.
In my opinion, it is great when at the end of the subject there is an exam, which reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
All bits don't overwhelm emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same dick as they are.
Those people in the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something might happen to them.
But you can possibly build a statue of a Putin statue next to the statue of the Pooh bear.
Maybe put it in a way that he's going to hit Xi Jinping on his ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws the artists under the feet of the artists.
As soon as you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
In addition, it still changes what is more important for the feature, whether like, comment or save.
It's been messing with me lately, so maybe I'll have to go back to the tiktok, where a lot of artists from my industry are successful and they can't almost let it happen.
In the end, I might even be glad if something came in a user-friendly, which does not suck out artists all the creativity and energy
Statement by the Party of Workers in Donbass
The union – yes, breakage – no, opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-down of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Białowield Forest, 8 December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Šuškevich, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum on March 17, 1991, with an open indulgent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "The Union of the SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
In one cut, the pens have "downbreaked" a huge country with nearly three hundred million people.
By the disintegration of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens have found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia’s population has declined by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, for one session in the Belovige Forest, destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, paved agriculture, tore away from the world's largest power fourteen republics, which had previously been economically united into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the poor population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion into the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of the geopolitical surrender, the surrender of the socialist camp first.
There is such a concept in political science as the “vacuum of power”.
Everything that has been betrayed and renounced in a hurry, quickly filled and conquered NATO countries that embraced our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it with the fact that I put it in the fridge and make it out of it on Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality, in which I will not buy meat on Monday, the chain will be cheaper to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe the mechanism by which the meat will make the meat a burden on my digestive system?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the expiration date - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK more and left it in my refrigerator for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These bullshit about the fact that when something is cheap, it must be bad, spoiled or poor quality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass of the ladies handed out some brochure, I always take similar things to help the brigadiers, they can not throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views of the world's workings, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be some kind of agitation.
After reading it, I found who published it and eventually the Scientology came out of it.
Well, like he was a good stuff, full of completely useless precepts, like I'm supposed to wash myself and not be a pussy.
Too bad paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be felled.
I've been through something like that with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you satisfy that person because you like him without realizing how much the situation is in the [**deli.
Several times she threatened me with the hurt because of it I went with a friend who didn't like to talk outside.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and on her knees begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
About a year it was a great relationship but then it went another half a year and began to tile on the head.
Then I ended the relationship with that from the one I said from me breaking up and lied to her but we can talk about it next week to reassure her and not catch a lot.
Such a person sucks out of you feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Prefer to keep the distance
When insurance companies are furiously stealing from buying a cloud of tests and a hurry for positives who wouldn't even know about the terrible illness hadn't even known the test.
The only thing we achieve is a complication for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator have been killed five days of house arrest.
In the west, they have already stopped with the joke, acknowledging that there was no point in dealing with the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new and has to steal something and drive his ego by inventing hazing.
I see a good old man coming back to us again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is once again returning to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), initial promises about training products and business skills quickly flipping into "this does not interest you, especially get people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer, because I wanted to help people, but the training was more like frightening and chatting a person.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if you wanted to earn, you have to whistle a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only earning, so a person felt like a door-in-house seller of pots.
But what I can say, the experience was valuable, one learned that you should not jump on every bacon and thoroughly examine the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even benefiting people, but they will certainly not boast of expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
In the corporation where I do, I haven't experienced many things like that.
HR is calm, managers look at their management and don’t put their noses in anything.
So the regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form that it is quite possible in our country (set some goals for another year, in a year we will look at what came out and what didn’t) – it’s more of a self-assessment than that someone would judge you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events also optional.
But we are also a little unique in our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you feel like we're such a near-startup that squatting in the offices of a big corporation no.
But it doesn't bother us much as they do as long as there are results.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police searched to no avail for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in his resignation Jakub Kulhánek on social media that the woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With family in mind, we will not disclose more information about the case.
My condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on the bus while traveling from work, before she was getting her money from the ATM.
Her disappearance was announced by colleagues from work five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for it, Interpol ranked her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man in this case a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspects, but did not disclose it.
In four municipalities at the end of the year, new councils gave themselves
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils fell apart here.
99 eligible candidates applied for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were married.
The average age of elected councillors is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 lists of candidates have been registered for the new elections to councils in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The elaboration of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes for us a rather demanding, but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-Chair of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
It took me a while to cope with the fact that we have quite dangerous contagious illness at the very beginning, but it went without any major snags.
Coping with how idiotic a large part of the population on all its strata is, I have a problem with that until now.
I am most looking forward to vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to him I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not an asshole.
He would be stripped of his post as president and reclaim her eligibility.
The chances that this will really happen is, but as the others mention here very small.
Moreover, I am not sure that the cartoon of the file could be considered treason at all.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic will endanger the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex all year is growing
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who renounces sexual life rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 have said they had no sexual intercourse in the last year are more than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals, the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) survey showed.
One of them may be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less priority for young people, could also contribute.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 has been growing rapidly, stating that they had no sex in the previous year,” said Lyman Stone, an IFS researcher.
In marriage, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% of them reported in 2021 that they have been without sex in the last year.
In the case of single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The loss of sexual activity is also contributed by fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people share their opinions about premarital sex, about 30% are worth it bad, while about 70% think it's okay.
“It’s true that among single individuals in this age group, they’re a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend,” Stone said.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason for religious is a religious establishment.
Since 2008, singles under the age of 35 who participate in religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to 60%.
Among the "less believers," the trend rose from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and, most importantly, social drinking during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activities.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is less in people out of work, or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby “replacing” this need.
This trend has taken hold mainly under lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole order of vaccination against covid is about whether society should force part of the population to behave that they do not want, but which can save their lives.
It is quite a difficult question, on which I personally are most interested in the question of social conscience.
The question, for example, whether if we don't order them to do it and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he couldn't get inoculated and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that it is to blame for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who here, alongside the SPD and the Communist Party, is saying something about bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly inferred that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the other group, so they will actually be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, the weather is complicated even by the preparation of the Jizera Fifty cross-country skier.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will be the lack of snow to fight drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it's not about the owner.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across the city to a shipyard so we could take a boat ride on a boat.
On the way there we went one rather wide street and who we probably do not see in the middle - supporters of the sect Hare Kṛṣṇa.
Of course they fell on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but with one friend, they started talking.
When she left them, we asked her what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of them, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
There's not so much going on, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw after previous visits to Paris and Brussels on Sunday, where he was greeted by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept a violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis, caused by the troubling movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, is advisable to resolve with the use of diplomatic negotiations, including within the “Normand group”, which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and a weapon, because night after night we are recording a hundred attempts to cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor, so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we have decided to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
Drunken Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was driven by another nun, who was trying to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose his driver's license for not giving priority in driving and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle, asking her for help.
The police then came to see her sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and after they found out that she had over two mille in her blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, they told her that she would be responsible for her actions in court.
The dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Shaymovic, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen themselves in American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After the kitschy film f. Brabec Gump - a dog that taught people to live, now another film Here We Watches Over the Audience Emotions in Cinemas.
Co-author of the screenplay and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows his previous film Here Watching Me from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some of the familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, who dies, so they start inviting dog walkers, Julia's father with her partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director with his partner Beatriz Šajomicová (which is also the producer of the film) dealt with the procedures of storytelling in the previous dog film, but at least children and the dog enjoyed at least there.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, is subjected to namarial delusions in the desire for a child, and if he comes the right “constetation”, he copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates she will determine – on the bonnet of a car or a church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia), who falls into the hospital.He could have played a miraculous process of healing by the dog.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what content pelmel full of unreliable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a competition of dog owners, a Šumava scarlet, cops arriving at the denunciation to look for “drugs” and discussing over herbs about the fertilizing strength of bone meal – and which the baked family in the guesthouse, of course, gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and then sits on a suspended and make-up with a cigarette at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and slack as a cured vegetarian, you can't not laugh.
On top of that, he explains to the viewer that “sometimes it happens after a coma.”
The team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build live-action situations, a sense of character characters and a point and directing.
The performances are unbalanced, the cut is clueless and the overall impression is stubborn.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their party, they have little to play.
The only positives of the film remain the poetic shots of the Šumava nature of the cinematographer Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to outline several figures, a flimsy plot and a dog catchphrase, let alone more popular vulgar expressions that the characters commit.
The argument is not even an old membership in the Club of Grazage Breeders - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man with a dog must also be knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family film, there's a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurish piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swear words from jerks like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here you see how you understand it, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want to, the answer will always be not.
If you listened to kids like that all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in the case of a job to earn extra.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time it was raining.
“The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we recorded at some stations, is unusual,” Israel’s Meteorological Service said.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports for November only six percent of the long-term rainfall average.
The two-day rain from this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It wasn't raining in long.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, the resident of Nazareth, Wasím Aškar, rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, they are shock and irregular.
There are forests dependent on winter rains.
They dry out without them and are susceptible to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to the three last rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been going down.
Water managers have warned of drought a long time ago.
“It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall could decrease here,” said Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital, Amman, there are more and more tank cars.
Water supply and private wells are drying up.
“This year, my orders have risen by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years,” said Imad Suleiman, the driver of the tanker car.
Clashes have erupted in Iran's Isfahan between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed of the local river was completely waterless.
The region has had the Driesest November in many years.
Israel is preparing military action against Iran
The Israeli Defense Minister said that negotiations in Vienna had "no progress" and that he informed Washington of preparing an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who is residing in the U.S., is trying to persuade Americans to escalate their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna had "no progress" and the world's powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About 3 years ago, this happened to me.
I called the lady a little bit and grilled during the interview to find out what she wanted me to do.
Finally, I found that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I was annoying the lady for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a thug, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, awaited a lot of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of those interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow, and some ski resorts have started operating.
The skier was not discouraged by the obligation to prove himself with the lifts with a Covid certificate.
While ski lift operators do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to cross-country trails and on the slopes at the weekend.
The skiers were good for the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so the perfect, did not save the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccant or are within the deadline after having had covid-19.
With few exceptions, people are ready for it and are proving themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told the Czech News Agency.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Some rentals and ski equipment stores are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
It expects more onslaught during the ski courses.
Also, the managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, David Shinták, feels that due to covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, Šinták told the Czech News Agency.
According to him, people were lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the rental company in the Novako area on Boží Dar is experiencing a great demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested now have to order them in advance.
“We start lending the runs this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the complex.
According to her, the interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people who don’t have any property here are going abroad.
The owner of the company does not really leave abroad.
But completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began in such a way that one beautiful day the Orbán won, the year ruled, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is elections.
If you live here badly, there can also be a traditional V4's madman.
Young and educated will leave, leaving its supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
Terrifying photo!
Langmajer in blood for betting on beer?
While in the Czech Republic it was in full swing autumn, in Thailand the crew of the film Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a makeup for filming?
London police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on the way home.
“Petra’s disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her,” Lucy O’Connor of the Lambeth police department where Srcen worked said in a video on Saturday.
“Even her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her work at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell district.
The last time she was reportedly spotted on a bus was about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her collaborators.
According to British media, Src was a “sisters of nurses assistant” at the Evelina London Children’s Hospital, which belongs to the Guy’s and St Thomas hospital.
“We have enormous concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the report continued.
MP Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the Srns at a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"He has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photo of a woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find it because she was out of her home country, away from her family, and working here for our health care,” Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e., about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like that either.
These are not "huge quantities," but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of the Invasion and starting to get fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what he thought Russia wanted war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is off at so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare it with the first Punic war and "andex" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all that, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to that.
Ono, pacta sunt seranda...
New timetables have been in place in Prague since Sunday, they will mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are expecting several changes since Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop in the station Zahradní Město.
In the suburban train transport, the S7 trains will run through the Prague Main Railway Station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The recently launched station Praha-Zahradní Město will be newly stopped by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be newly extended to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines with an overlap in the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions, will be incorporated.
During integration, 77 lines will be closed, 37 new ones will be introduced and operation will be adjusted to 12 operating.
A new bus line 405 will leave Zličín in Prague, which will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague – Kralovice near Rakovník was created, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and on the weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník, when the express line number 404 will newly leave.
Newly, lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are included in the PID system.
They leave from the Střížkov metro station, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 goes through Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the operation on the ten Central Bohemian local lines, including Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, is newly cancelled or restricted.
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín continue.
Changes are also waiting for passengers at other locations.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is extended with continuity from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The route of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region has undergone a change and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region are modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do 9-5 classic with a 30min break and my only option to get a meal is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and quickly buy a maximum pizza bun and yogurt and apple for a snack.
Q: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in a supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so it is.
And these are not trees that you need to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If it is damaged, the tree can be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason they're forbidden to ride off-piste, but it's one of them.
Confessions of Darai about the relationship with Nedvěd: I was not looking forward to this at all
Czech show business pond since Friday lives by nothing more than revealing the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been dragging on to it since the summer, and the famous footballer even got a divorce from the singer.
Dara has now sent fans a comprehensive message explaining why she had kept the love from them for six months.
“I would like to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who misses that Dara caught a bear, i.e. pardon, Nedvěda,” jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer up to her ears.
He said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are a bit a bit a bit of interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who don't care at all and pop up on them even from the can, or we whose lives are expanding in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are quite right, or you insisted that everyone really know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's an arito, that's what you want, it bothers the Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare their new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has long served as vice president of the Juventus football club.
They went out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for the culmination of Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they have not been married on paper for only three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man, and as he does to me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins closed.
Hi, the other commentators have probably said everything important, I just confirm that the tracks are great to start, my classmates usually met and became friends during the first semester or two and then found the subletting together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
The apartments usually do not advertise very long in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but looking at the offer certainly doesn't hurt.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surroundings (street like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., this is a bad enough address), some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is a lot of student, King's Field and in that direction it's fine, besides, it's close to most of the colleges of the BUT (I don't know exactly where you start).
I have never been looking for rent, but I am a native Brno, so I can possibly advise Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
This is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it from their own or let them go according to the state and pay the state.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he will bid a few crowns in the full-fledged state contribution and thanks to this he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim somewhat loses weight when it is written by a person who, two days before, has expressed himself in this way about the petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So the voice against it if someone goes to an abortion is for you the same as a voice against a statue standing in the square?
I'd consult your apartment directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing/digitalization that (even long-time professionals) it either somehow throws it away from the eye, or they write something like xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and in the note that it is illegible.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite legible, so I probably wouldn't quite recommend it.
Personally, I would probably deal with it in a note by what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and hardy student, you can look into some sign databases and search for the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess the author or printer simply created his own character, which fits what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn’t it more of an Odry Empire (kingdom) than OdryNská?
PSS: Someone's been cracking this place.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
This is a much worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea of being approved because no one understood a text is laughable.
All the important documents approved are examined by word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that is the matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relations.
Moreover, with the English, it is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for the third year running and it's been fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10 p.m. and never any problem?
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly tamed there in their lives.
Yeah, most of the Romani population of Brno probably live there, but all they do is interfere on the sidewalk and park where they don't have :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb the street there in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I'd go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly refurbished or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and the lover Gelemová as a stake in the fence!
Who will they spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the Advent wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dada's wreath, and Lucie certainly has one, said the saxophonist to Blesk, who so confirmed Patras's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but he does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
The Slovak still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Annie, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGOTH AWIT!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOG) TOG)
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dada and Lucie, probably perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of a music video for the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was glad to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is strategic enough that the aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain?
I don't know any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few cops and they can not afford it, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else such a high percentage of health-trained people are not at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend just Ostrava goes to the head of the previous governments, not the army, it has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought period in recent years.
According to scientists, the water has decreased in mountainous and foothill areas, with smaller rainfall recording places where there has been no shortage of moisture.
The cause of the drought, which prevails in much of Central Europe, is climate change.
However, the impact is also enhanced by the way we manage the land.
What to prepare for in relation to drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's going to be like that, I can barely stay in skates on the ice, mushrooms I know what's playing hockey and the tactic (what I've tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a hallucination overall.
And whether you are the hockey team of "couch Russia" or "lama China" so lose by two goals, even if you do not have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is compared.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who point out, what the referees notice, whether male or female hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably with all the sport, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way it is as it always is otherwise, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it won, it would probably be a classic "voni lost" vs "We won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34 451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are at 100 000, 871 per 100 000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily number from 13. October.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "unavoidable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, dr. said on television on Sunday. Susan Hopkins, chief medical counselor for the UK Health Security Administration.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Omicron infected people are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after the infection and deaths about three weeks after the infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing last December when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government secretary defended the quiz had taken place "virtually," over a computer.
However, it was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the prime minister's office is growing.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was put in place in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Two years ago, Boris Johnson won the overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of prime minister.
Remarkably, how quickly the events evolved.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is facing elections in the spring that can end Viktor Orbán’s twelve-year government.
It will be an election of pan-European importance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be single, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to profit from it, and makes other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one so far is that everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to bind voters from the determined districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it did in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is significantly different.
It was a matter of it before, not if Fidesz would win, but how much and if it will have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and mandates.
This is a great unusual thing for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they be even harder in trying to keep the power to play?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the president of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, has leaked into independent media, where she tells the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these signs of a new approach that you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of those news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my parents my mom doesn't have much patience, neither does I, my dad has a long time, but then she bangs extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was angry as a child terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a spasm and was all blue, they took me about twice under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes they smacked my upbringing, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things by force, as a child I struggled quite a bit, now I at least hit something for a discharge and as a younger one I have been slapping my parents so over my hand (to not get much through my ass), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I can't tell the extent to which it is my explosiveness, but certainly the education has a share in it.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is just wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer “educational”, but from frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just fucks something, it is probably not possible not to at least give a little fun to their children, so I do not blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws are to be clear and unequivocal.
So I would call Kundoumi those who make up laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of an income loss?
Is it really possible to count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay for the mortgage from?
Coach's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of the four defendant of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It also moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connection to the leaders of Slovak politics and justice.
How important will the process for Slovakia mean?
This is hugely the fault of the journalists.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the anti-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day, two later?
No, they let themselves go, and the company was jumping.
Czech TV was dying with Covid six months ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally recast
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting the deep geological repository of high radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the government interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted to the government after years of delays by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against deep-sea storage, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-government expects the law to strengthen their options significantly in the decision-making of the repository, as promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will rework the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is accusing municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of a site for a repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Repository Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of the specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal of the substantible intention almost completely omits the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of municipalities practically mere statists in permitting proceedings.
The design lacks system adjustment of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for storage, its permitting and operation.
According to today’s legal norms, municipal leaders do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a place for a repository.
Only in certain permit proceedings may they submit their comments or appeal, but decides, however, the Office or Minister in whose interest it is the authorisation to issue.
Any action does not have suiciary to carry out exploratory or construction work.
The co-decision of the self-government that the Platform is asking for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those where they have already progressed in the permitting of storage, as in Sweden or Finland.
Moreover, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by the CORAO and related to contracts with attorney Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is expected to be almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, Vice-Mayor of the municipality of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson of the Platform Against Deep Repository, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who were just squenting the settlement of the position of self-government to state authorities in the search for a deep repository of high-level radioactive waste, we are waiting for a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction similarly as the directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against deep geological repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to push through a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep geological repository.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of the site for possible storage is subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actress John Goodman (69) forced to lose weight fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted about his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of The Freak Brothers.
From the fat man from the sitcom Roseanne, he's a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to crack.
“I put everything in my mouth,” the actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Moving, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit in place anymore, he told ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on which boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from the game environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text and perhaps university text, I would probably look for how to describe or explain the boss.
There are more kinds of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls, etc. has a number of bosses, right, and so is "boss" something like a master / ruler of the given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden boss (super boss, hidden boss) who are not at all needed to beat the game or level to be completed, but often they are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are Half-Life games, where the bosses are, but the player does not directly compete with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called anyway?
And then they're mini bosses.
The general one-word somehow translating the boss somehow can not be translated, the Czech language and other languages somehow do not solve it (it is interesting just Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game generally significant, computer-controlled, an adversary stronger than all the previous and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for missing Peter from London.
The Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for missing Petra Srnc since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
She has been looking for a 32-year-old woman from Uherské Hradiště since December 7.
At the same time, through Interpol, it helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol released the so-called yellow circulator for it.
Peter is looking for the whole world.
“The Czech police are working closely with the British police,” police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová said.
"We share information on the case," she added.
The search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, she is skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherské Hradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse at one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The search for Petra was also involved in the search for Petra.
She got involved in putting up leaflets with Petra's face.
"We are hugely worried about her," she said at a news conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
But it is not clear who he was and what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by the Tesla Agent.
While the data in October pointed to a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month, with the end of the year approaching, the attacks significantly intensified.
We saw a big campaign with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to attract the attention of the user with the name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment in the name had the word invoice, this time it was marked as a Copy of the receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of ESET.
Spyware contains features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code is actively searched for the saved credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the upcoming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
The Spyware Formbook was also active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured rather campaigns with global reach.
Compared to October's data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but continues to be behind almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook contained the most common attachment with the .exe extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt also appears.
The appendix in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decrease and dampening of the activity is recorded by security analysts in the Fareit program, which was worth 1.6 percent of the attacks and had no major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
The today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated jerks.
The procession through Prague was greater than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the embankment and in my experience of the demonstrator, I am not afraid of an estimated 10 thousand people.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means that people really a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by are spontaneously added to the procession of about four thousand demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to finding common ground.
Only anti-vaxers themselves, anti-masks and co. could not fill or pay such a large procession.
The event of the association Chcípl Pediasis has an upward popularity, it reminds me of a Million Moments for Democracy inside out.
Sometimes I have the impression that they rent the same stage and technique.
It is hard to say what movement could be slain about this discontent, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become a four-dose and more batch.
It will certainly not be a left-wing or central movement, you can bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become multi-dose, because it is obvious that we will have to revaccinated every six months.
I'm very happy the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists, to whom humanity is rightly proud.
End of heel, Bulgaria has a new prime minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked with forming a new government by Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We continue to change, which won the November election.
This has already succeeded in forming a government of a broad coalition, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost the election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties preaching the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not be reached, so that two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
From the "secret" footage taken is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, there were growing concerns about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been searching for London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she drove home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
In addition to the police, her current employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived is calling for information about the child hospital worker.
“Petra’s disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her,” Lucy O’Connor of the Lambeth police department where Srcen worked said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her work at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell district.
The last time she was reportedly spotted on a bus was about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her collaborators.
According to British media, Src was a “sisters of nurses assistant” at the Evelina London Children’s Hospital, which belongs to the Guy’s and St Thomas hospital.
“We have enormous concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the report continued.
Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councillor) reported anonymity that she violates copyright with his paintings.
But the court acknowledged that the paintings of the Mole in the rooms of Šumperk do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road was cleared in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was about life.
The municipality referred complaints to the ŘSD, to which the road belongs, and because it did not respond, the hole went on.
In the end, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RMD began to deal with the “situation intensively”.
