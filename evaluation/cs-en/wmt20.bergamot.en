Unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in Olga Špátová’s feature documentary film
This unique film from Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas in the spring of next year.
"In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me, and I was asked if, after ten years, I would again make a documentary about his life with Karel. I didn't hesitate for a minute! Filming with a man who has endured more than half a century on the limelight of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immense diligence was and is a great honor for me. I have accepted the call for a feature-length documentary about Karel Gott, which brings joy to three generations of listeners, as a commitment to this legendary singer,” says Olga Špátová.
The first day of filming was made by 22. October last year and the last footage with Karel Gott were shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself to his supporters, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has devoted joy to several generations not only in our country but also in Europe, and indeed all over the world. A man who has written himself into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not meant to be a showcase of the undisputed glory of Karel Gott and his achievements. "Therefore, it is not even possible to compare my previous film The Little Bitch Phenomenon with this present one. Everyone is different. At least by filming them at another stage of Karel Gott in another life stage, and this is very evident in his personal, even intimate confession, which he has given us and which has confirmed all of us in what legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time that is truly indescritical,” adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in the Czech Republic and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at a cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to the honest openness of Karel Gott, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
“Olga has a great gift to film with her narrow team so that we often let ourselves be carried away by a spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about the topics of relatively intimate. With her husband, cinematographer Jan Malíř, they actually became part of our family. Originally, we wanted to introduce the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life anniversary. But because I had a beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. Well, since there were a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was to be released in the spring of next year. This documentary film is a thank you to my supporters and everyone who supported and accompanied me during my profession," says Karel Gott himself.
Insects are up to sixty times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is represented in nature more than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are more reports that the insect kingdom is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on this topic was published this week and the situation is even more serious than humanity has been aware of so far.
The study is based on field research in the tropical forest in Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write at the beginning of the report, insects are "ten to sixty times less" in the forest today. It is a loss of the entire population, i.e. not the number of species, with researching not only in the insect, but of all artisanal. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of another fauna, which is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is thinning.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius in the last thirty years, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the author's team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously anticipated.
A large article on the Washington Post was published on Monday, which reports new findings as hyperalarming in the headline. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, whose newspaper quotes as an independent expert, told the newspaper.
Insect extinctions also apply to Europe. "In our country, the decline is also of the order," points out Lukáš Čížek of the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. In addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account the changes in the landscape that play an essential role in Europe. "In our country, it just runs significantly longer than on Puerto Rico," Čížek adds explained why scientists could have measured such a rapid decline in the forest compared to the 70's.
Czechs in Europe by Ondřej Houska: Was Czechoslovakia supposed to reject the Munich Agreement in 1938 and go to war with Germany? NOT three times NOT
The unsubscribed film depicts Adolf Hitler during a visit to the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the fortresses was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies are involved.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would exclude the most Czechoslovak soldiers from the fight? German tanks, air force, or artillery? Quite possibly it would not be one of these weapons, even though the Germans had overwhelming predominance over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the greatest losses - due to blisters.
Police union president Stepanek resigns, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Police Trade Union, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave office. This was stated on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Stepanek has led the union since 2005. He will be president of the union for another two months. He will remain in the police force even after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that this week I have handed over to the Bureau my written resignation, after which I will perform the fullest for two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I have decided as a free man who does not want to be attaching the union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said of the departure.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the Association participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for security forces. He also got into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior Radek John in 2011 and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the governing coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Semily Museum returns to the Velvet Revolution with exhibition
Immitation of the standardization room with TV, which runs footage of the brutal intervention of police officers against students from November 17, 1989 in Prague. This is also at the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said the curator of the exhibition, Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere with the fact that in Semily there was the first demonstration on November 22, and then more people were gradually packed every day," he said. Among the most active at the beginning was a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the immediate vicinity to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečeks, who expanded the petition Several Sentences. According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was also created quite quickly. "One specific thing is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," the curator said.
Visitors should be drawn to about 50 photographs of visitors at the time, and the pictures were taken by Karel Bárta 30 years ago. A video of the general strike on November 27, 1989, shot by František Tomíček, which will be played in the loop throughout the exhibition, has also been preserved. Ivan Hlas also spoke at the demonstration and sang at the demonstration. The Semily archive also lent a number of preserved banners to the exhibition. "What was on them was: Let's not get drunk with a roll, From the trough to the trough, We don't want violence," Chvátal said. Some changes in the city were very rapid at the time, for example, already in December people in the Vše Semily vote decided that the square would be Riegrovo and abolished the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures events before the events of November. "In the first part, we present to the witnesses and the students what was before, such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether it is banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plate from the then museum of the workers' movement," Chvátal said. One room is supposed to make you feel about what it could have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household.
The last part of the exhibition is devoted to what was after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with polling posters. Those who have experienced it will remember the posters With us to Europe or Václav Klaus is still there under the auspices of OF with a beautiful motto Everyone for his own community," the curator added.
Let the fans be positive, Hašek wishes. Sparta awaits a strea in Pilsen
"We will play at the limit of possibilities, we will do everything we can to succeed. To handle the match in a game and result," Spartan Martin Hašek promised in an interview for club television.
In the week, the goal was decided by the cup duel in Jihlava (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for her. She was relieved, but she continues to worry about the game.
Although the season is slowly spilling over into the second third, football Sparta is still looking for a face, which at the beginning of his involvement was discussed by coach Václav Jílek.
"But it's still Sparta that has very good players. We have a difficult match ahead of us," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans last arrived in Štruncovy sady, in mid-May it was an unequivocal affair in the superstructure. The guests left after a mindless performance with a 0:4 beating, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While the difference between the clubs in the table was eight-pointer before the match, Sparta has now lost nine points after ten games played in the new season. He's experiencing one of the worst entries into the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation for either us or for fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different from the moment," Hašek feels. "But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if he will be able to use Tetteh in Pilsen, who received a two-match penalty for the exclusion in Pilsen, but on Friday he appealed against him.
Costa, Dočekal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec remain on numerous mortuaries, who is the only one of the squad to remember the last Spartan victory in Pilsen from 2011.
Only the midfielder Čermák should miss the home team, who, including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, have only the midfielder Čermák. And as a captain, they should be led into the match by defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan offspring.

"A terrifying result of the study." Islam doesn't belong in the West, thinks the vast majority of Austrians
1200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Nearly 60 percent of Austria's population fears that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would demand a ban on mosque construction. For greater monitoring of the centers of Islam, 80 percent of respondents are surveyed.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, and they say that because of the presence of Muslims, they sometimes feel like foreigners in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency to ethnocentrism could lead over time to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a risk that religious freedoms, granted to Muslims, will become narrower.”
In the case of believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer claims that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. According to the sociologist, dialogue and education could help numb polarization.
According to the study, the most hostile attitude towards Muslims is the voters of the extreme right, people without higher education or seniors over the age of 75. On the contrary, the most friendly are the voters of the Greens, people under the age of 30 and undergraduate.
According to estimates by the Austrian Interior Ministry, approximately 700 thousand Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of about 8.7 million inhabitants. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer halls and mosques in the country, and Islam is officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
Thomas Cook: The Czechs were kicked out of the hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees were not enough
The Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group also filed for insolvency in the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently under discussion, it should be decided by the end of September.
According to Jan Pope, vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, three variants of possible solutions are in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will sell, or a team from the Czech branch will establish a new travel agency. "What of them it will be, but it is not possible to predict, it will depend on the German owner," he told the Czech News Agency today.
In addition to two prematurely completed tours, CK also solves cases where clients had to pay for their stay, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. CK has promised to pay its clients payments, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient security.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the pope described one of the cases where the hotel dumped all tourists offices. "The hotelier could not determine who belongs under German and who under Czech society. He therefore threw everyone out of the hotel even though the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its revenues to CZK 995 million last year, almost 21 percent more year-on-year, according to the company’s annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. The company’s net profit, on the other hand, decreased by about seven million to 15.3 million crowns. From previous years, however, the company remained an unpaid loss of almost CZK 103 million. The branch includes two basic divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, it is the Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Trump Considers Cancelling U.S. Share Registration
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering abolishing Chinese firms' business trading permits in the U.S. stock markets. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalate of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Shares of the companies in question on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the report, pulling the entire market with them.
Withdrawal of stocks would be part of a broader effort to cureb U.S. investment in China, the source added. He confirmed the Bloomberg report, which shortly before caused a shock in the financial markets. Shares of Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduouo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost from two to four percent.
According to government data from February, shares of 156 Chinese firms are trading on the U.S. Nasdaq and NYSE stocks. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises.
Bloomberg reported that an exact mechanism has not yet been developed to secure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. The plan would have to be approved by Trump, who gave the deal on the matter the green light.
China and the U.S. have been waging a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has a negative impact on the world economy and raises concerns about the recession of the global economy. With customs duties, Washington is trying to get Beijing to change trade practices and reduce China’s surplus in trade with the US.
According to CNBC, U.S.-China trade talks are expected to resume 10. October. His goal is to end the trade war.
Police accuse CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác over promotion contracts
Police have charged the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism Aleš Pangrác for contracts for promotion. Pangrák confirmed to SeznamReports that he took the allegations this week. Czech Television (ČT) said last year that police officers were investigating contracts worth CZK 38 million in the case. Some of the money, according to police, returned to Pangrác, the server reports. In the case, criminologists were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development Klára Dostálová (for ANO), whose resort CzechTourism belongs to. Investigations in the case continue, according to the server.
Detectives from the National Center against Organised Crime provided evidence in the case in the second half of last November. For example, they were at the headquarters of the Ministry for Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the Autodrom in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The company computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. In the injunction of the search near Dostálová, which was previously quoted by the Czech Television, it stated that the minister decided in 2016, when she was a deputy, on the expenditure of CzechTourism in favour of the chosen persons in a mediately and outside the standard official procedure. At the time, Dostálová said that she felt absolutely innocent, did not erricize, she can document everything and cooperate fully with the police.
According to the agency, it was an individual's misconduct. The media has previously stated that he is the former director of the Regional Partnership Department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was recalled for the results of the audit. This showed that CzechTourism had concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, they accused me. But I don't want to comment on it any more," Pangrác of the north told Seznam Zprávy.

Hundreds of enslaved children freed from religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were almost five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, said there were more than three hundred children from five years up. Some were bound to the chains, others were chained to the iron circles in the wall.
The head of the police in Kaduna, Ali Janga, told the BBC that the raid at the school was carried out on the basis of a denunciation. He described the school as a house of horror. Starvation people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was a razor wire over the walls. According to him, this is a case of slavery.
Several people were detained in the raid, according to police spokesman Jakubu Sabo, they were teachers there.
The children told the police that they were taken to school by parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most of them brought parents from Nigerian states in the north," a Sabo spokesman said. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The Imamah Chimama Chimada bin Hanbala has posed as a religious school focused on the study of Koran.
The liberated were taken to a stadium where they are given help and food. Some have already met with relatives.
The French cook is suing Michelin for removing the star. I suffer from depression, he claims
The famous French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after he acquired it. He plans to sue the publisher of the red guide to receive the exact reasons for the degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competences of Michelin inspectors, who, according to him, mistook saffron with cheddar. The first trial is scheduled to take place in November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Upper Saviour lost one of the three Michelin stars in January this year. The publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin will be sued because the commissioners’ conclusion was not properly justified. In addition, the asterisk was removed without any notice. “I have been suffering from depression for six months. How dare you play with the health of chefs?" said Veyrat to the commissioners.
Michelin is said to have provided the chef with only vague reasons, such as that the chef put in a suffle cheddar, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it and the gentlemen thought it was a cheddar because it was yellow. From the beginning, I have been working with the Savoy ingredients with the Savoy ingredients," he objected to the decision of Veyrat. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are scammers who only provoke disputes for commercial reasons." The indignant Veyrat doesn't understand "how could they dare to say we put in our suffocating cheddar." "They also offended our region, my employees were crazy about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he said.
A distinctive cook, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is an opponent of a new generation of Michelin commissioners, and therefore asks to remove his restaurant from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses to do so. "If the business remains open and our inspectors choose it again, we will continue to recommend it," said Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit is evidenced by the fact that he has no meaningful charges yet and the lawyer is yet to help him formulate him. "We're sorry that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us rudely. But we will examine his comments carefully," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
Technically perfect confusion with a weak scenario. Gemini with Will Smith did not praise the criticism
The Dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith will face his younger version in the film. According to critics, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will take place in Czech cinemas 10. October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the top in his field. It kills effectively and without unnecessary questions. One day, however, he decides to hang his career on a nail. Of course, this does not please his employers, who send another killer to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, more precisely his younger clone made of DNA. Can one determined man win the fight over himself? This time literally.
A certain guarantee of quality was to be the three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee. It is his first sci-fi, but he has extensive experience with dramatic action films, as he showed, for example, in the aforementioned Tiger and the Dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. Six writers collaborated on the script. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the very successful Game of Thrones. According to the first testimonials, even this was not enough for a good movie.
“Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn’t have enough character to highlight it,” said Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.
“This unsatisfactory film is less than a summary of all the talents involved in it. Only the technological magic of the filmmakers holds the weak script and the plot together,” said Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter.
"The Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work resulted in an incredibly unundinning action film," Peter Deburge, a reviewer for Variety, said.
"A confused product made with a bizarre idea," Ella Kempová from the IndieWire website summarized the film in her review.
"It's hard to care that one man is the other's doppelt when neither behaves like a human," Nicholas Barber of The Wrap wrote.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's accounts are provided by the banks free of charge. However, the offer should be considered, because some other services for accounts are already charged. “The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children whose basic management is free is straightforward. Financial houses are counting on the waived fees to return to them once. With the small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not mistaken,” says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
"Small accounts" know almost everything that adult accounts do. The child gets his own credit card, can enter payments, track movements in the account, somewhere he has his own electronic banking. Banks will set up an account, but it is up to the parents to teach them how to treat them and also to check them.
"Quite flexibly, the parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services and the like. Above all, however, it can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by looking over the Internet or thanks to an information SMS. Attention, they may no longer be free," Kuncová adds, adding: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, he should consider his abilities and options."
Strict but fair, we enjoy the clock! This is how the Benešov grammar school students see their favorite cantor of the writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, Pavel Hoza is convinced. The high school teacher of Czech and history is also a poet, prose writer and awakener of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind the texts of Pavel Hoza. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish country buildings, trembling grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have been after them for centuries. Grieving, slitting, blessing. This Reynek’s contemporary successor teaches Czech, literature and history at the grammar school in Benešov, the local Café for a word, he performs the equivalent of the Prague Viola and annually organizes the Benešovský literary festival.
Wife swap: Ondra's parents cruelly abused! Ended up in the institution
It was nerves. Supposedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father at any moment. "She came home from school and lied to a snack. Luke looked at me and said he would kneel as a punishment," Lucie described in Exchange. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! Outside the cameras, he said, he had to suffer like this on a wooden pad for foot massage! "Andrew came to me after filming and told me - Aunt, I'm doing the troubles and notes just so I wouldn't be here because I want to go to the institution," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was happening behind the studio door. And the boys' wishes finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken from the family after filming and placed in the Centre of Educational Care in České Budějovice for a month. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) briefly, but then he traveled to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I got home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we texted for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I almost didn't react to that at all. But then she texted me that the little one was in the institution, that they gave it back to them afterwards, now she's in the diagnosis. They are both unemployed," says Lucie's mother from the Pilsen region.
Of course, the lightning approached the other side, but only received a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call me later," Aneta said, hanging up the phone.
Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against a two-match penalty
Football Sparta appealed against a two-match penalty for forward Benjamin Tette, who received the player from the disciplinary committee for exclusion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
The Letná club announced this on Twitter and is now awaiting the verdict of the appeals board.
Tetteh had already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now aiming for the twenty-two-year-old Ghanaian striker to be able to play in Sunday's 11th round of the first league in Pilsen.
The situation could be repeated from last October. At that time, Olomouc appealed against the penalty for Šimon Falta, who received a distancing party from the disciplinary committee on Thursday for exclusion against Liberec.
The appeals committee did not manage to discuss the case, so it postponed the effectiveness of the sentence and Falta could start on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The Commission finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the following week and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
Disciplinary stopped Tette's activity for a foul on the famous player David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from the judge Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of the Ghanaian player on the captain of the opponent Tomáš Souček has not been proven.
The Germans elected Keller as head of the football association
The new chairman of the German Football Association, as expected, was the current head of the Bundesliga Freiburg, Fritz Keller. The sixty-two-year-old winemaker, gastronomist and hotelier was voted unanimously for three years, he did not have an anti-candidate.
In office, Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April due to an affair with unacknowledged income. His next predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go on trial for possible bribery in the allocation of the 2006 World Championships.
Keller said that one of the main goals would be to return confidence to the union and take it out of the crisis. "It's not going to be a One Man Show, many people will take responsibility. The union is better than his reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the slogan: Together we can do it.
After being elected to head the union, Keller left his position in Freiburg.
In the underground of the ČSA mine in Karviná was burning, no one was injured
In the underground of the ČSA Mine in Karviná this morning burned. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, a spokesman for the mining company Ivo Čelechovský told the Czech News Agency.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in a lane at a depth of about 1200 meters. "No one of the employees was hurt, no one was injured. Banan rescuers intervened at the scene immediately, who extinguished the fire directly and carried out an examination of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and disabled," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by special commissions.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná district, coal is already mined only in the Karviná district, in the mines of ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-North and ČSM-South. In the Lazy Mine, mining should end this year, the gradual downturn awaits the other mines. The mining company OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, its production last year was 4.62 million tons. There are 9000 people working in the mines.
Berlin is responding to public pressure and is addressing the housing crisis. Buy 6000 apartments from a private company
Berlin will buy 6000 former social housings sold by the city 15 years ago from the private Luxembourg firm ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros. It is responding to public pressure that is revolting against skyrocketing rent prices. According to Berlin senator Katrin Lumpscher for the Left (Die Linke) party, it is the largest ever buyout in the history of the capital of Germany. The opposition criticizes the move.
"The intention is to keep the rents stable in Berlin and give the tenants certainty," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat rent freezes," he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take up thousands of apartments located in the districts of Spandau and Reinickendorf in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city has bought too expensively. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that he said it had overpaid the housing unit by about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition Liberal Party (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation. The FDP said it on Twitter on Friday. The move was called the Alternative for Germany (AfD) protest party.
Already in mid-July, Gewobag acquired 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The award was not disclosed by the council at the time. The dispute over apartments on the former exhibition street from the times of the NDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It has become a symbol of the plight of tenants in major German cities, the paper wrote.
The German capital used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, she has gained attractiveness. Rent prices have doubled over the past decade, and some residents are finding it difficult to find affordable housing.
Nokia is suing the Brno company for the name of Lokia. People don't confuse us, the Moravians believe
Nokia has filed objections to the application of the Lokia brand to the Industrial Property Office. According to CCV, however, the substitution of products is not likely.
A company in Brno developing CCV software is facing legal action from Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. The Finns do not like the fact that the program of the Brno warehouse management company is called Lokia WMS, the daily E15 reported. Nokia has therefore objected to the application of the Logbook of the Industrial Property Office. The CCV believes that confusion is unlikely.
Marketing director Petr Ondrášek said that the program has been used by two dozen customers, he has been on the market since last September.
“The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone tries to register a grade that we believe can lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said in a statement.
The Brno developers say that they did not think of a brand famous in the past by mobile phones when creating a warehouse program. The designation Lokia according to CCV is based on the Latin name for one type of dragonfly, the rapid movement of which is to be analogous to the movement of warehouse workers.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software that companies equip their warehouse operations with, and we are not really aiming for mobile phone production. And we do not want a comparison to the brand, which may be missing a train in his field," said Tomáš Kormaňák, the CCV manager at E15.
CCV applied for the brand protection in August before the launch of the program with the Industrial Property Office. "The protection was requested for products and services belonging to Classes 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to Class 9, related services of business management in the warehouse belong to class 35 and the development of computer software to class 42 according to the international classification," Ondrášek said.
The Nokia objection is based on the fact that the older Nokia trade mark is valid in all classes of goods and services, thus extending to the widest possible range of goods and services, and therefore, of course, it also covers 9, 35 and 42. "The CCV does not dispute the claim of the object in terms of compliance with these classes of products and services. In reality, however, these are completely different brands focused on other target groups," Ondrášek said.
According to E15, the dispute over the brand can take months and the company may complicate the company’s activities.
From Sydney to London in four hours? Possible reality in 2030
Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with rocket. It is designed to drive the plane at twice the speed of the Concordes flying. "When the Sabre engine is put into service, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," Turnock said in a statement. And, for example, the distance between London and New York would be able to travel the plane in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, which exceed the speed of sound fivefold, are complicated due to engine overheating. But this problem should be dealt with by using super-Cold Helium, which should prevent temperature from rising.
“The most important thing about Sabe is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and an aircraft engine that is powered by an exhaust gas flow generated from the air,” said Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "The missiles have not undergone such a big development in the last 70 years, while the aircraft do. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and basically create a spacecraft," he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin in the middle of next year. Commercial flights around 2030.
Kovosvit sells an office building and other halls. Expects worse times
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million, the consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. The main problems of last year include the Kuchař lack of workers and shifts of subcontractors. This year, demand for machine tools fell by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected decline in turnover by an order of ten percent," the CEO said. In 2017, Kovosvit had revenues of CZK 1.3 billion and a post-tax profit of CZK 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land, which it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to an administrative building, where out of five floors it uses two, and not yet completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit, streamline its activities. The sale of assets is not part of a current solution, for example, cash-flow, but part of a long-term plan, when we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.
About half of the production is exported by Kovosvit. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, to a lesser extent Asia last year. This year, Kuchař ranks among the most interesting India, where Kovosvit won a contract for machines enabling five-axis machining worth CZK 100 million. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines for 30 million crowns to China. "Another contract in the same volume, which we would like to fulfill before the end of the year," Kuchař said. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit is facing restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that is a subcontractor of Airbus. In May this year, she delivered another machine, one more deliver at the end of the year or early 2020.
The main company investment this year was the transition of heating from steam to hot water for 20 million crowns. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average working wage is 28 500 crowns. The company is looking for casting cutters for foundry, machinists, lacers and electricians.
The company has been owned since September 2016 by industrialist and armorer Jaroslav Strnad. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. In 1939 it was founded by Tomáš Bat'a. The company had up to three thousand employees at the time.
Milan Jakubů: The funeral was stolen by the army for itself! Says Andor Šándor
There is still confusion surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated in the week that the army had planned the last farewell to the deputy director of the Military Intelligence, despite the wishes of the bombastic family, as only the soldiers can. There were also inconsistencies regarding the date of the funeral. Jan Pejšek, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with our family from the beginning, the agreed Friday term of the funeral is in place from the beginning, no one has changed it. Just as they pay military honors. We will only deal with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will eventually take place on Friday and will not lack all military honors, including the overflight of the fighters.
Around the last farewell to the popular general, however, there is a tense atmosphere. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by the decision of the organizers by the people who have worked with the general in the past!
For example, the former head of military intelligence Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Shandor remembers his former colleague as a hardworking, intelligent and "good guy."
In addition, he has been regularly meeting with him in recent years at the anniversary celebrations of the founding of Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I personally would go to the funeral of Milan Jakubů," Šándor told Bleska. But he can't.
"I also know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky, because the potentates usurp the funeral for themselves. I think that privatizing the funeral in this way is not right," the security expert said. He is not even playing the allegedly considered closure of the ceremony for the public due to the secrecy of the army leaders.
"The leadership of the army is not classified, and neither is the leaders of the military intelligence, because they are promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media information is true and the family has actually allowed itself to be irrelevated by the army, it is, of course, a matter for the family. Personally, I would never allow the army to overpower the family and its wishes," Šándor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday near Špindlerův Mlýn in a car accident. The head-on collision of Milan's Rapid with the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer in the corner should have entered the opposite direction, Milan Jakubů apparently did not have a chance to prevent the clash. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences for the rest of his life. Police questioned the ecline of the accident on Thursday.
Commentary by Jan Šindelář: To manage the railways as a company
The heavenly election, though apparently not quite smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the state's inability to give the dearers a clear direction. The board has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday evening, this does not change, because one of the members resigned. The Provisional Period lasts.
From the very beginning, the selection procedure itself was a farce because the requirements for candidates, especially in the field of practice, were significantly mitigated. Compared to the selection last year, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was supposed to operate in the past were reduced. First the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprla.
Nebeský probably presented the weakest professional CV of five finalists, yet without experience from a large company he shot experienced fighters from the management of logistical giants and transport companies. The participation of interesting managers from the private sector was probably the brightest side (and the best hope) of the whole process. Today, those concerned know that they have only played the role of epic backdrops in the political game.
Perhaps Heavenly will surprise, show great talent, and eventually turn out to be the best boss of the orbits of all time. At least in the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of the political newsagent. Czech Railways does not expect a light period, they have to cope with the competition in the liberalization of the market and with a shortage of employees in operation. There is a lack of drivers, shifters and mechanics. How should they have to motivate for further work and respect for management when the state behaves in top management like an elephant in porcelain?
The second important group is creditors. As the games at the head of the tracks will be revealed next year in the spring, when the tracks defend the rating. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. Sadly, someone else goes to Moody's on behalf of Czech Railways to defend their rating every year. The agency did not miss the frequent changes in the management of the railways and political influence on the company, criticizing them already this summer.
The ANO movement is leading, among other things, the slogan that the state needs to be managed as a company. For starters, it would be enough if one big state-owned company was run as a company, and not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if they were led by the best ones. They proclaimed themselves, but the state despised them. It can be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive the jokes with the selection process.
The pair wrapped the bitch with tape and drowned in the river, the sack was found by the children
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouky. A twenty-seven-year-old woman brought home a donated dog to one to two years old, which she wanted to take care of. Her ten-year-old partner, however, did not like the fact that she was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal with adhesive tape and rope and greatly eliminated his vocal expression. He put the dog in a jute bag that he had bound. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a bag. At the moment when the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive," police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková said.
The following day, children who played by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. So they called out to the woman walking by and ran away. The woman reported the incident on the emergency number of police force 158.
"Police officers, thanks to knowledge of the residents of the town, have found out who is probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they weren't wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the incident took place," a police spokeswoman added.
A professional statement from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died unequivocally in a tormented way as a result of suffocation, when the animal suffered from death in a matter of minutes.
"The conduct of the perpetrators undoubtedly shows the clear intention of the animal at all costs to get rid of the animal in this deplorable way, even if they could have donated or sold the dog. The commissioner of the criminal police of Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both previously unpunished charges could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková said.
Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen will be released posthumously the last album
Thank you for dancing (Thank you for the Dance) will contain unreleased material and various musical collaborations that the singer's son put together. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish the songs. On an intimate recording, Cohen symbolically copes with the imminent death. He died a month after the release of the album at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials left by his father. He invited a number of musicians to collaborate - randomly Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mase or singer Beck.
"When we invented music for his father's words, we used his own characteristic musical procedures. So he's still with us," Adam Cohen said. "What impresses me the most is the reactions of those who have already heard him. One by one, they say Leonard is still alive," he added.
The first swallow of the album is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his signature honey voice. He sang about death, knowing that the release of the new material would not be released. He also admitted this in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it doesn't get too uncomfortable," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published a collection of poetry of his father called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the title Flame on 31 December by Argo publishing house.
The first miss Christ finally went into herself: She lost a few pounds and immediately saw through
The first modern miss from 1989, Ivana Christová (49), had overweight problems for many years, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly mental problems. She suffered because she had changed a lot since the time of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it looks like she took the rebukes to heart and with excess pounds went into battle. Even if it's a long run.
It used to be a first-class beauty that conquered Paris. But it has been thirty years since then, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty pageant. Not only because of fame, but also because of how skinny she was.
Over time, she decided not to submit to the strict modeling rules that ordered her to be as slim as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in what she was in for.
But from hunger strikes she went overeating, which immediately affected her figure. In addition, the pounds tried to disguise various loose clothes, which, however, added to the size of the loose shapes.
Now it looks like Ivana really went into herself. She visibly lost weight, began to dress tastefully and appropriately to her fuller figure.
She surprised all those present at the christening of the book by Miloš Zapletal (75) for seeing through again and already has back the features of the charming brunette, who in 1989 entered history not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory provoked.
Christová will forever be the first winner of beauty, but also the very first spectators at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava whistling as the senses of getting rid of when she put on a crown.
"Parody of Justice." Scientist warns of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish base
Sik, along with other scientists, was involved in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. Its conclusion was that pollution of water, soil and food in some industrial areas in the west of the country is related to an increased incidence of cancer in local population.
The scientists mentioned mainly the industrial zone of Dilovasi, which lies about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metallurgical plants are based. People living in the area, according to them, suffer from cancer much more often than the international average.
Erdogan takes revenge for coup, international criticism despite
Sikovi seemed to think that the government, despite the clear conclusions of the study, was not taking any measures on the matter. He wrote several articles about the research in the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet. Authorities subsequently began prosecuting him for divulging classified information.
"The study has clearly shown the extent to which water resources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict was handed down. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies directly related to public health may be concealed. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
“Turkey authorities would have this important issue of public health to investigate, instead of chaposing people blazing the alarm, instead of pursuing the courts,” said Andrew Gardner of the Turkish branch of AI.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of not imposing environmental regulations in certain regions.
After the 2016 thwarted coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime began a sweeping wave of arrests. Nearly 80 000 people are now behind bars, including a number of employees of the Cumhuriyet newspaper. Authorities also put them outside the service or completely laid off 150 000 civil servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute its opponents. However, the authorities argue that these are measures necessary to ensure national security.
The fastest man on the planet missed tests. I don't take anything, he defends himself
The traditionally highly watched battle for the fastest man on the planet will be at the World Championships on the defending silver medalist Christian Coleman. The twenty-three-year-old American is the leader of the world tables in a time of 9.81 seconds and lost only once this year. His start at the peak of the season, however, was threatened due to cases with missed doping tests.
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without allegations for formal grounds. Coleman did not take three doping exams last year and this year, but not within 12 months. His first offense was due to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) back to April 1, 2018, i.e. to the beginning of the second quarter, but the test itself omitted up to 6. June. And since the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit wrongdoing in the form of three unexecuted checks within 12 months.
Coleman argued that he had only forgotten to update the data in the app about the athletes' whereabouts. "I don't take drugs or take anything legal. Many athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's all about," he said before the start of the World Championship.
He suffered the only defeat from six starts this year at the hundred-strike right away on the start of the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was surpassed by compatriot Noah Lyles by only six thousandths of a second. He used Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but only two hundred will run at the World Championships.
On paper, the second fastest racer with a performance of 9.86 is the twenty-two-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has only succeeded in American university competitions.
The title will be defended by the thirty-seven-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a time of 9.87 in Stanford in June. The last hundred in Zagreb, however, ran only for 10.29, because he slightly injured his posterior thigh muscle.
The favorites also include South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic medalist from Rio Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican is Yohan Blake, with a time of 9.96.
The man's hundred will begin on Friday round and run-ups. The semi-finals and finals are on the agenda on Saturday. The medals will run at 21:15 CEST.
The plane crash near Zhinkov in the Pilsen region: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people, a man (†63) and a woman (†38) were on the plane. "The plane at half past nine in the evening asked for permission to land at Chaloupky u Klatovy airport," police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said. This was also the last record, at which time, according to GPS coordinates, it was supposed to be located near Vojovice near Zhinkov.
The Klatovy airport did not arrive. The lost plane, which sent an emergency signal, immediately began to be searched. "In addition to the police and the military helicopter, he was involved," police spokeswoman Martina Korandová said. But the happiful end of the search did not have.
In the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from where the plane last reported, the debris of the helicopter noticed the wreckage before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korandova confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of trees, the pieces also hit the ground in the vicinity. "We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and staff of the Institute for the Professional Investigation of the Causes of Air Accidents," Korandová added.
Civilization in the lent time
Recently I remembered the beautiful "monster" from one of the great stories of Šimka with Grossmann, who set partly in the cemetery, which reads this way: "I warned her that she is crying well, but on a foreign grave!" It occurred to me that many world politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now acting very similarly.
They act as if humans rule on planet Earth. In fact, we are just a speck on her surface, which she can blow out with her giant powers like a sharp whiff of the wind flame of a candle. Few of them look at the famous British and American science documents dealing with the destructive abilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for some of the larger active volcanoes to "scuff" properly, and our advanced civilization will be deceiving itself.
And that this will happen in the near future is highly probable. A number of large volcanoes, in the opinion of leading volcanologists, have "charged and unsaved" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it had to happen, would happen as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are completely unnecessarily thrown away for measures aimed at reducing carbon dioxide production, because any really angry volcano can release it into the air at least a hundred times more than was saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
Violently limiting CO2 production makes no sense. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that at its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, possible warming is much more favorable than, for example, the rapid return of the ice age.
If we are aware of the still under-explored influence of solar cycles on the Earth’s climate, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us strive to keep the Earth as pure as possible and to other changes that we cannot compare with force, let us try to adapt with the least possible cost!
Repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be a year late
The Krkonoše National Park Administration (KRNAP) has postponed the deadline for submitting bids to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original date of opening the envelopes was September 20, said national park spokesman Radek Drahný. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting the bids is the reduction of the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
“We are currently working with the prices on the market. There has been a change in the budget, it is a price that we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that will be acceptable, the work will start as soon as possible," Drahný said.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the repair of the museum is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor for the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park administration, the European subsidy is not threatened by the project.
The KRNAP administration is not able to choose a construction company for the repair of the museum. It announced the second competition this summer, because in the previous tender all the offers of companies significantly exceeded the expected price of 65 million at the time. The bids exceeded 100 million crowns.
The museum, which is located in the former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of the new exhibition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. The now-eviated building should be established by the end of 2021 after the conversion of the exhibitions to the visitor center KRNAP.
The repaired museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people seated in the mountains and build on the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative gateway for the Giant Mountains. The visitor centre should provide the most comprehensible form of information about the past and present of the Krkonoše Mountains and motivate people to discover the mountains and protect them. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The center will also offer opportunities for concerts, festivals, theatre performances or open-air lectures. Plans include building a new entrance to the building, creating a research room or a café.
Toyota still believes hydrogen, preparing the second generation of Mirai
The Toyota Mirai should never have been a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that although there was virtually no hydrogen pumping infrastructure in the world, it still put it in the offer. So not to the completely standard, the customer really had to go after this car in a purpose, but no one else offered such a variant at that time.
Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamad confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and are in price for hybrids within ten years. Of course, this is linked to the development of gas networks. The future is as much as electricity.
The conference was often used to be used hydrogen with the needs of ecological traffic not cars, but on the contrary large tractors, boats, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to overcome on one tank long distance. Purely battery versions cannot offer that. Thanks to its great experience and long development, Toyota could find new outlets.
It remains to be remembered that, like Toyota, Hyundai, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover, believes in hydrogen power.
Stray, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: It's not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on the wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if in the green, then you are among the types warm. When choosing a new red lipstick, first of all, put on the basis of the undertone. It is only in the next one that you can take into account the texture.
If you belong to women with a cold undertone, then lipsticks in purple, plum, cherry or mauve color are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertone, choose lipsticks. You know them by the fact that they gravity towards orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
It may happen to you that some of the veins look green and others blue. In this case, congratulations - you do not have to look at the undertone and you can focus only on your color preferences.
Purposeful rumors? The Usti Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
Last the end of this month. The city leadership attributes this to the rumors that swarmed around the former director of the zoo and at the same time the veterinarian Václav Poživil, that he purposefully killed exotic animals, which he cared for. For example, it was a female rhinoceros Zamba, an elephant of Kalu or orangutan Nyuňák.
The City Council has therefore announced a new contract. "Verve veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of the supply of 3.5 million crowns excluding VAT and for the city Center for Animals in Need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns without VAT," said Romana Macová, city spokeswoman.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that the city is thus announcing a competition for veterinary services for the third time. "Dr. Poživil had to explain the unsubstantiated suspicions. I consider it an outright dishonorable dishonor of such a quality expert," she noted.
Experts specializing in exotic animals are very few. "It's definitely not a pleasant thing. The zoo is currently providing veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and a contract cost the same money. "However, the garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of financing," zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská explained.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which the Usti cheetah Jane was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as the director of the zoo between 2009 and 2012. He did not comment on the anonymity of the slander. Yesterday he did not accept phone calls or respond to text messages.
As far as the contract for the zoo is concerned, some veterinarians think that in zero interest in it is not necessarily there to worry about similar purposeful allegations, as in his case, but simply a little information. For example, the veterinarian Jiří Král has not heard of her before. "I'm hearing this from you for the first time. No one has reached out to us. Such a thing will, I think, spread quickly," he added.
The D line will be supervised by a new underground architect, brings experience from the London underground
The Prague transport company has selected an architect who will oversee the form of the metropolitan metro. From October, Anna Švarc will become her, her first task will be the appearance of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the metro cannot be viewed only as a transport construction, the underground travel should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who participated in the reconstruction of three London metro stations, won a tender announced by the Prague Public Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to it, 14 other applicants participated in the tender. "Part of the selection process was a cover letter and a CV. Apparently, my previous practice from London decided, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the local metro in the team of three people," explains the new metro architect. According to her, her practice from the Institute of Planning and Development of the Capital City. Prague.
The metro does not see it as a traffic-stop building. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have some incestry about how the metro will change, how the space will improve, I have. However, I will not know how it will really work until the next weeks, when the transport company introduces me to its ideas," says Švarc.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations aimed at maintaining the context of all stations in case they are reconstructed," the design manual explains.
Whether it is similar to the tool and the way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague Metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal, or whether it can be covered by a personality, I really don't know yet," Švarc concludes.
Former French president Chirac to bury on Monday, public piety will be on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. This is reported by the French media, citing the Chirac family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon during a commemoration in the Invalides in Paris, where the coffin with Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Elysee Palace announced.

Meanwhile, further reactions to the deaths of former mayor of Paris and the president from 1995 to 2007, which Prime Minister Édouard Philippe called "French in the true sense of the word".
Chirac was remembered, for example, by the Japanese, because the politician was known for his love for their country and the sport sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sports ones, the French press notes.
The museum of tribal art on the Quai Branla Avenue in Paris, founded by Chirac, will not collect admission for ten days in honor of the former head of state.
The opening of the Pumpkin world has delayed the maturation of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkobrodsko) - The farm in Nová Ves near Leštiny nad Leština in the Havlíčkův Brod region opened the Pumpkin World for more than a month today. Decorations made up of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated in the garden of the mighty orange pyramid. The autumn event, which becomes a tradition, begins this year a week later, as the pumpkin on the surrounding seven hectares of the Pippa family's fields matured longer. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told the Czech News Agency today.
Pipps grow many kinds of pumpkins, but the last two years they were not good at the weather. This year's harvest has been delayed and some species didn't work out. "We have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween as usual, but some kinds for the dimples didn't work," Pipková said. Nevertheless, it is possible to choose from several kinds on the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and digging decorations through hokaido cooking pumpkins or oblong "spaghetti" to ornamental goulashes of different colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers hand-dignify the plants and harvest their fruits, cutting off from the stem of the pumpkin with scissors. Pipps regularly opened the pumpkin world since 2010, last year attracted thousands of people. Decoration from pumpkins is complemented by attractions from straw or maze from logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farmhouse. It will be open daily until November 3.
Details of the event are on the farm website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, even for pumpkin muffins or juice. Other options for the treatment of pumpkins in the kitchen are told by the visitors themselves. "A lot of cookbooks have tried their recipes, we will be inspired too," Pipková said. She noted that some housekeepers also load pumpkin onto sourdough like cucumbers.
The meal voucher is planned by the ministry from 2021. Taxes nothing changes
The MoF is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which an employee would receive money for food directly. According to the MoF, a quarter of employees, i.e. about a million people who do not receive meal vouchers, will reach support.
According to David Rýce, chairman of the Association of Voucher Operators, however, a number of small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide their employees with meals, for example, by importing food or by agreement with restaurants.
"The essence of the intent is that we do not change anything about the tax advantage. Furthermore, health and social insurance will not be paid for," Schiller said on Friday. She added that the limit for the maximum employer's contribution applicable as a tax rebate would also remain.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the price of the meal voucher. The remaining part is paid by the employee, in some cases they are also paid by the employer, but without a tax discount. The best value of meal vouchers for employees and employers this year is 123 CZK.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semifinals of the World Championships
The kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semifinals of the World Water Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifier, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. Another three Czech representatives will be aiming for a semi-final start in the afternoon repair qualifying run in Spain.
Vavřinec Hradilek failed from a strong national team group of kayakers, who received a fifty-second penalty for improperly passing the goal at the beginning of the ride. On the contrary, they can already rest with Sparkler and focus on Sunday semi-finals.
"I set myself the goal of going the first ride into the thirties, which I managed to do. Not that I didn't care how I turned out, because on Sunday it starts very early in the morning, so I was hoping that I would be a little higher so that I would have a better starting position," Přindiš said, praising the well-being in Seu. “Before the patrol race, I felt the worst in 14 days we’ve been here. But then it was good during the race and today it was better. The whole time it's beautiful here, nice races, the spectators came, so fine," he smiled.
The Sparkler was also satisfied. “In qualifying, you don’t want to make an unnecessary mistake. I didn’t do it in the first wickets. Then I did well in the middle, without any problems and I knew I had a mileage, so came the second mistake when I wanted to go downstairs straight and turned the erka. Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. The form is, we'll see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised the fact that on Sunday they will go to the start at the end of the semi-final block. "I'm not an early bird, it's cold in the morning, and when you're here for the eighth, it wants to have a jacket and a sweatshirt," Přindiš said. "Overall, it takes an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," Srksevic agreed.
Of the three Czech singkanoists, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the progression twenty, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. "I went down the upper part, in the middle arid I felt like I didn't make it and I wasn't going as planned, but I was able to get into the comfortable track I wanted to go. I made two nudges and I'm just past the winner's clean time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals," Fišerová praised.
The coal will give way to gas and core. Renewables Won't Cover Increased Demand, Says ExxonMobile Chief of Europe
Renewables will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet the future demand for energy. Due to the inappropriate climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the U.S. group ExxonMobil, one of the world’s largest oil producers, said in an interview with HN. At the same time, he mentions that large storages, which could be stored for later on unused energy from days when there is enough sun and wind, are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobile Center in Prague, where 1200 people work and whose task is to support the company’s business activities and provide logistics and other services needed for the functioning of the company.
Declaration of the end of the right in the Chamber of Deputies or What "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
There have been reports in the media and commentary recently about the forthcoming coalition of the mentioned parties. Many applaud that the "right" is finally getting back together, but I'm more of a question about why these parties are still calling themselves right-wing.
Aside from the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it does not matter how the subjects themselves refer to themselves or what designations are parroted by the mainstream media. The ODS is hardly a centrist in its average of top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly a party of the city pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism, and thus hypocritically referred to itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that basically merges with its conception, ideology and voter targeting TOP 09 (I am simply not clear about the reason for its existence). And the KDU even labels themselves as a center-right for a long time - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you feel like I took everyone out of one water clean? No, I come from the real political actions of these parties. If I consider myself to be a classically liberal right-wing voter, for me the highest value is the freedom of the individual, the free market and the minimum intervention of the state in the life of individuals and the economy. How do the parties fulfil this general assumption of right-wing? How many laws cutting people’s freedoms by the sausage method, increasing taxes, confirming new regulations and growing surveillance, increasing the link to the socialist EU or supporting environmental and gender frenzy have supported in recent years? A lot, really a lot. Not their own labels, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. This has nothing to do with right-wingness.
I would not be surprised by the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, on the political map it simply belongs to each other and, apart from Christian or homosexualistic and gender aspects in them, in them, in the sense of the influence of the state on their lives, I basically do not see an obvious difference. However, the ODS has long been portrayed as "one right-wing" and by linking to these three entities, it is already openly revealing its actual political classification.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the stickers. Have you noticed how often all these parties quite identically and cheaply label the criticisms of dirigismism and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can't or just don't want to understand that there are many people who are not as strong that Eurosocialism and rising unfreedomo do not smell as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Do they not hide their complete argumentative incompetence and unjustified or blind adoration of the EU’s conditions?
It is simply possible that in the Czech Republic there is no chance of a greater success than the centre policy. Maybe voters really want this kind of bonding. Perhaps they want a left-centered politics under the guise of the "right" because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or cannot even identify it). I don't know. I am not one of those voters.
Unexplained death of a girl (†8) in the Příbram region: The culprit is not expected of punishment
Unexplained cases are called "monuters" in criminal slang. But they are also under investigation if new information emerges after years. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, the criminologist Jiří Markovič managed to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague’s Prokopské údolí region for 12 years. "The 1955 case? It's going to be hard, very hard. It would take a time to find a file, it may no longer exist, talk to those who investigated it. Hope is always, but it would be really hard," says Markovic.
Under the previous regime, the public was not very informed about violent crimes, but according to Markovic, this certainly does not mean that they were investigated laxly. "It always depended on specific people," the criminologist thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 50's of the 20th century can be destroyed, although unclosed cases should not be shredded.
Lucie White's father didn't root for her at all. You won't believe what she was supposed to do for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession of a seamstress and her real name Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glassworks!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love of singing was born when, as a young girl, she performed in a cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the foam still lives.
"And I remember where my mother was sitting. At that time, a singer was born in me," she admitted to Radio Impulse.
But her father was a little worried about his daughter's future and advised her to go down the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"Dad always said, 'Chamel girl, craft. Walk your feet on the ground!’ He even talked me into asking if I wanted to go to the local glassworks. The glassworks doesn't work anymore, I do. I am a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants from the beads, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs for money," she added with a laugh.
The launch of the new toll is not threatened, Kremlin reports. In the game is a change of operator
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport began preparations for the new tender for the operation of the new toll system. This is a backup plan that would be used by the state if the current toll treat was finally cancelled. In addition, the state is preparing another temporary solution if it does not manage to complete the tender in time. This was stated on Facebook by the Minister of Transport Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO).
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium with a one-year delay. The Ministry will file a dissolution.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not compromised. Starting today, we are launching the preparation of a new transparent procurement procedure, the subject of which will be the operation of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," the minister said.
The state would thus look for an operator in the tender, which will be launched from this December. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor about the use of the old system that Kapsch now operates.
However, according to Kremlík, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on the previous experience with the toll tender, I am deeply convinced that the Office is wrong and that in the 12-month period it is not objectively possible to prepare and implement such a complex procurement procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to the new operator," he said.
In addition to the new procurement procedure, the resort will also prepare a makeshift solution that would solve the toll collection for a temporary period until the state found a full-fledged form of solution.
The state will probably not yet use the offer submitted to it by the current administrator of the Kapsch toll in recent days. The Austrian firm offered the state the operation of the existing system in case the toll contract were to be cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that he believes that a backup plan will not be needed. The Ministry will therefore appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority.
The Office issued a decision on Thursday in which it prohibited the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will not come into force until a year after the legal force of the decision of the Office. This is not final and can be appealed against it to the President of the Office. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.
Last year’s tender for the new toll system and its operator won by the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium. It succeeded in a toll tender with an offer of CZK 10.75 billion for 10 years of operation. The current operator Kapsch, who failed with an offer of over 13 billion crowns, protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract.
I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around, says Jan Cina
"That was a big school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with an afro dance. The way I have something Romani in my dad, it completely enchanted me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
Much fresher memories than the series The First Step has on the role of a painter in the new film National Class. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have attracted him a lot. “The work was difficult, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but at the same time fun. It was filmed on Národní třída, where I drove a car as a non-driver. There was also a lot of filming in the South Town in Prague," he said of the Czech-German co-production film.
Although he is nominated for the Thalia Award for a role in the production Little Prince, he does not consider it the pinnacle of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a boy who's just getting toe. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he revealed, adding that he did not even think about the thank-you speech in the event of victory. "I don't, but as a child, when I listened to discussion shows on the radio, I always imagined how I speak to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To have each other gladly and perceive the problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the awarding of the Czech Lions, when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery boots, and the red carpet was slippery, too. So it wasn't long before he was lying on the ground. He was able to make it a priority. He had a workshop of Vančura’s Stairs, where he taught how to safely fall from the stairs at VIP events.”
Děčín Zoo rejoices in a small macaque
"Our band currently consists of seven members. Its youngest member came into the world on August 17, gave birth to a female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father is the male Hitam. The first days after giving birth, the female wore the baby firmly pressed to the body and for a long time did not want to show the world whether she gave birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of the age of the cubane, however, it has gradually begun to postpone it for a little while, and the nurses have known for a few days that it is a male," zoo spokeswoman Alena Houšková said, adding that the Děčín Zoo has successfully bred 12 chicks of this kind.
Macaks are the so-called endemic of the island of Sulawesi, that is, they do not live elsewhere in the wild in the wild. A typical feature is the black coat and the plume on the head, according to which they have a name. Macaks plump live in rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal food. In the diet, the fruits of forest trees, which are complemented by flowers and leaves, are very strongly dominated. It solves the need for protein by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and puddles.
“Aside from the natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else has been written down by man. Locals hunt macaques as a favorite prey with tasty meat and fur. Fatal for these animals, the burning and felling of the rainforest is fatal," the spokeswoman added.
Germany reports the first case of the West-Iron fever from the mosquito on its territory. It has to do with climate change
Mosquitoes, in addition to Western Nile fever, can also carry malaria.
Germany on Friday reported the first time a person infected with West Nilan fever on German territory after a pinch of an infected mosquire. This was reported by the DPA news agency. Until now, all patients have contracted the virus while traveling or contacting sick animals. According to experts, the breakthrough case of the disease is related to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said a seventy-year-old man from Saxony had contracted the virus. The disease had a serious course in him and due to inflammation of his brain was treated in a hospital in Leipzig. He's healthy now.
The West Nile fever virus was first proven in 1937 in Uganda. In the meantime, it spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in the 90's, to the United States. Its carriers are mainly birds and mosquitoes, who become infected with their infected blood.
Managers of state-owned companies are to go through the selection process. The law will be circumvented, the opposition says
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said Zbyněk Stanjura, chairman of the ODS parliamentary group.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes to prevent the opaque distribution of functions in the future - critics talk about newsagents - in state-owned companies. Newly, candidates should go through the selection procedure at the given ministry and will also be considered by the Government Committee for Personnel Nomination.
However, this is a compromise solution that ODS, for example, does not like, because it will allow ministers to make excuses that selection committees are responsible for the possible poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the said committee for the Minister will not be binding. The novelty has yet to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Přerov: Driver crashed near the village of Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight section between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old chauffeur of the fabia couldn't handle the butler and drove off the road. The car flipped onto the roof and he was trapped beneath it. He did not survive the injuries.
"According to the initial information found on the spot, a passenger vehicle driving in the direction of the Kokory off the road, where it overturned on the roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," police spokeswoman Miluše Zajícová told news server Novinky.cz.
Where are the audience? Doha can't be London
At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, as the pilgrimage to Doha was voluntarily and consciously renounced the thrilling atmosphere, reigning at a sold-out London 2017 stadium at the European Championships in Berlin last year.
Giant banners on the walls of the skyscrapers in Doha are invited to the "most sporting event of 2019". However, fears of how dignified her backdrops will be are growing.
"Tickets are sold out for all evenings," the organizers say.
But that's too little.
The upper gallery of the Chalífa stadium with a total capacity of 40 thousand spectators is already overlaid with brightly colored sails, on which the flags of 209 participating countries are also depicted. Athletics has gone in Qatar to a territory where, despite the annual Diamond League meeting, it has no roots.
So let’s not be surprised that last week only 50 thousand tickets were sold for ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari rials, i.e. less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling at least half of the uncovered parts of the stands. Therefore, according to the sources of the British newspaper Giuardian allegedly (although the organizers themselves deny this), they are handing out free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as children. Sebastian Coe, head of the athletics association (IAAF), can also comment positively on: “That’s how we can inspire next generations.”
Rich Qatar has won world handball and cycling championships in the past, and football will be the turn of football after athletics in 2022. The financial offers of oil superpowers will always be lucrative for the wealthy sports federations. This is the reality of today’s sports world.
But even if we accept it and aside from the absence of fans in the stadium, we will not resist the purely sporting sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor world championship of athletes on the Arabian Peninsula was supposed to be timed better by the IAAF leaders - and for another year. Extremely late term, forced by the climate, breaks the entire scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus preparing for the key season of the Olympic season, which would normally start athletes in October.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for this at least with technological innovations, with the help of which he promises an ultra-modern and attractive mastery. Is it just 37 degrees? Already, the area of the stadium is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built directly in the blocks, also have a detailed approach to the TV viewers of what takes place in athletes in hundredths of a second before the starter shot and just after him.
Sparta is really packed this year, acknowledges Hradec Králové bek Nedomlel
In his case, increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defenseman Richard Nedomlel will go in Friday's match against the club where he recently worked. However, the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be the same, even though they never wore the jersey of the Prague club.
"Everyone wants to pull out against Sparta," says Hradecky bek before the match of the 5th extra-league round.
Hradec Králové will try to stretch their series of wins, which currently counts three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen came on Sunday the most appreciated fans, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice.
“We can’t watch the games that were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them the same way, if not better," warns the defender of Hradec Králové.
Hradec Králové should not even look back at last year’s balance sheet with Sparta. They lost in three of the four matches, taking points only once after the victory in Prague after an extension. In addition, the Sparta management brought several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what we're going to talk about, this year they're really charged," admits Nedomel before the first match of the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and does not know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank conducts internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies. It is responding to an instruction from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank, and then the bank pays cryptocurrencies to the suppliers of the oil firm. Employees are also studying a proposal for the central bank to be able to count cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now close to the low in 30 years. This was reported by Bloomberg, citing information from four sources.
The sanctions imposed by the United States against the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This has further deepened the economic crisis in the country. The current crisis is one of the most serious in global comparison, forcing officials to use a mix of different ways to move money. While Maduro’s efforts to launch state cryptocurrency in the world failed, continued efforts to exploit digital currencies show how desperately the government is trying to find ways to circumvent restrictions.
Neither the Venezuelan central bank nor PDVSA have responded to a request for comment.
It is unclear how PDVSA came to its own bitcoins and ethers, nor how much of the value of these currencies it owns. The business has trouble getting payments from customers through conventional channels because large banks are unwilling to trade with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the $700 million payment in the Chinese yuan because the parties failed to find financial institutions that would allow the transaction.
PDVSA may not want to sell cryptocurrencies in the open market, because it would require it to register on the stock exchange and undergo an in-depth control, the so-called due diligence. Instead, she wants the central bank to use the cryptocurrency and pay with it to the entities to which the PDVSA owes it. Oil officials believe that the central bank is less exposed to possible obstacles that could arise when paying with cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized online ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are allowed without the need for an intermediary. Fewer banks are involved in digital currencies because of money laundering issues and information about the client that relates to them and complicate compliance.
After the 2018 debacle, cryptocurrencies are experiencing a return to the limelight this year thanks to the expectation of their greater acceptance by the institutions and the plan of Facebook to come up with their own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen by almost 20 percent in the last four days, but has a profit of about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Neckermann cancels all flights, it affects five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann is cancelling flights in connection with the insolvency of the British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., acting under the trade name Neckermann Travel Agency, did not file an insolvency petition," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue to cancel planned departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from 26 September to 6 October.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect about 500 clients. According to him, 800 clients of Neckermann, who are currently abroad, will "be will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic by their planned flight".
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In this case, it is necessary for the clients to contact the SOS line CK Neckermann immediately," Šrámek added.
Thomas Cook's collapse occurred on Monday. In August this year, the travel agency made an agreement on the basis of which creditors were to invest £900 million in the company.
Half of the sum was to be obtained from the Chinese firm Fosun Tourism. Based on this, it was supposed to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, on September 20, information emerged that the lenders had asked the travel agency to get a £200 million reserve, otherwise the deal was falling. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
Someone killed a non-conflict homeless woman under the bridge. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the evening until the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. This is where the police call for possible testimony relates.
"One of the drivers, who was driving along the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or along the street Pod Krejcárkem, could have filmed the killer, for example, on a dashboard camera. Maybe a witness could only see him, and he could describe him. In short, we will welcome any testimony to this case and accept it on line 158," said Jan Daněk, spokesman for the regional police directorate.
According to a spokesperson for Daněk, a homeless woman was murdered, she did not drink alcohol and did not seek out the company of other people. The woman lived at the scene. "Most often, she moved around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she had large blue shopping bags," Daněk added a description of the victim, who could also help any witnesses.
Slovaks succeed, only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association succeeded in appealing against the closure of the stadium for the racism of fans. The representation was originally supposed to play a match of the European Championship qualifier with Wales without spectators, instead the union will now only pay a fine of 15 thousand euros (about 387 thousand crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of fans during the recent mutual qualifiers in Budapest, which the visiting wards of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2:1. It closed the stadium for both associations for one match and fined Slovakia 20 thousand euros, Hungary 67 thousand euros.
After the appeal, the Slovaks were only fined 15 thousand euros for offensive political shouts. The next match of the national team in qualifying for the European Championship with Wales 10. October in Trnava will be made available to fans.
Basketball players for medal from the World Under-17 Championships did not reach, finished fourth
The third World SAB Won was also won by the American women, beating Spain in the final just 77:75 despite the 40 points of the Spaniard Angela Salvadores.
"We wanted to win very much and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the beginning, but it didn’t manage to keep it, because they overwhelmed us under the basket,” said captain Karolína Malečková. "But playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, thanks to two threes they took the lead 8:0 and dominated the whole first quarter on the pitch. At that moment, it seemed that he would repay the opponents' defeat from the basic group 85:88 after the overtime. But the referees whistled 15 fouls in half-time and with disputed decisions helped Hungary to return to the game with a 12:2 streak.
"I'm convinced it was enough to put another two or three baskets, run to 20 points and we wouldn't let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I am not interested in the referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent to catch on," coach Richard Fousek said.
“It wasn’t the first time we’ve had a shortfall in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't let anything out and they fought to the end. But the opponent was very good," he added.
The Czechs held in the game especially Petra Holešínská by accurate shooting from distance and pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the best Czech shooter had a problem with fouls and a large part of the third quarter was missing on the pitch. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they have already maintained, even though the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
“The first five games were very difficult for us, we were turning the matches in a narrow rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. It was already obvious against Spain that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take. We weren't consistent on defense because of the physique. We didn't play a quick counterattack, we missed the rebound. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don’t combine everything together, you’ll have a hard time winning,” Fousek added.
He believes his ward faces a promising future. “In two years, the girls have managed to win the Youth Olympics, be second at the European Championships of sixteen years and now they are fourth in the world. At our standards, it is a quality team with a good character and it is necessary to continue working with it and develop talent. Now he is at the federation, which the coach will assign to them in the higher categories," Fousek added.
The end of political traffic? The new law, according to critics, will not help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to make ministers get rid of responsibility for the election and continue to choose their candidates.
Greater transparency in tenders for posts in state-owned companies - this is one of the objectives of the Nomination Act. 119 Members voted in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of ANO, the KSČM, the Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection procedure before the government committee. For example, the Pirates were trying to make the recommendation for the minister binding. That didn't happen in the end.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD are concerned that the nomination bill will be recording ministers. "Newly, the minister will be able to hide behind some decision of the commission and will thus not have a clear transparent responsibility," SPD leader Tomio Okamura said. Martin Kupka, vice-chairman of the ODS, speaks the same way.
The Government Committee should completely reject candidates who will not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free, minimum age of 25 years, and the main criterion of choice should be expertise.
The bill will still have to pass through the Senate and then the president will get it to sign.
Difficulty competition for the Dam Kamiq. Kia XCeed bets on the rich equipment at what cost?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model. It clearly falls among the compact SUV, but does not offer all-wheel drive. This item is left by a larger sibling Sportage, which is as direct to the car as the Skoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, XCeed also relies on more dynamic body shapes, which by sloping the rear can remotely remind the world of SUV-couché, popular in this part of the market, especially among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, XCeed cannot be classified only on the part of plasticized versions of classic compacts, such as Ford Focus Active. Compared to him, Koreans made a lot more changes to the bodywork, so those who do not want to see Ceed in the shape of the novelty may not even see.
Unlike the compact hatchback or Ceed estate, the XCeed also offers exclusively with turbocharged engines, so don’t expect a basic atmospheric fourteen-hundred. The XCeed starts with a turbocharged liter and also offers a turbocharged 16-hundred with 150 kW, reserved for the GT siblings. Don't expect a sports degree here. Turbodiesel 1.6 CRDi is offered only in mild-hybrid design, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps with reducing consumption and emissions. From 100 kW, it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.
Soon, the offer will be expanded by a plug-in hybrid, a variant that will travel about six tens of kilometers only on electricity. The batteries can also be charged from a normal socket.
Simona Krain: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucie Bílá!
The day before the christening of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krainová posted her latest photos of her naked! “I was a little afraid that people would condemn me, that I was taking pictures naked at my age. I am a pretty shy person. But so far, I only have positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want to, it goes even at the age of 46 to have a firm figure. Of course, there's work and renunciation, but there's no other way."
"Kulak Dvorak and I took about three thousand photos, we picked about a hundred and there are twelve in the calendar, so the rest is still waiting for its moment. It’s definitely not the last time I’m naked,” the model, who also came to her baptism, told Blesk.
She had an extended Bernhardt jacket and shorts under it, but they weren't visible, so it looked like she had forgotten the bottom. Everyday running has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so happy about her success that she kissed everyone she met at the christened baptism. Husband, friends, even Slavice Lucie Bílá.
Car tuber brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, the headline of the long text written by Michael Hobbes for the Huffington Post and took a picture of Finlay Mackay. The provocative explanation then states that the medical community has for decades ignored the facts about obesity and waged a fierce (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people, which not only marked public opinion, but also destroyed a lot of lives. Now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes puts at the beginning is the fact that from knowledge and knowledge of facts to putting into practice often leads to a very long and tiring path. He mentions the case of the scurvy, when some captains had already handed out lemons, limes and oranges in the seventeenth century that they would prevent the disease. However, the British Navy has withdrawn from this practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear effect of the fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the navy to take it into account. Even the seatbelts existed long before the invention of the car, but they did not become mandatory until the 1960s, as well as the first confirmed deaths in connection with asbestos coming from 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every discovery in the field of public health - and it doesn't matter how significant it was - it has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices and financial stimulus within the society to which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society, today, almost 80 percent of the adult population and around one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans today live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson and HIV combined.
Obesity is seen as a high personal failure of an individual, which is claimed to burden health care and reduces GDP. The fear of thickness is so great in the population that Americans spend more money on diets today than they spend on computer games and movies. The truth is that diets don’t work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on the diet will then gain more than they dropped.
Armed with the statistics, Hobbes further describes the lifestyle and traumas of overweight people. Personally, here he meets the systemic, for example, at the faculties when teaching future doctors, he devotes only 19 hours of nutrition to the issue of nutrition. Which, at a time when the 60-collar process of the Americans receive comes from ultra-processed food - that is, too processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized is illustrated in turn, reports from offices where overweight people usually experience shorter check-ups, doctors approach them with less empathy and consider them more problematic patients.
But overweight is far from just the American problem, as Hobbes writes, since 1980, the share of obesity in 73 countries has doubled and rose in 113. And in that time, no country has managed to shrink and stop this increase. Absolutely none.
Brno Grand Prix? There is a risk of priced tickets
The most expensive item is the listing fee every year before the Grand Prix. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno at the Grand Prix spend money there on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less balance the costs associated with organizing the event, including the listing fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno doesn't have so many of the world's tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors from abroad. It is important for Brno as, for example, a tuřany airport or an exhibition center. And these are the projects that are supported by public money," the economist added.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the last five years: CZK 682 million
- problem: lack of money for organizing, increasing the listing fee for the promoter company Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in the price of tickets
- current status: negotiations on a new contract for the organization of races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration Filip Hrůza, the organizers now have to evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix is sucking money out of public budgets for other issues. But to a certain extent it is a political, and not an economic question," he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motorsport event can be even higher. In play, the option of increasing the listing fee is almost double.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst-case scenarios were to be fulfilled, I am afraid that it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount," admitted Brno Mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. "The condition of Dorna is that advertising must be placed in places that do not occupy the cameras. The selection of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, the company from the same area cannot be the second sponsor," Vaňková explained.
Organizers can also get more money from tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will be. And we have to adapt the revaluation of tickets to this," said the Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
D5 accident: Truck collision closed the highway
The event was reported around 08:00 on the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight transport. Passenger cars can drive across the gas station," police spokeswoman Michaela Richter said in the morning. Operations were restored around 14:30. According to Richterová, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the cause of the accident is being investigated by police.
Petr Svoboda, a spokesman for the Central Bohemian fire brigadiers, said one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other a plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles were shifted, which firefighters first had to secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Another 200 litres were discharged by firefighters. The environmental department of the Beroun town hall was called to the accident due to the fuel leak. The rescue of the crashed vehicles and the passage of the highway was ensured by a private company, which also extracted contaminated soil.
Unsuccessful qualifications. Czech athletes are not yet successful in Doha
The World Championship in Doha started with qualifying failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáková dropped out in the 800 meters and the pole vaulter Romana Maláčová and the hammerer Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place, which surprised last year in London, did not pass the qualification.
The run-up on Friday will be completed by the hurrider Vít Müller and the night marathon race will run Marcela Joglová.
Saffron threw the third attempt of 65.46 meters and fell almost six meters behind her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final, it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 cm.
Mezuliáníková, who made it to the championship at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth run on the penultimate sixth place and even a time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough for her to advance to the semifinals. She lagged behind her highs by one and a half seconds. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I fought with my opponent in the corner, which made me quite a bit of strength. I felt like I still had the strength, but that's where I'm hamved. I almost stopped and had to run again, so it was a little uncomfortable about this. I can’t be completely satisfied,” said the Czech representative.
She was glad that she overtook at least one opponent in the finish line. "She really wasn't good at it, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was the fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. The fastest half-three in the run-up was Winnie Nanyond of Uganda in 2:00.36.
Doha is missing the best eight-hundred-a-hundred-a-header of recent years, Caster Semenya of South Africa, who has too high testosterone levels in her body, but like some other runners, she rejects the treatment imposed by the IAAF rules since this year.
In the 100 meters, the role of the number one favorite was confirmed by American Christian Coleman, who was the only one to get below the 10-second mark over 9.98. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is aiming to defend his title at the age of 37, also advanced to the semifinals. The Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is the performance of 9.86 doubles of this year's tables and was expected to compete with Coleman, who has a performance of 9.81 this season.
Kubánec Juan Miguel Echevarría, who first jumped to 840 cm, showed great form in the qualification of long-distance distances Kubánec, who flew to a distance of 840 cm. No athlete in the World Cup qualifiers in the last 20 years has jumped that far. Twenty-one-year-old Kubánec leads this year's table with an output of 865 cm.
French candidate for Oskar Les Misérables to open Be2Can parades
The Golden Bear and both winners of the acting awards from this year's Berlinale, the award for directing and the jury award from Cannes and much more will present the 6th edition of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year, the Be2Can festival will also present a selection of the most remarkable and impensive ones that presented the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's show will be the French drama Les Misérables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is the French Oscar nominee. The preview of the film in Prague will be personally presented by the representatives of the two main roles of the criminal unit police officers, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zong. Alexis Manenti is also co-writer of the film.
Be2Can will take place this year in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (art cinema), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2. to 8. October.
The director's director Ladj Ly's director's director's feature debut was released at Cannes after his success at Cannes and awarded at a number of other world festivals. At the Durban IFF, he won the Best Film Award and Best Screenplay Award, as well as being shown at the Zurich IFF, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo, and will soon be released in San Sebastián.
As part of the festival, however, audiences can also look forward to the films Synonyms, Young Ahmed, System Violder, Goodbye, My Son, Pardon, We have not caught you, Ghost Town Anthologies and the film U Zlaté Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will head to the Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, the Czech triumph of the Painted Bird.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
The vote of the upper house of the Canadian Parliament has confirmed the rumor for several days: Canada is taking the honorary citizenship of the former human rights legend, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for her efforts to bring freedom into her country, has lost her honorary title over a genocide stake in the minority Rohingya nation.
The decision to take Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislative body a week ago, and senators have now unanimously supported it. "This is the right message for both her and Myanmar and for the whole world," independent Senator Ratna Omidvar commented on the decision of her colleagues. "We have to make it clear that genocide accomplices here in Canada are not welcome - all the more like honorary citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian Parliament for Suu Kyi technically changes nothing, it is only an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for it. The silence of the long-standing human rights activist to the atrocists committed by the majority Buddhist Myanmar for months on the Muslim minority of the Rohingya is unbearable.
The fact that there is an officially organized genocide in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the government - has utterly failed in the obligation to protect its citizens has recently been brought by a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders, who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that - as the report says - "shock both by the apprifiousness of their actions and a huge scale." Suu Kyi and its leadership administration, according to the UN, committed complicity primarily by the fact that the actions of the soldiers covered and omitted around them by protecting the fog of lies - for example, that it is an "anti-terrorist operation."
After the removal of Suu Kyi, five personalities remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gyamchho, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shia Muslims and Malala Yousufzai.
The Canadian Museum of Human Rights has also reflected developments around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy, where information about the atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to take the title of honorary citizen added to Suu Kyi’s profile. "We have also muted the illumination of her photo on a tabla capturing the timeline of the fight for human rights and we are thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohousing minority," museum spokesman Rorio McLeod said.
The only thing that will remain in the current tremors of Suu Kyi - at least for the time being - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to it on the proposal of Václav Havel in 1991 for a huge contribution to the fight for democracy. "Although the current holding of Ms. Suu Kyi is regrettable, her award will not be annulled," Nobel Foundation chief Lars Heikensten, the head of the Nobel Foundation, told Canada.
Microplastics have reached the human intestines, study confirms for the first time
Scientists have been confirmed for several years of suspicion. The team, led by Philippe Schwabl, a professor at the University of Vienna, published a study that proves the presence of microplastics in human stools for the first time. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, small particles of plastics ranging between 50 and 500 micrometers were found in the samples of all persons examined. None of the eight subjects were vegetarian, six of them did not shy away from sea fish, all drinking water from plastic bottles and food packed in plastic.
And it would be kind of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are produced either directly, for example, for the needs of the cosmetic industry, or are formed by the decay of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and sodas; in short, everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the human digestive system has only been officially confirmed. There were about 20 particles of microplastics per 10 grams of stools, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world’s population will have them in it.
Of course, the lay and scientific awareness suspects that this is not a good thing. But humanity still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. “This is the first ever study of its kind and has confirmed what we’ve been thinking for a long time. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we have to continue to investigate exactly what it means for human health," Schwabl says.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of poisonous chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And it is not yet known a solution other than limiting the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. This, however, will be difficult - the first task faced by governments, and the authorities will at least stop its steep increase. As far as plastic bottles are concerned, experts estimate that in three years, humanity consumes a fifth more than today. The current pace is the thrilling million bottles bought per minute. Approximately eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans every year. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and infests the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some states have already taken restrictions and other measures, Kenya, for example - under the threat of draconian punishments - banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering small bans (well-known straws), and the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics say such measures are pretty, but completely inadequate.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where is Meghan?
Diana was special in that she could catch people's hearts. In January 1997, it stirred up the fuss when it visited Africa and especially the minefield. The images on which he wears a protective suit and a shield on his face became iconic. And no one could have guessed that a few months later, the princess of human hearts would breathe for the last time in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son, Harry, scored when he went to the same place after 22 years as she did. He went to the mines disposal site in Diric, Angola, also put on a special protective suit, and looked very thoughtful. Surely he couldn't resist the memories of his beloved mother, who lost at the age of 13.
Harry had a speech at the scene, where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which is working to defuse minefields and other explosives in the countries where the war took place. "The minefields are the unhealed blows of war. By cleaning them, we can help the community to find a peace with which opportunities come," he said, also calling for the preservation and maintenance of wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopaedic center just after his famous mom, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention it on the official Instagram account: "The Duke is honoured to visit the place and the community that was so important for his mother, to get acquainted with their unsuly mission and talk to everyone she (Diana) was the impression most needed to be heard, even though the problem was not globally popular," the Sussex Royal post appeared in the Instagram post.
But the royal fans may be fruspting that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) for such a quest for the memories of Diana. Both have been a separate program against Harry since Wednesday, apparently for their protection. After all, taking the little baby to the minefield, he doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to endanger his beloved family at any cost.
Only ones. We don't have a certain reproduction, but we don't have to haunt
Some words have unfortunate connotations, even though they only communicate the state of affairs. It is the word only one. It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but does not sound neutral. "You know, an only child," he says, without anything to add. Interestingly, this feature has been borne by the "one" since time, even when terms such as demographic crisis were widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a 2.1 child per woman is required to ensure simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state is reaching this value in Europe today. At the most, it is close to France or Sweden, but the simple level of reproduction of the population is not guaranteed by European states. (Within the West, only Israel stands out with the total fertility of 3.1 children per woman.) It's a situation like it's made for alarmism. That is why it is no wonder that even the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Maláčová is falling through to him: "There are almost as many singles as families as two-time families," she said in an interview with LN. But she omitted the devil hidden in detail.
Yes, it is good to draw attention to the problem instead of downplaying or ideologizing. For example, in Germany, where the campaign for more children easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of "that's how Hitler supported it"). It is good to remind you that many couples are planning only children. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (for example, a weak expansion of work from home discourages women from other pregnancies). But through it all, let's draw your attention to one thing.
If Minister Maláčová says that "one is almost as many", there is a drop of demagoguery. The statement was on the spot twenty years ago. Recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it fell to the mendained 1.14 in 2000. But since then, it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 child per woman, which is European above average. This is not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with the alarmism can take a little bit of weight.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For a start, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - but a lot of countries have committed to this under the Paris Agreement. The Central American state, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also committed to fully switching to renewable energy by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis expected to run on electricity.
The official tourism organization says that roughly 95 percent of the energy from renewable sources already comes from, with Costa Rica operating for a total of 300 days in 2017.
Costa Rica boasts nearly thirty national parks.
The density of afforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. The rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country, are one of the main tourist draws. “Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and gives an example to other states in the region, but also around the world. Climate change is requiring urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can boast of almost thirty national parks, which is indeed a lot due to the small area of the country (51 100 square kilometers). Rain or fog forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Gentle to the planet. The Night of Scientists Begins in Prague
"I would definitely visit CTU in Prague and look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, to which there is no other time access to the public," advises Jitřenka Navratilova, the National Coordinator of the Scientists' Night.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a check-up of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would run over at CLU and watch the film Green Desert," Navratilova adds. The guided tours will also be offered by nine laboratories. The motto of this year's Scientists' Night is "friendly to the planet."
Attorney General Respondes Prosecution of Mother Who Manipulated Daughter Against Father
Attorney General Pavel Zeman disagrees with the rememeration of the mother, who has long manipulated her daughter and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of mistreating and endangering upbringing. The Regional Court acquitted her, Zeman disagrees with this. In a similar hearing, according to his appeal to the Supreme Court, one can see a crime.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more concrete definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary even in terms of directing other application practices," Zeman's appeal reads.
Last year, the District Court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty of the abuse of the entrusted person and the threat of the upbringing of the child. She and her daughter created a firm, almost symbiotic bond, even in a situation where she was to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a distinct relationship with the father. The situation marked the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She was threatened with self-harm in the event of handover to her father's care.
The court sentenced his mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court abbrew awaiseed the woman in the appeal proceedings, saying it is not a crime. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court after the Supreme Court had already ordered him to decide again.
The Regional Court found that situations where one parent manipulates the child vis-à-vis the other is not exceptional. It is dealt with in guardianship proceedings, or with the help of psychologists or social protection authorities of youth. Exceptionally, criminal law is the solution.
According to the Attorney General, however, the woman committed both abuse and endangering upbringing. “The accused acted quite purposefully when she aroused negative feelings in her daughter towards her father, and purposefully affirmed these negative emotions. Such conduct not only followed the illicit intention to limit or exclude the father’s contact with a minor, but she had to be necessarily aware that this would cause negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of minors.”
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case to the regional court once more. The appeal shows that the child is now in the care of the father.
Step Away, Schiller urged for words about Czernin opposition filth
"I consider it completely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government anywhere, much less on the floor of parliament, to use such a totalitarian statement," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir in the discussion of the draft constitutional action against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes and the draft constitutional lawsuit, with which the Senate came, the deputies threw off the table.
"I'm getting dozens of messages from people I don't know. There is not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages such as how taxpayers' money is being spent here, as empty straws are being beaten here. And I even allow myself, I don't use harsh terms, one of them quotes: It's opposition and senatorial filth," the finance minister said.
"With these terms, the Nazis often used citizens of Jewish origin and the Communists their political adversaries. It is a totalitarian rhetoric, without a shrew respect for man and opinion," wrote the minister's vice-chairman of TOP 09 Czernin, who will compete for the post of party chairman with the current first vice-chairwoman Markéta Pekarová Adamová in the autumn.
"I quoted one of the many reports I received dozens during the House meeting. Their common denominator was disgust over the constant personal dishonor, which we witness daily in domestic politics and which was also the main motive of Thursday's meeting of the Chamber of Deputies. The fact that someone refers to oneself surprises me," Schillerová told the Czech News Agency.
Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, remembrance parade accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students of the university in Ayotzinapa disappeared, despite extensive investigations, the case has not yet been clarified. Students were alleged to have been detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened after that, but according to the investigation, the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, according to the APTN news agency.
On Thursday, a memorial procession took place in the capital of Mexico, families wanting to express their frustration that they still fail to find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
But the mostly calm march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals that destroyed everything in their path. Vandals were destroying shops and hotels, not shying around or destroying monuments, setting fires in the city and taking out windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything to be apprehended, asking the public for any information that would lead to the clarification of the case.
More than 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but neither of them was convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, investigators allegedly had suspects to torture, APTN adds.
Mahulena Bočanová interrupted a year-long detox and sins again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided to Lightning that she had chopped alcohol. "Dying on vacation, I thought I'd give my old, fifty-year-old body, to breathe in. I gave myself a deadline forever. I feel so relaxed, I have a lot of energy and most importantly my psyche has improved. I haven't been feeling well mentally lately. I get up better, my head doesn’t hurt, I have more energy, I have more energy, money.”
The annual abstinence was enough and the actress found her way back to alcohol. "Sometimes I have bubbles or quality wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I'll have one drink and have fun until morning. I have a bottle of wine in my fridge for a week. I also enjoyed non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," boasted Mahulena, who still forms a couple with the Brno businessman Petr.
Bočanová also returned to the theatrical season after the holidays and will newly enter the series Office in the Rose Garden. "I'm embarrassed for the first two shows, I was really bad, I was talking over. But it's getting better," the actress smiles critically.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He is especially pleased with the calm
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) will not be afraid of any questions. In your show Call and write to the boss, he publicly expresses himself on various topics. And he is no stranger to the tabloid cases, which glosses in abruptly and wittily. Although this time he wasn't laughing.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karel got sick and said it fairly, without having to poke it somewhere in a tabloid journalist. I don’t want to comment on it, it’s a serious illness, we all appreciate Karel Gott immensely. And of course, I would like to have a successful treatment and, above all, peace of mind! The peace he needs now," Barrandov TV owner said.
"I wish the media would let him go. And she waited for the news that the Master decides to provide to the media. I don't even like the different statements about what his old angulations and various celebrities think of his health. And on behalf of our media, I can say that we will devote ourselves to his illness and his person only if he shows interest in it. I think the other media should consider a similar approach.”
Young Czechs think they know how to do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
“So it turns out that young Czechs have a little more confidence in their knowledge of finance than reality. In this case, women and respondents without graduation had a significantly larger share of bad answers," said KRUK Director Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school students or undergraduates believe their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial matters from parents (37 percent), self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in the third row from teaching at school (21 percent).
Questions about finances are especially consulted with parents by women, while information on the Internet is more likely to be sought by men. The acquisition of information about finances from parents prevails in all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Practically minimal influence is the prospectus of financial institutions, professional journals and publications.
"Again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent authority in all major areas of life, is shown. Therefore, the key level of financial literacy of parents is the key level of their knowledge and experience to their offspring," Palendalová said.
Savings and investment are preferred by 94 percent of young people.
Clearly, young people are asked whether it is better to save and buy, for example, your own house or apartment, or enjoy and spend money, without savings and own housing.
The strategy of savings and investments in long-term tangible assets is claimed by 94 percent of respondents. This is true across all age categories of young people, regardless of education attained, social status or the current amount of personal income.
The strategy of the investigation is then one hundred percent for people in a marriage with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income of more than 30 000 crowns per month want to enjoy.
The hunter injured in the fall from the seat, carried him to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before half past eight in the evening in the top parts near Čertův mlýn.
"This was a very complex and inaccessible terrain, so we dispatched five of our rescuers with proper equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we have applied for cooperation between the Emergency Medical Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. Paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found hunters in a selected location with multiple injuries. Immediately they treated it and then gently, but with difficulty transported on the so-called Austrian cart through impassable terrain.
"Transporting on the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured nation was therefore handed over to the crew of the ambulance after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaškovský, the commissioned chief of the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service and at the same time the intervening rescuer, the fellow hunter was fortunately able to describe in detail where the injured person was located.
"We found it relatively quickly. However, if he had the Záchranka app on his phone, our rescuers would surely have been with him sooner and at the same time he would know about the accident and its situation immediately dispatching line 155," commented Radan Jaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with an activated app Záchranka should be commonplace in the mountains today.
Zeman conservationist - Man Stretching Constitution calls for law enforcement
Whoever moves in a divided society and does not want to go completely crazy will welcome situations when they do not have to root only their own. When can he admit the pluses of the person he otherwise criticizes. Therefore, so that he does not feel that he is oriented only according to pre-allocated stickers. Such situations include a list of severely damaged monuments that President Zeman fences during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what's going on. And who sometimes travels through the Czech Republic, a number of devastated monuments - from the centers of historical towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farms - see with their own eyes. Everyone knows that even here he can come to the word demagoguery. That if we reproach the town hall for not caring for monuments or any horror in the zoning plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or an object privatized, the owner of which is not traceable. The head of state of local politics calls: "The section of the Heritage Act allows you to fine the owners of the objects who do not care about their property." But even if the owner is inalienable, it must be admitted that the president calls for the enforceability of the law. Which even critics of his bending of the Constitution should be recognized as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands up for a good thing like squatters, which he himself does not recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the swear words, squatters draw attention to the problem outside the current interest. For the fact that this or that building is in disarray." And let's face it, the president does the unintentionally the same thing.
If you come to the historic center of Jáchymov, you are amazed at how it is morseled - including houses with Renaissance cores. At the time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of mining silver and minting of dollars (for the Americans dollars). Why? They say because of the quick-leaning sale of homes in the 90's, officials say. But why is it that the island, seven kilometers away, the seat of the Šliks, who were rattling the Jáchymov thalers, has a nicely repaired historical core? It is good if the president draws attention to these things.
Babiš called for security cooperation in the memorial of the victims of terror
On September 27, 2019, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the memorial of the terrorist attacks of the September 11, 2001 Ground Zero in New York.
Terrorism is the main enemy that all the states of the world should fight against together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said this today in the New York City Memorial to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very moving place," the prime minister said, when accompanied by his wife, Monica, he laid a white rose with the names of Lukáš Rambousek and Czechoslovak émigré Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2750 dead, who claimed the attack of a hijacked plane on a former pair of World Trade Center (WTC) skyscrapers. The WTC towers crashed after the crash, and there is now a memorial with a name list of victims in their place.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," Babis said. The US attack on September 11, 2001, was called the reason why the UN should cooperate in a unified campaign against international terrorism. In addition to the destruction of the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed into the Defense Department building in Washington by abducted aircraft, and planned another strike on targets in Washington, apparently the White House and Congress. But the plane crashed when the passengers stood up to the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, where all the states of the world should unite and fight against international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech prime minister added.
Slovenians also beat Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championship
Slovenian volleyball players will sensationally play for the first title of European champions. With the support of almost 12 thousand storm fans in Ljubljana, they defeated the reigning two-time world champions Poles 3:1 and are the first finalists.
Anyone they will challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team was much more compact in the semi-finals than the Polish world champions. They belonged only to the beginning of the opening set and with luck the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players were overcome in defence and from the players in the red-and-white jersey basically scored only the native of Cuba León.
On the other, both smashers Chebulj and Urnaut and the second all-rounder Štern, who soon replaced the insignificant Gasparini, were presented in the home line-up. The Poles paid the price for all previous matches at this Euros winning confidently, while the Slovenians gained self-confidence after the heavy battles in the playoffs with the Bulgarians and the Russians.
The Slovenians lost to the Poles in August this year in the Olympic qualifiers in Gdansk 1:3, but they returned the defeat at home. But now the sold-out Ljubljana Arena will leave Stožica. After today, however, they have a second medal in history, in Paris they can improve the unexpected silver from the European Championship four years ago.
At the previous European Championship, the Slovenians finished eighth, up to the Czech national team.
Technology companies want to govern our cities
Francis Fukuyam has made history a little. In 1992, at the height of a wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist in his most famous book The End of History and the Last Man wrote: "What we may be witnessing... is the final point of the ideological development of humanity and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the ultimate form of governance."
Twenty-six years later, we are more likely to see, from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland and from Hungary to Italy, rather illiberal models win, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism thrive. Fukuyama’s current book Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment attempts to cope with the onset of these forces. As his interview by George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, many of his former opinions are reconsidered: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be returned to public space, and Marx was right in many ways. At the same time, he insists that his thought development is still in line with the position of the 1990s, and critics have not understood the end of history and the last man correctly.
“What I said back then was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that it provides peace and prosperity, but people want more than that... Liberal democracy doesn't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it to individuals who feel alienated, they don’t see meaning, and therefore they unite into groups according to identity that give them a sense of belonging.”
In its time, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument for Marxists who perceived communism as the final stage of history. When Fukuyama is asked how he now perceives the mouth of the Socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "It all depends on what socialism you mean by socialism. If we are talking about the ownership of the means of production, then, except when the clear services of the public are in demand, I do not think it will work. But if you mean redistribution programs that are trying to solve a huge imbalance in income and wealth, we already witness, then yes. I don't think he could come back, he should come back. The long period kicked off by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came to the word, had a disastrous effect in many ways.”
In the end, Fukuyama tries to calm the current situation, and all liberals warn that even the emergence of new not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
The soldiers are rehearsing, pull down the curtains. China prepares celebrations at the site of the massacre
The army rehearsed the parade during the past weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close, and residents near the square were ordered to close the curtains. Military vehicles rolled into the square along the empty streets, and combat aircraft were circling in the sky.
Several Chinese have told Reuters that they are proud to expose their country to its military strength. But one woman said it was hard to deny that she would disturb other countries' celebrations.
Apparently, she was referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where the election is approaching. But they may also be in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people repeatedly demonstrate against the Chinese-addicted administrator.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside of Beijing. The South China port of Sia-men performed a special light show on Thursday night. Sia-men lies opposite the island of Taiwan and is one of the ten most innovative cities in China.
Before the anniversary, the list of forbidden things is growing. There are already drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, radio and radio wave devices, the Guardian reported. He added that China's popular social networking site Weibo is erasing "harmful political information."
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the oar) despite all the predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, a Chinese woman who is engaged in China. "This is the moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949 when the Communists led by Mao Zedong won the fighting with Chiang Kai-sheks who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 60's, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime in Tiananmen Square massacred thousands of pro-democratic protesters from among students and workers.
Since the late 70's, China has increasingly taken over the elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, the mixture of the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and the persecution of the opposition) and (Crickensian) capitalism (exploits of workers) is now a mixture of the worst.
Czechs or children banned. CTIA reveals discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, misinformation about prices and non-compliance with the principles of honesty of sales.
In one case, discrimination refuses to allow smaller children into the company in Prague. According to the CTIA, the CTIA states that the facility is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "On the electronic question of the consumer, whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child at the age of four, the restaurant employee electronically replied that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," Fröhlich added.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to let Czech-speaking people at the table, while he allowed the English-speaking. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of a consumer, was not allowed to sit at the table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do this," the CTIA spokesperson described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. Since they are not yet finalized, the spokesperson of the inspection could not provide further information about the aforementioned restaurants.
However, discrimination occurred only in a very small part of restaurants controlled in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA carried out 139 inspections. Apart from the two cases of discrimination, 64 cases have been found to have other misconduct. Mostly, these were deficiencies in compliance with the principles of honesty of sales and not informing the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
On Wednesday, the inspection reported cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged amounts higher than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, the final fines of 60 000 crowns have already been imposed.
On holiday with a credit card only? NEO account offers withdrawals from ATMs around the world for free!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying by card. The main reasons include, in particular, comfort, safety, but also the possibility to use travel insurance, which is often associated with a credit card.
Comfort when paying by card can be appreciated by travelers in almost every corner of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today payment cards are accepted almost everywhere. “People who travel more often, for example, for work, do not have time to go to exchanges repeatedly to exchange cash. And even "holidaymakers" don't want to rely on the cash to suffice. In addition, some foreign currencies do not even have Czech banks or exchange offices. For NEO account, we have therefore solved this so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs free of charge, wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communications and Press Secretary of the Expobank CZ.
In addition, a credit card is a much more reliable way to lose your money. If the lost full wallet, its owner may not wait for the money he wore in it. However, if she only loses his credit card, he can easily block it by phone or internet banking immediately. In a quick act, he does not have to suffer any financial loss at all. “In addition to its reliable protection, to store money in a bank account has other advantages. For a NEO account, for example, it is an interest rate of 1.6% per annum, which is among the highest among current and savings accounts. Its establishment and administration takes place completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100 thousand euros and the account management is completely free of charge," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone who is going abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay by card online, you can do it even at the last minute. However, the actual ownership of a payment card often means insurance protection when traveling. "For example, for embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign trips to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they travel. They often have to avoid any other furnishing," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it applies to all activities that travelers plan to take.
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The head of the children's clinic is building an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
The album Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few people know that she is a foreigner.
In the Czech Republic, there are hundreds of medics from abroad who could stay here and work. A pediatric clinic in Motol, Prague, Prague, tried to get some of them.
In order for Tara Hussein Tayeb to arrive at the Motol Hospital in Prague around 5am, she had to get up a lot. A Kurdie with short-cut hair flew to the Czech Republic from Suleimania, a town in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and in the afternoon she still treats small patients as part of private practice. In addition, he teaches at the university.
Spill in par. In Indianapolis, he is on the edge of progress after the first round
Golfer Klára Spilková is on the edge of the final round after the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she played two birdies, two bogeys, and finished the opening day on par. With a result of 72, it is in a split 69th place, which is an estimated cut.
Twenty-four-year-old Spilkova returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month health break and did not make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She indulged in rest due to fatigue and exhaustion after a broken illness.
The first Czech winner of the professional tournament for the European LET series is the first year of the LPGA Tour and so far she is not doing very well. Of the twelve tournaments, she went through the cut three times, best of her 32nd in Hawaii. He struggles to keep the card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was played best by Korean Hor Mi-CHung. After the first round, he scores -9 and a lead of two shots over three opponents.
The Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast thrived
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight increase. The PX index rose 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. It was drawn up by Czech banks, the telecommunications company O2 and the technology company Avast. On the contrary, the Austrian titles and the media company CME did not succeed. This is according to the results of trading on the exchange website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and eventually ended with a small profit. "However, for the whole week (the PX index) lost slightly over one percent," said Josef Dudek of Fio banka.
Domestic banks have partially corrected the declines from the past days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Avast shares were up 0.89 percent to CZK 113, and the operator O2 gained 0.46 percent to CZK 216.50.
Kofola’s securities grew the most, by 1.38 percent to CZK 294. Less than a percentage was acquired by the tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares increased to 13 640 crowns.
The securities of the CEZ energy company stagnated at Thursday's value of CZK 520.
The lost three titles were three titles - Erste Bank wrote off 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and insurance company VIG 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The crown weakened slightly against the two major currencies. It lost four cents to 25.85 CZK/EUR per euro, and three cents to 23.62 CZK/USD for the dollar. This is according to data on Patria Online.
My heart is like a bell and a non-smoker's lung. I'll just have a few infusions, joked Zeman
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, the doctors did not find any "diseinful conditions" with the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors at the president revealed slight signs of dehydration during the check. His low-pressure problems were caused by just inadequate watering. "To fix the dehydration of the organism, I will have some infusions that will get minerals into my body," Zeman said.
Otherwise, however, the director of the ÚVN stated that "The Czech state has a healthy president". In this context, the president mentioned that Zavoral had received several hate messages due to a health check.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not leave out a single seat on his body. "So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, as if it wasn't a smoker, the liver acts as if I'm abstinent, the kidneys are fine too, and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The editorial board of iDNES.cz turned to the military hospital to comment on Zeman’s statement of her health.
The issue of Zeman’s health became a topic especially at the time of last year’s presidential election or during some public appearances, during which Zeman has clear problems with walking. According to Prague Castle, the president walks poorly because of diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low pressure and he hears worse. He cut back on smoking because of his health.
Scientists are looking for toddlers with a birth defect in their study, the so-called valgosity of the ankles
Valgosity (sowing up) of the ankles is a congenital defect that affects five to ten percent of children. It is treated with intensive exercise as standard. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special footwear that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children with a diagnosis to map the effect of both groups. Participation in the research will not have any risks for children and the measurement will be completely painless,” explains Marta Gimunová, Head of Research at the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study through the website, where the registration form and all information are available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children with a diagnosis and fifty children healthy. From each group, half will always wear medical shoes, and half will not.
“The moment when parents should register their child is the moment when they embark on the first separate steps, typically the furniture they stick to when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child’s first steps, each of which takes about 20 minutes, for half of the participants also includes wearing tested shoes,” Gimunová said.
Pike in a pond or a relatively affluent open-air museum?
Babiš chose statistics such as good security (Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt. Or the fact that our country is, according to one recent study, the twenty-fourth in quality of life out of 140 evaluated countries.
In a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit, developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot also listed other, not so "pink" data. For example, the Czech Republic is at 154th place in the world at the speed of construction proceedings. It may be that the current economic boom will not leave any significant architectural heritage as it was in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also a slow, inexperienced bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies, in which the Czech Republic significantly lags behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet managed to make good use of the potential for the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. It is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, but people with a better standard of living will also want to have somewhere to live, to travel modernly and quickly, to have quality cultural stalls, live without an unbearable environmental burden.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, for years, the internal and external circuits or build a high-speed railway or metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally bold national library, concert hall, or national gallery. The reason for this is not only absurd scrambles about architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a specificly Czech conservatism, which sticks to the motto "every bolder change is for the worse".
And when it seems that something bolder could succeed, it will almost certainly be thwarted by conservationists or other somewhat smeared associations, or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding the "blob" of Jan Kaplický designed for the new building of the National Library, President Václav Klaus even wanted to tie himself to the excavators.
The list, however, does not end in Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone highway network or start building train high-speed trains, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for super-fast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "departure" through Bavaria. In addition, repairs of existing infrastructure are also sometimes drowning in the schlendrian. Getting quickly from Prague to Brno is now made a mess.
Babiš came into politics with a promise to "manage things". When it comes to meaningful investments and the acceleration of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, not much has happened yet. Since 2018, the amendment to the Act on Accelerating the Construction of Transport Infrastructure has been in force, but we will have to wait for the more extensive favorable effects of, for example, easier expropriation of land. And the new building law, approved by the government, which is said to shorten the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will begin, if we are lucky, is said to apply from 2021. Many people probably wouldn’t bet on it.
Unbited wants $45 million from the state
According to the spokesperson of the Office Vladimír Řepka, the Ministry of Justice has so far received six applications in this connection and is now analysing them. The young man was in prison for assaulting a woman for two years, but the judiciary eventually acquitted him.
The appeal in the case was not filed by the Supreme Public Prosecutor Pavel Zeman and the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec Public Prosecutor’s Office indicted the then twenty-year-old student of the Nečesaný Grammar School. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman in the head several times with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life was saved by doctors of the hospital in Hradec Králové.
Uncombed refused any guilt from the beginning. "I'm innocent and I swear to that. I am sincerely sorry about what happened to the victims, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man, who did not deny that he was on the hairdresser on the fateful day. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after the woman told him he was closing. He then turned himself in to the police as a witness.
At first, the hairdresser did not recognize him as an aggressor during the interrogation, but later called Nečesaný an attacker. According to forens, she suffered memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Králové Regional Court gradually handed down five verdicts in the case. At first, he found Nečesený guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Nečesný gradually headed behind bars twice, but each time he was freed after the Supreme Court intervened. After the ordered exchange of the court, the reciprocating verdicts were finally handed down, the last one in March this year the High Court upheld.
At the same time, the chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, said in the reasoning of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but he said, due to the procedural situation, he did not have a better option. He said the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal had been dismissed, even though her appeals were justified.
"The problem with this thing is not that there is a lack of evidence, but an evaluation of it. We believe that in the pre-trial proceedings there was a sufficient amount of evidence that would be richly sufficient for the recognition of guilt in another criminal case," Lněnička said.
However, the Hradec Králové, but also the Supreme Court, looked at the case differently and their opinion would probably not change the further annulment of the acquittal.
Epilepsy complicates his love of sport, thanks to surgery has new hope
For the first time, Honzík's parents noticed that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always looked into the space for a few minutes, immobilized, and did not respond to anyone. Therefore, the pediatrician sent him to a pediatric neurological clinic, where doctors after a series of examinations established a diagnosis of epilepsy and immediately put on drugs that did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find an ideal combination of medications that completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, his doctors dropped his medication, and because the seizures did not return, his parents believed that Honza was healthy and began to lead him to sport more. He rode his bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing with his sister and friends. At the age of eleven, however, he had another seizure and it all started again.
Doctors re-tested various combinations of drugs, but this time nothing worked, seizures in the form of absences were constantly repeated. Since he always stopped perceiving the attack of Honza, his parents were terrified that he would get him in sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped riding his bike and replaced the downhill skis with cross-country skis and snowboards. Although the sport had a seizure from time to time, he never gave up on it. He even fulfilled his dream and ran the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who kept an eye on him to help in case of an emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, the parents decided to try to change doctors and contact experts at Motol University Hospital. After a series of examinations, local doctors decided that Honza is a candidate for surgery to remove the focal site from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. "I had to do 2 surgeries in a row, first the doctors in my brain operated probes that scanned its activity, then they were able to remove the deposit. It was a few weeks of hell for me. I just had to lie down and almost not move, my head was stuck with wires that were connected to the computer," Honza recalls.
The operation was successful and doctors removed the relatively large deposit. "The first days after the operation it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost not speaking. Compared to how alive and communicative he is, this was a terrifying change, but fortunately, after a few days, everything went back to normal," the mother describes, adding: "A month and a half after the operation had 1 seizure, but according to doctors it happens. He's been without a fit since then for 3 months."
This school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and began to cooperate with the Company E, with which he goes to the discussions about epilepsy. So far, Honza is not fully engaged in sports activities, he begins to return to the sport slowly. "I am learning how to do sports properly, how to breathe well so that I do not expose my body to sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, the traditional EPPI canoeing triathlon, where the patients with epilepsy and health athletes meet and which takes place already this weekend on 28 September 2019 at the Veselská Písň plant, will not actively participate. But next year, perhaps, yes.
XXX Lutz can buy a competitor Kika, authorized by the office. But there's a catch
"The Office for the Protection of Competition has authorised, subject to the fulfilment of the structural obligations laid down in favour of maintaining effective competition, the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and by Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other," said Martin Švanda, spokesman for the Office of the Office.
XLCEE- Holding, in addition to the XXX Lutz chain, owns Möbelix stores. If it were to absorb the Kika chain, it would occupy too much part of the furniture and accessories market in the Czech furniture market. Therefore, part of the purchased company must be sold off.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, antitrust authorities must authorize the transaction. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from Signa was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kika last year at a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish company IKEA.

The Library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with an exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of Roman and Czech King Wenceslas IV, people in Prague’s Klementinum can see today and Saturday. The National Library has released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Václav's death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in the showcases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free, it is open both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
The exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the royal office and the library of Wenceslas IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archives. The National Archives looks at the written heritage from the time of the reign of Wenceslas IV from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the perspective of literary works, its author Jan Vojtíšek said.
"Visitors can look forward, for example, to the work of agriculture Petra de Crescentiis, which is basically an encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, i.e. a prayer book of one of the Benedictines of the Monastery of the St. Jiří at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15 century," he enumerated the reasons why people should look at the exhibition according to him.
The Epistles of Peter of Blois will also be exhibited, where the semi-state of King Henry II of England is depicted in the opening miniature of H (enrico). The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslas IV, also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see the Latin adversarial of the tracts of John Wycliff from about 1411 to 1414.
Not a book has been preserved from the Václav IV Library in the Czech Republic. According to experts, this library was one of the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at that time, because the young king longed for the construction of a representative library that would match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library disappeared soon after Václav's death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed in the conquest of the castle of the Hussites. Several codes have been saved. Most of them are owned by the Austrian National Library today.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exposed and accessible to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the digital library Manuscriptorium," said Martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.
On Saturday's public holiday, an exhibition entitled What is hidden under the floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will be opened in Klementinum for free.

Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! In light hair she rejuvenated
Film Saxon Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she celebrates her jubilee in November, she never looked like a pensioner. And now she's helped. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who had her hair interwoven with gray color, wore sedentary things and went into society sporadically. She always cared for herself, and the older she gets, the more she can untie herself in looking at her image.
Fortunately, it did not succumb to the trend of plastic surgeries and takes care of the skin with the help of good old-old indulons. And her anti-wrinkle recipe pays off. But now she's changed her hair color and she's absolutely out of it.
When she came to a social event where celebrities said goodbye to the summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was still dressed in a yellow coat that brightened her even more.
The ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate that even on the threshold of the seventies they can take risks with the appearance. And it paid off Peter, it looks at fifty at the most.
