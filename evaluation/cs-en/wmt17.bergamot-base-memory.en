Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco store
The twenty-eight-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim’s brother says he doesn’t think who would want to hurt him, and adds, “He’s finally started to do well.”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a twenty-eight-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was previously a rank-and-file chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for the restaurant Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed" by his death.
“We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss him very much,” the spokesperson said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in the hostels, but that recently he “finally started to thrive.”
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to take part in any argument.
He was a brother who took things as they are.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an uncut diamond that he lit up every day,” he said.

Czech Railways has invested more than 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested more than 31 billion crowns in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernization in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, Czech Railways has invested more than 31 billion crowns in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in the reduction of the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years in classic wagons.
A larger share of the investment was put by the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money was directed, and 40 percent was invested by the company in the renewal of vehicles for long-haul transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years old.
However, upgraded older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernization of vehicles were not foreseen, the average age of ČD propulsion vehicles would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger carriages are slightly older, whose average age when modernizations are accounted for is 23 years.
If only age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, classic trains composed of wagons and drawn by a locomotive have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways in recent years and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive decreased from 280 to 223 units, similarly the number of classic wagons from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was especially relieved of old vehicles equipped with leatherette seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
From the investments that ČD plans to make in the near future, it is possible, for example, to mention the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds of up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic expressway.
The contract foresees the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
Authorities have known about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We are utterly helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editors of the online daily Aktuálně.cz have been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where there is not only a tourist interesting walk in the treetops, but also the Olympic park.
The highway managers know they're standing there black, but they're saying they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of similar ads across the country.
According to officials, a feeble law is to blame, due to which it is not possible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
A complex bureaucratic wheel is needed first.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Motorways admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main route from České Budějovice to Lipno, an advertising billboard stands on our property by the state road.
But even three months were not enough for officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one minds that he's standing next to the road, in a fifty-foot protection zone, where nothing can stand for safety.
Road administrators say they simply cannot cope with the billboard because of the leaky law.
Maybe load it and take it away.
"We must not just afford this," says Nina Ledvinová, a spokeswoman for the Directorate of Road and Motorways, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that must prevent the removal of the billboard under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to be closely monitored by the online daily Aktuálně.cz in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that cannot be solved by the state and the authorities effectively and quickly.
In South Bohemia alone, the editors counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the roadway.
Other countries are the same.
"We have difficulties forcing the company to remove the banners," confirms Jiří Klása, the head of the transport department of the Regional Authority in České Budějovice, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to Klása, a leaky law is to blame, which binds officials.
First, he has to address the owner of the billboard in order to put the ad away.
But the bosses of companies are often unbeatable or know the trick that Aktuálně.cz has already described in the past when it became more interested in the issue: it is enough to move the mobile stand with advertising by a few meters and officials can throw the previous call for the removal of black advertising in the trash.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new device and we have to address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law will not help.
The change could be brought about by a new law, which will ban billboards at motorways from September next year and limit them even on 1st class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities won't be so relieved.
Companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on illegal land rentals and no one can do it.
For example, the billboard appealing to Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the České Budějovice Municipality is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with her for black-built billboards.
The company faces a three-hundred-thousand-dollar fine in each proceeding.
These are more advertisements that were placed without permission in the protection zone of the 1st class road.
The proceedings are not yet concluded, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the České Budějovice Municipality.
The advertisement, which Aktuálně.cz is interested in, does not yet figure among these cases, but will most likely be added to them soon.
According to ŘSD spokeswoman Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will get on the table to regional and then probably municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that fails to contact.
It does not take over the post office and canceled the official headquarters in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company’s post office went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard leases the areas of Comerz Billboard and offers them to advertisers, has rejected any connection in the past.
This spring, when the ŘSD became interested in advertising for Lipno at Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had civil servants send a letter for the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his guesthouse, where the newly company is supposedly based.
However, no one has heard from this address to the highway administrators to this day.
A futile fight.
Similar silences or opaque changes in settlements are not uncommon.
One company was gradually fined for two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed her name and ID and there was nothing to deal with.
The executive returned the case, the ads stood on, perhaps in other places.
We are quite powerless against such companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admits one official on condition of anonymity.
No one has yet addressed the amendment to the law in this regard.
Currently.cz has spoken to several members who were interested in the problem.
They have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards on major Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national but also for regional and municipal politicians a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand, they themselves need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I don't give the relatively established impression that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change the law.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rape and poppy seeds, statisticians estimate.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Still, this year's crop exceeds the average over the past five and ten years.
On the other hand, the harvest of rapeseed (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tonnes of grain.
This is according to the estimate, which according to the state of 15. The Czech Statistical Office published July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and he projected a tenth drop from last year.
Last year's grain harvest was above average.
This year's crop exceeds the average for the past five or ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rape and poppy seed will be higher this year.
Rapeseed growers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The projected decline in cereal production is due both to a decrease in the hectare yield of 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the crop area.
Farmers have donned three percent fewer fields this year.
Winter wheat, which is the most important grain for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvesting 3.3 percent less this year.
The farmers put her in multiple fields.
However, the decline will be signified by a lower hectare yield, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
About a fifth of the decline is predicted by statisticians in spring barley, which is most often used for the production of beer.
The reduction in crops is due to a 15.2 percent reduction in crop areas, but also a lower hectare yield.
Winter barley, by contrast, is born 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of rye will also increase.
The crop of rape is estimated by statisticians at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more than last year.
The crops expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hectare yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rape crop will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, while sown is a third more extensive on the area than it was a decade ago.
In the last four years, poppy fields have also been increasing.
This year, farmers have planted it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when the poppy was grown in the Czech Republic on a record 70 000 hectares, however, the fields are half.
Thanks to the expansion of the seed areas, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise 2.5 percent against last year to 27 423 tonnes.
But the hectare yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police officers charge two men for knife and machete attack, court sent them to custody
Police have charged two attackers who attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete in the centre of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, they caused him cut and cut wounds, which required treatment in the hospital and other treatments," police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
Both obvious perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack by officers.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to take them into custody and the court granted him on Friday.
Both men face between three and ten years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a thirty-five-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him cuts and cuts, the man ended up in hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that happened at noon on Svoboda Avenue on Tuesday, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
A mass skirmish between two families took place in the garden in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with the help of a knife and a machete.
Although the assaulted man tried to escape, they caused him cut and cut wounds that required treatment in hospital and other treatments, a police spokeswoman said.
The scuffle, which attracted a lot of attention in the city center and because of which several police patrols and officers had to intervene on the spot, were family disputes.
Criminals have charged a thirty-four-year-old man from Slovakia and a thirty-seven-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to take them into custody and the court upheld him on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
The machete was also used in the center of Olomouc in a mass fight five years ago, it happened only a few dozen meters further, in front of the disco Varna in Riegrova Street.
Police said at the time that a group of roughly ten foreigners with guns had attacked the guests of the business who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, you might be walking around them every day.
One of the most glaring examples of an unused and empty house is the vast building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážné Square.
It should have been operating as a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That it is necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several apartment buildings, which, despite their location, size and often monument protection, are only empty and empty.
We chose the properties in the center using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty real estate in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relations between companies or belong to a state that does not know or want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

The Clintons earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars have been donated to Clinton for charity.
Most of Clinton's revenue - over six million dollars - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
U.S. Democrats' presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax statements on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, AP reported.
Most of Clinton's revenue - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign ahead of the election.
The tax report showed that the Clintons paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, and then an income tax at the state and local levels of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar move, so far he has not committed to the publication of the tax return.
There is a certain possibility that Donald Trump pays no taxes at all, Clinton tweeted a few minutes after the publication of her return.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrets surrounding Trump's income, among other things, to raise doubts about whether her opponent is really as wealthy as she claims, the AP reported.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower earnings would damage the reputation of the Republican nominee as a successful businessman.

In Nigeria, polio broke out again.
The Islamists from Boko Haram prevented a consistent vaccination and killed the doctor.
Cases of polio have resurfaced in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government declared an extraordinary vaccination, because two children infected with the disease were paralyzed here.
The vaccines were delivered by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were active, who defended the vaccination and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was circulating there undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, an extraordinary vaccination of children against polio will begin, as two children infected with the disease have been paralyzed there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children will be inoculated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly delivered polio vaccines to the affected northeast of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are active.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating unobserved in the area for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have defended vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible on Thursday for doctors to reach areas where children with polio were detected.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for the eradication of polio Michel Zaffran told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria will begin as early as next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in the state of Borno.
The area was only made available to international organizations and the government earlier this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country in a fundamental way.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that new polio cases are very disappointing for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce next year that the polio was eradicated in it.
The WHO cautioned that although the disease did not appear for two years, it nevertheless spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While in 1988 there were still polio in 125 countries, now it persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the troubled stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps thanks to police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensification of the fight against it.
Pope Francis met twenty former prostitutes in Rome, who were freed by police from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the troubled stories of the fallen women and subsequently urged them to look confidently into the future, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
With the visit, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensification of the fight against him, the Pope's spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican this April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France strikes jihadist factories.
Without the help of Muslims, this will not be possible.
France is to be helped by Muslims in the fight against radical Islamism.
Moreover, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is planning fundamental changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
We have closed 20 mosques and prayer rooms since last December.
And more will follow, the interior minister announced.
There are over a hundred jihadist factories in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only the imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer rooms.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
Because of this, then, preachers who can sow radicalism in France get into the mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the prime minister added.
The key to ensure his goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, is currently active in the country.
Even then, the foundation was supposed to contribute to making financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon struck by internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, there was already a debate about a new institution that would replace the dysfunctional foundation.
It was all hastened by other terrorist attacks in France carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently said that a new foundation will be established this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise the imams.
For now, it is unclear where he will take the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One is a special fee or tax on halal food.
In practice, the sellers of halal food would pay for the provision of certification.
Some of this money would then go to the foundation’s pocketbook.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30 000 of them go there on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have undergone special education programs at French universities should be in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the sermon is consistent with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
The French government is also in a campaign against radicals.
And more will follow, the interior minister recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who proclaim hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are estimated to be about 2500 mosques and prayer rooms in the country.
An estimated 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled about 80 imams and consider it for several other dozens.
But not everyone thinks that the government’s actions can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This does not happen in mosques, young people are radicalized on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Centre for Scientific Research.
Tracker Kelemen lost in Round 1 of the sprint to star Baugé.
The Czech track cyclist must fight for the eight-final in repair rides.
After qualifying for the sprint, Pavel Kelemen, the track cyclist Pavel Kelemen, lost to French great Gregory Baugé, a silver defender from previous games in London, after qualifying for the top eighteen.
He has to fight for the eight-final in repair rides.
27 riders were placed at the start of the royal discipline on the track and the best Czech trackman of the present time claimed the 14th best time.
He made the two-hundredth with a brief start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main knockout stage, he was expected to qualify for the fifth Baugé, who already has a bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
In the end, Kelemen was intruding on an experienced Frenchman, but he kept the procedure.
A great performance flashed defending gold Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old Briton clocked the third-fastest two-hundredth in history and won the qualification in the Olympic record of 9,551.
As expected, he also managed with the last advancing, which was the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet also managed to line up with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50.570 in the 4 km fighter race and advanced to the final.
The previous maximum (3:51,659), which belonged to the British four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the industry
Young doctors' representatives have gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over the new treaty.
The Council of Young Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must seek full advice for the support of other industry events in early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to resolve the issues over the treaty.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members released Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "concerned" on the issues, prompting a velo to reject the contract.
She said: "In this light, the JDC executive body, by voting, decided to reject the proposed new treaty altogether and to request new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government's silence today, the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special BMA Board meeting to approve the running program of escalated industry events of early September.
The dispute led young doctors this year to announce into six strikes, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
Leader of junior doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after a decision to reject the agreed terms of the treaty, which the BMA recommended.
He told BMA members in meetings before the vote in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the health minister said the treaty would impose a burden on the medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of the “incompatible”?
It was a gesture that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to the eight-month-long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterparty in the luxury hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more for this reconciliation.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin didn't smile, and he was barely radiating warmth, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken about his “dear friend” Mr Putin – five times, as reported by one of the reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their level before the crisis, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that emanated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: The shooting down of a Russian warplane by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction back then was furious.
Putin dealt wounds around him and accused Ankara of putting a knife in Moscow's back.
The scandal was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
State-controlled media have waged a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly it looked like the Turks were to blame for everything.
More serious were the allegations from top state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting came only because Putin received the apology he demanded of President Erdogan.
Russia could also declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a ceasefire are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost deprived of power last month during a failed coup and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly rocked him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a harsh impact - primarily the cancellation of charter flights, which carry several million Russian tourists on the coast of Turkey every year.
That number decreased by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will surely relax when flights are restored.
They earn on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey were allowed again.
“Tourists there, tomatoes back here,” as the news in the Vedemosti newspaper proclaimed.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what he considers a feeble reaction to the coup attempt.
In addition, long-standing animosity lengthy talks on joining the EU and Putin's entry - which is eager to allow the cooling to take advantage of and break Turkey's bonds with the West.
The Russian leader certainly earned bonus points when Ankara asked him for the help of elected authorities after attempting a coup.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace to Russia and Turkey has allowed me to demonstrate what one of the analysts described to me as a “companion of the incompatible”: how the forces of the two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West are joining forces.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took on the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that after nearly three hours of opening talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
Turkey's president deliberately challenged the answer to a question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight those differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two states can find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of utter disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's chief executive, the RBS brand is to be suppressed into the back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland is lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Of these, she eased when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from the debt.
At the time, strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sport, from the Six Nations rugby championship to Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to make more stand-alone for national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the headquarters and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that get more prominent - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
While traveling to customers and staff at Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and brand for which our employees work, because we are now much more becoming a bank of brands."
Because the bank itself has become a global brand, it has become a global brand and RBS.
Now I say we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, has prepared a profile of individual brands of sponsorship of the sport.
“It’s a good time for us to move on to the brand bank, because the basic question (we ask ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?”
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had said we would become a great bank for customers and presented those brands.
But along with the way we focused on customer needs and not our own, I think there are a lot of changes happening.
We can remind these brands again, I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori led the 3000th winner to the finish in Newmarket on a horse, Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory in Newmarket brought him 3000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in Britain at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track - on horse Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden.
The forty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in flat races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jelly Dettori, who had previously won on a Ghayyar horse, said: "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is here, too
I'm extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I docked 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not the Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on the ground with 20 000 people.
I'm relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after the victory
Two jockeys have reached this milestone in obstacle racetracks - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has led more than 4,300 winners to the finish during his career breaking records.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached the milestone achieved before him by only a few riders.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from the other riders in the barrage.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just ride on weekends and big races, he would already have 6 000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie has been riding a winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
It has a lively nature, which is good for British horse racing. But more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous, flying jump
From brief finishes to brief jumps - Frankie Dettori has been a delivery of British flat races for two decades.
It was like a roller coaster ride.
A plethora of big race winners, including his well-known "Great Seven" in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and was banned from launching for drugs.
Three years ago, he first stagnated when he returned after a 6-month start ban, but he demonstrated incredible inner strength and all the doubters despite returning in best shape.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin releases Presidential Office Chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov has been one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
Sixty-three-year-old Ivanov has been appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin "released Ivanov from his service to the head of the Russian presidential office," but there was no reason.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno was formerly a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) says he later became head of the presidential protocol and presidential office.
In appointing Putin, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the head of state in the sense of drafting laws and checking the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from the post and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Will he convince smiles?
This step completely mystified Moscow.
For a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, the two men said they were leaving the post of head of the presidential office at their own request.
But the smiles to the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once thought of as a possible president was eager to suddenly lead Russia's environmental policy has been met with great disbelief.
The Kremlin’s website quotes remarks to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to confide this very challenging post, even a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I've been the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up his post in December 2011.
He previously held the post of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest associates.
There was even speculation that Ivanov might succeed Putin after his second term, because the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
This post was taken over by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, the star of The Thoughts of a Criminal, was released after hitting the director
Gibson became involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS television, which produce the series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before announcing his firing.
There have been creative differences in the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry that this happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS statements, details of how the character of Gibson disappears from the series, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, are a little later.
The 45-year-old actor, best known for her lead roles in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has appeared in the series since his first series in 2005.
"I love the Thoughts of a criminal, and over the past twelve years I have put my heart and soul into them," Gibson said in a statement he issued Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end. But that won't be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, great fans, what this show could ever hope for.
The series is expected to return to season 22.
In the city of Banff, fish mysteriously landed in the garden
A man from the town of Banff has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes 75 fish can be sand eels left behind by a water storm.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a short film of his find on the Periscope canal, thinking that someone might help him clarify how about a 5-centimeter-long fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
The project for 1.35 billion pounds is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
It is the first of four closures between the “fans of platforms” that are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
There are 10 000 tons of iron and 20 000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The project for 1.35 billion pounds is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers used more than 30 000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge on an impressive scale.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the platform of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary accuracy.
In its place is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last parts of the platform is now pouring in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first closure in the construction of every bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of building construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the North Tower expansion platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6 000 tons and it was necessary to pull it with a climb of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerance the team worked with was very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay: Three men are 'happy to be alive'
The three men are "happy to be alive" after being flushed out by water from their fishing boat near Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station sounded the alarm on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued uncontrolled.
"We saw their boat circling in their vicinity, and we thought of the worst," said Moelfre's lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones.
"Luckily, a stronger wind blew it away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man, aged 60, was found without a life jacket exhausted as he holds the buoy.
All were handed over aboard the coastal lifeboat and transported back to the lifeboat station
Jones said: "Three men are happy to be alive and completely uninjured.
The ship's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person driving the boat when it rolled over.
Someone from above the boys was holding a protective hand.
The judge refuses to handle the case because of Tluchoř's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who, according to the indictment, should have received political traffic from Prime Minister Nečas and his then-head of the cabinet, Jana Nagyová, a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, it was about approving the tax package.
Šnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř allowed him to resign with their resignations.
They then appeared in influential posts in state-owned firms.
That's why they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, illegally, and thus received compensation of a total of almost 2 million crowns.
The fat man is now acting as a witness in the case, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a courthouse on the Fruit Market and resolves civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be careful and prevent possible objections.
The case will probably be handled by another Prague judicial district.
Králová has already twice acquitted Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagyová.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to track Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
He wasn't involved in this case.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in this way for the court to be ruled out if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid nothing could be judged, he told the newspaper.
"It feels like a rundown," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged in the case of political traffickers.
According to his lawyer Petr Toman, however, any objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 heard 13. June indictment of the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas Jana Nagyová (now Nečasová) and other accused in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
Pictured, Nečasová and her husband come to court.
Tluchořová was supposed to deal with statements about Peroutek.
The ex-deputy's wife was supposed to judge President Miloš Zeman's remarks about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutek.
Zeman said he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl was apparently killed in an air raid by Allied forces.
She and her two equally old girlfriends flew to Syria last February from London's Gatwick Airport.
The British Home Office did not comment on the report of her death.
The young Londoners, who fled their home, were secretly taken to Syria across the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana have gone to see their other former classmate from London's Bethnal Green Academy school, according to media reports.
The case last year drew a huge wave of attention and also tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that some 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them have joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for a hundred thousandth salary.
A great job you don’t even need college for.
That's what the job of an I.T. guy looks like at first glance.
And often on the other.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary in Czech conditions (in Prague you earn up to 180 000 Kč by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to the lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
It is estimated that almost 20 000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most sought-after, according to statistics from the Grafton recruitment agency, programmers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Not competing for a job, but a job for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for IT.
Higher education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate’s intelligence and educability, but it often has not much to do with knowledge of development.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which will not be replaced by a graduated university, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most money is earned in Prague.
Itian wages are everywhere far above the national average.
The most money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a chart.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
Technical directors will reach the highest earnings.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 Kč.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but even there it does not fall below 80 000 Kč.
IT project managers are also in demand.
At the onset they can earn 60 000 - 100 000 Kč.
The fight is also for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the Labour Office, this is not the case with IT.
If companies are to be dragged and overpay an expert from another company, they like to reach for a graduate.
They can raise it on their own.
They can't do without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but it is necessary to have a minimum of decent English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases when companies are looking for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker controls more foreign language, he is interesting to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds Director Kubačka.
Yeah, at Google, there's paradise.
Only quietly envious Czech workers can envy employees at Google.
Of course, there is flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various short-time work, not only for mothers.
"The company provides new dads with four weeks of extra leave after the birth of the baby," said Martina Jonek, a Google spokeswoman.
Snailing also includes health care for employees and family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massages directly in the workplace.
Anyone who wants to learn has a green light, no matter what new you want to learn.
But the benefits do not end there.
Such a full refrigerator for free is also definitely not to be thrown away.
Healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microkitchens in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the speaker reveals.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, so what doesn't get eaten, puts in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these incredible advantages on Czech conditions?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“It’s not important for Google that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or development, ideas, and innovative solutions.”
The United Nations has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN's Human Rights Commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "sparks serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He warned that "it is particularly worrying to witness how important and influential public figures express public support for criminal armed militias that are brazenly holding hunts for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory in an irregular way are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
Even worse, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite everyone having the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has arrested 14 000 migrants this year, and 21 000 last year for the same period.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people have been lamenting over the last decade that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time over screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off the sofas and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens originally shrunk to TV, later to video games and most recently to smartphones.
It's great to see that the technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
I'm talking, of course, about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game in early July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and nearly as many users as Twitter has in a matter of days.
How does it work?
In short, smartphone players go out looking for Pokémon to track using GPS, and when they find them, they can “take a picture” of them (via a screenshot on your phone) or “catch.”
Mania has engulfed the generation that played the game at a younger age, lifting it from its seats and rushing out to look for Pokémon.
In the U.S., thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that an “average” person will take every day.
The Cardiogram app for Apple's smartwatch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people who exercised every day for 30 minutes has jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company doesn't have information about who Pokémon Go is playing - it only sees rough data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to make people “find 30,” “get up from the couch” and “be active every day” have fallen on barren ground, as most public health messages are boring and designed for people who don’t look good.
However, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot fully indicate here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight. And fun.
Some people even make new friends when chasing Pokémon.
As is the case, of course, there are also such boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk in the door.
And what, like?
There was a breakthrough.
In their time, smartphone apps, such as Fitbit, could track our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do anything, as is the case with this game.
The novelty is eyeing itself and the interest in it begins to fade at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity and help many people in the pursuit of activity, health and a better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
Effortlessly on the beam.
In the simple, they all got dumb.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The nineteen-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in the multi-fight on Thursday and overcame the others on the full line under the Olympic spotlights.
The overall result of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over the silver medalist and team member of the "final five" team Ala Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafinova.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a performance on the beam in the final of the individual multi-fight in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win a multi-fight, and fifth overall, confirming her reputation as her generation's best gymnast and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall finals were on the board and her long journey to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success puts her in the same league of unique athletes of her time, such as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships - including 10 golds. Her stunning lineups are a mixture of ambition and accuracy, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton described her as "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the competitors, but between herself and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning the gold and silver medals in the women's multi-fight final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was like an exclamation point in the celebration of the outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, but that's not entirely true.
Part of her line-up in the simple - the one that contains the typical triple double-turned salto for her - is set in Latin music that would just fit home, into the streets outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on the way to the gym where Boorman trained and where she gained strength.
She has not lost the competition since the summer of 2013 - this is the sequence of victories that can continue for as long as Biles will want.
Even though Mustafin took the lead for a short time thanks to two turns, it was just an illusion.
The beast and the simple - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back in the lead with 15,433 points for the beam - and finished with 15,933 points in the simple.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering red, white and blue shadows, Biles appeared tears as she fulfilled a wish she had once written down in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a retribution for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but at that time she won bronze because of the sum of the top three line-ups.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call "grandmother," was much ahead.
After her simple, she sent air kisses to the crowd, climbed by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this nineteen-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it became a complete hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a girl, aged 12, died during the most serious assault of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, chatting and listening to music.
Authorities have reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot by 12. June in a car parked in the driveway.
The report said the armed man stood on the passenger side and fired eight shots from the handgun. He then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the robbery is not behind the triple murder because the attacker did not take the wallets, nor the amount of 2,900 dollars that one of the adult victims had with him.
A spokesman for the Phoenix police, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks occurred within four months, in which seven people were killed and two other people wounded.
“It’s happening in the residential area in front of the houses,” Howard told CBS’s KPHO office earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and daughter Ellis Maleah died at the scene.
The witness told police it was not uncommon for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report of a shooting targeting an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder. Police believe that the originator was this serial killer.
Investigators found the shells and assembled a bullet from the remains of the bullets in the seat and from under the hood of the engine.
Mother of six-year-old with microcephaly: ‘His condition improves’
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mom.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is a consequence of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I first thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you're ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never know them and that she might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t think people were doing this anymore,” Picciut said.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Until the age of three, he couldn't sit or crawl. And he still doesn't talk.
However, some milestones are already slowly filling.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth demonstrates a sign language through which Edmund says, “Please sing to me.”
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not common sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as is the case with Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may differ substantially.
It's too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciut is an emotional toll that an uncertain future is taking.
I constantly ask, “What’s next?”
What's next?
And she's still not sure about it.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to be able to tell me at all.
Picciuto has an encouraging message for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding have required rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and southern Mississippi spill off its shores and threaten widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said civil servants are continuously in contact with local authorities and aid is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's office for national security and preparedness for crisis situations, said they were receiving requests for vehicles to drive in the water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said only the Tangipahoa district asked for ten thousand sandbags.
Flood patrols will remain in most of the southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The weather service said in a statement that it could rain over the sea for another 8 to 13 centimeters.
In southern Alabama, a flood patrol was on standby Friday when rains continued in the City of Mobile area.
According to the forecast, the Comite rivers near Baton Rouge and Amite near Denham Springs are due to culminate over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of homes in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that the danger is flooding downstream in the Ascension district, when these flooding streams will be poured into Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The Tickfaw River, slightly further south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest recorded levels at 9 a.m. local time on Friday.
Rescuers are still picking up people from torrential waters in County Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson, were previously among those rescued at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford (62) said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it to my waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in 48 years.
Hansford said he and all members of his family are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said crisis workers rescued all three military-style huge trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of heavy rains, flooding is "spreading rapidly" and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 inches of rain fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid trips required rescue of residents from their homes in the Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of teaching in five school districts.
A branch of WWL's CBS station announced that, according to the elder of Tangipaho, 200 homes had been flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, which are both now flooded.
The mayor of the municipality, Robby Miller, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that high water had trapped.
In the village of Amite and in the town of Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They'll be able to come home when the water starts to fall," he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in the Tangipahoa precinct in Hammond due to the flood, and locals were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had our last major floods here in March," said the city's administrator, Lacy Landrum.
Looks like these floods are gonna be the same.
Rupert Lacy, manager for crisis situations in County Harrison, Mississippi, said persistent rain was continuing on the Gulf coast.
He said a flooding of a couple of homes was announced on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report again on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places I've never seen her before," Townson said, "and she's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "boy shot like a solver," survives Philadelphia shooting
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia. This week marks the second shooting of a child aged 6 in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahaje Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious while transporting him to the hospital.
"He took a lot, his little body was shot through like a solution," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition in hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should be healed.
He was supposed to start first grade of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in part of Germantown.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, the other two are in stable condition.
According to the station's report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a twenty-nine-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a gunman.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was likely to be a firefight among several armed men.
At the scene, shell casings from weapons of the offensive type, belonging to various offensive weapons, were found.
It was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
So it seems that there were several armed fighting persons who were actively involved,” said Anthony Ginaldi, the captain of the Philadelphia Police.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been detained and police are reportedly examining video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray shot Tuesday in front of a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women's gymnast team for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second: There are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black women and Latin Americans at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast in the past four years has been African-American.
Simone and Gabby were in first and second place last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world winners Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who showed off unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's multi-fight of individuals.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're witnessing a sporting peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the team of gymnasts for the next Olympic Games will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year when Marta Karolyi is training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay the costs of trainings, equipment, trips, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families). And that's far from all.
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the trainings, and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes while they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training, which is more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who have been inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer gymnastics for free or with low cost in Harlem for more than 15 000 young people within the city (especially of black and Hispanic origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for having shown "girl strength" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's motion was rejected, young doctors are ready to enter the next strikes
Ministers had hoped that after the re-executed contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements over the changes would be brought to an end. But 58 percent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt in July revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying the NHS was in "no one's country" and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work practices to improve care in non-social hours.
Doctor Ellen McCourt, BMA's chairwoman for young doctors, said in a statement last night: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, primarily in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labor crisis and thus fair treatment of all doctors."
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have been met with unwillingness to engage dr and often with deafening silence from the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this possibility is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for coercion and resolve the concerns of junior doctors.”
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take the next steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100 000 visits were postponed because nurses and specialists were called in to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers had hoped that after the conclusion of the re-executed contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be disagreements regarding the changes.
BMA wants higher payments for work over the weekend for 54 000 junior doctors who would be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, has called on young doctors not to take any strikes.
Mortimer said: "By doing business action, little or nothing will be achieved, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services, and fears, exhaustion and disruptions for patients, nursing staff and their families will increase."
Over the past two months, we have held talks with the board of junior doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employers had hoped that continued positive involvement on other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after career interruptions, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay gap - was a testament to how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health take the agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A cure for sixty crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs about sixty crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend administering it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a seizure again in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after having a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHSdog watch NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140 000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another seizure or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by a build-up of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is detached, a blood clot may develop, block the blood's access to the heart and heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, block the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of another attack.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of clots occurring less likely.
The proposal for a NICE Directive, which was published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the patient’s quality of life.
Ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is shown to be effective in reducing the dangers of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand treatment options that are available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - primarily about the risk of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, treatment is not recommended in the design beyond that time.
With computer culture, fraud in Muslim areas began to flourish
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, which was linked to a government report
A culture of political correctness has led to an overlooking of spreading fraud in Muslim communities, according to a government report today.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticizes the police, election inspectors and town halls for ignoring voter abuse because of "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption crackdowns, said that intimidating voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons and deterrent voters in front of polling stations.
He recommended that voters take their identity document with them and be able to prove who they are at the election.
At present, voters just need to give their name and address.
The report also proposes to apply indelible ink to the fingers of people when casting a voice to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says
It calls for the press to have greater access to the documents from the meeting and to decisions taken by the unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that go hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of an election scandal at Tower Hamlets in west London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled, the incumbent mayor of the city of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his post after allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "cynically intervened" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
“Rahman has campaigned to be a religious duty for Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been questioned or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and gives himself up from someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the correspondent vote - which is claimed to have been put under pressure from older members of the Muslim community during it to people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, pictured, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
His report said: "Evidence has been presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote at will of the elders, primarily in communities coming from Pakistan and Bangladesh."
“There were fears that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behavior because of the ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including that political activists be banned from manipulating mail-in votes and thus preventing "voice extraction."
The report, now being evaluated by Theresa May, also asks for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and benefit fraud.
Consider asking voters to provide proof of identity before voting.
Using indelible ink on the fingers of people when voting to avoid someone voting twice.
Carrying out systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic mail-in voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
To ban political agitators and activists from manipulating surrendered mail-in votes and election envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around the polling stations.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute people exerting unlawful coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit taking of photographs at polling stations.
Require only English people (except Wales) to work at polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers follow the rule that voters go to election cabins individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election trial has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the fruitless "check check boxes" in the voter registration departments at City Hall.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in the Tower Hamlets case by waking up.
Our nation has the proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Infatuated with cycling double Duchess Kate and other doubles of well-known figures at Rio Olympics
Rio 2016 Olympics fans have gone crazy this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the twenty-four-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete seeking gold this year, boasting her own double from the ranks of well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the well-known personalities currently appearing on our screens, the column for women FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted animal: A member of the American team of archers Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Alongside Kate's double on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archer Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his images emerged, which strikingly resembles a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he had heard of his similarity with Leo since he was a child.
"He doesn't see much resemblance himself, except perhaps the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be highlighted even more this year: a striking form between British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin, with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the series' star, Gell Matthew Morrison, for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks Nathan with the “athletic version” of the actor from the movie The Beginning (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova not only boasts the same dark complexion and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, fans say he looks like "an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Proficient women: football star Hope Sol (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face and eye shape
Not just one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On the waves of theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind a similar appearance of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the site that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are in truth identical."
Football star Hope Sol and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medal winner for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, boasting with her beautifully broad smile, which seems to copy the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of the film Bravo, girls!
A CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying of the Chinese swimmer that she "exploded"
Viewers of Wednesday's live stream from the Olympic Games on the CBC station outraged by an analysis of the performance of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place of the women's race on the 4x200 m relay in a freestyle
Canada's CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "pulled like a smell" and "exploded" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald believed his microphone was off when, at the end of the women's relay final on the 4x200-meter freestyle, he began to churn out his own views.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring a "revival" to the CBC's team of commentators, said, "The little fourteen-year-old from China gave up, you know."
Too much excitement, dragged like a smell, exploded.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in a time of 1:57.79 - that is, 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to tighten up China.
Viewers in Canada began to quickly echo online and were appalled by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the announcer on the CBC declare that a fourteen-year-old swimmer from China had "blown up"????"
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay race was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides, and many demanded his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we'd be a bunch of racists.#disgust.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment, saying: "We apologize for commenting on the swimmer's performance, which leaked to the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC eventually apologized to more than 90 times to people tweeting in response to a comment
Co-commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and put their apology in response for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments from commentator MacDonald
The station also quickly apologized and released a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, she should not have gotten into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the broadcast and to those who follow us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments concerned the swimmer's performance, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by saying he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the broadcast from the Olympics on CBC.
"I meant the performance of the swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such."
“There is no need to say that I had no intention of disrespect and I am very sorry.”
Customers in Primark scandalized by a woman who shamelessly tried on her underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman took her dress to try on her panties on the sales floor in the middle of Primark, shoppers were not sure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she tried on how the size fits her, took off her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to view and eventually tried out four pairs of panties at the shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Flokestone.
A Primark store in the shopping centre of Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before returning them to the shelf
The mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman "dressed again after trying out her underwear and walked out of the store without buying anything."
She said, “People couldn’t believe their eyes.”
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own tights and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place-she was just standing there, cheeky as a monkey."
"Everyone just stared at how she took off her panties again, and evidently she didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three others before finally deciding she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was watching - not even thinking about the man who might be buying the panties she was trying."
Miss Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and no one cleared them. That's disgusting.'
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "When she left, I collected things that I obviously tried to pull them off the sale - what's also the only right one."
"I'd be scared by the idea of bringing my new panties home and finding out that another woman was wearing them, taking them off and not washing them."
A spokesman for the shop, Primark, said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9."
All products concerned have been withdrawn from sale.
How to defend against weapons attack with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, Grand Master of the Krav Magy Federation, based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain superiority over the rapist, whether he approaches you from the front or from behind.
If he approaches you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a freeway shot.”
You then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with your free elbow.
Then the knee follows into the groin, and while the attacker is writhing in pain, you wring the gun out of his hand, hit the main one in the face and start to retreat, while holding the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man from the front is approaching you, it is a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, put the force in the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from his grip and start retreating, still aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video where you can see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way to get out of the robbery - if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
A British traveler has decided to put to a heavy test his immune system and gagging reflex - by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and author of travelogues, Ian Wright, 51, originally from Suffolk, licked the euro banknote with his tongue, the Piccadilly Circus railing, the flush button on the toilet on the train and the Russian public phone.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to all of us what he was embarking on.
The experiment, which was based on the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train that thousands of other people have used may seem utterly repulsive, but there are actually a lot more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his entire journey in Europe, Ian Wright spoke with health professionals and specialists about strengthening gut flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licking left anything worse in his mouth than a taste.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the resilience of his guts on around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely - from public railings on train stations to the flusher
In the film he made about it, he says: "I haven't taken much care of my health since I was a child, and I've been putting everything in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and muddy water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio have made a traveler's film, The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows bacteria in various places, such as the bathroom
In the film, he said, "This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was shot in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company has provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help people strengthen gut bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio's senior vice president of snacks, juices and new categories, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow with interest while allowing us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We’ve come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of “let’s call Ian.”
It is said that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought consumers more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I asked him to do - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others pretty hard.
I'm glad we've licked some of those dirty things."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and gut health, and 58 percent of respondents said they occasionally used products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of socially needy before the eviction damaged a municipal building in the town of Saltash in Cornwall
The family of the socially needy left 50 000 pounds in damages to their municipal house after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in the town of Saltash, Cornwall, after a long line of complaints against them.
After their violent eviction from the house, the housing association officials were shocked to find that the property was in a state of disrepair.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, there was garbage everywhere on the floor, and the walls were scribbled.
The family has already moved out and is deemed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing issues at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about whether the house would be saved.
She said: "It's been a nightmare for people here and I don't think people should live like this.
It is necessary to consider a number of circumstances, because this property will probably come to the attention of “not so much” of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who occasionally reside in the house, and police said the terror-government the family operated included street fights using baseball bats, intimidating surrounding residents, drug use, drug distribution and loud screaming, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was given on the lease agreement, was given a sentence in June for antisocial behaviour.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, smelly garbage was found.
In the house, from where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was plucked out
Neighbors say they saw them on the street fighting, and people called the police regularly here
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the house this week after they were given an additional 11-week deadline to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors, who were relieved, welcomed the eviction, saying that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, “They didn’t care about anyone at all.”
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always like this.
How many times we've seen the police here can't be counted at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredibly quiet here - we're not used to that!
He'll be pretty here when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the oversight manager at Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said the family had failed to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly summoned by the police
The trash and old toys were lying in the overgrown part of the municipal house
She adds: "It is a shame that the tenant has failed to take responsibility for her own behavior and for her family's behavior. Eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to frighten her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who have bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring a little comfort to the neighbours and at the same time bring with it a message that we will not tolerate unsociable behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons of the tenant who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
A contaminated mattress that, after eviction, remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
Workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage left around the house
In 2014, she carried out a raid on the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was intended to base the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner, after their eviction, now live in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crow of Den and Cornwall police said the eviction was a sending a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
The police of Den and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low overflight of military jet over beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun's rays in Aveir, Portugal, were terrified to death
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight, insisting there was no threat to security
As the low-flying jet swerved over the crowded beach, the frightened tourists panicked.
In dramatic footage, a military plane can be seen getting almost to the touch from sunbathing people on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after they were disturbed by the noise of the jet's engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who released videotapes of a dramatic overflight on social media, said: "The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I surfed and I really thought the plane would fall on my head."
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a plane flying low appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force today declared that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify the fishing boat off the coast and had to bear low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The plane was reportedly flying a little lower than normal, due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that people's safety has not been compromised.
Forest fires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low because of thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boat as part of the training.
Half of the funeral services are not complying with the regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (CTIA) found this out during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services do not most often inform the survivors of their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The CTIA imposed 41 fines totalling 73,000 crowns.
This was reported today by her spokesman Jiří Fröhlich.
Inspectors found misconduct in 47 of the 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labeled and once the seller used an officially unverified gauge.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
This was related to urn wrappers, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Due to the fact that there are still violations of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee's attorney said the family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported Thursday that it was likely killed during a Russian air strike in Raqqa, which is a bastion of a group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and according to her family she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with going to the war zone - is that it will deter people from ever making decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then to a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she was widowed.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, she will keep Garland as a Supreme Court nominee.
Senate leader for the Democratic Party, Harry Reid, says he is confident that Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the supreme court if elected.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama will nominate him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person who replaces the late Supreme Court Justice will be elected by the future president.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he believes Clinton will pick Garland "with a degree of credibility."
Reid's spokeswoman later said he did not speak directly with Clinton about whether he would nominate Garland and that he was merely speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to "rock the ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is chairman of the federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's appointment are "minions" and "minion" Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for “women and men”
Treats magazine works closely with photographer David Bellemer to release a calendar for 2017, inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of exposed celebrities, he tries to find the next generation of top models for his 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his journal full of nakedness is different from Playboy from old school because “Playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
He clearly believes the calendar too.
“We have to go back to displaying timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by photos of the woman’s body,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where vinyl is going: who is really buying turntable records?
Vinyl is loved by middle-aged men alone.
Before you decide to overwhelm the comment section with peppery remarks under the pseudonym AllLigamentsMenMenIn the middle Age, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of gramophone records is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to enjoy the originality of owning a physical object, but with middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not really about accumulating an enthusiastic fan - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to preserve their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were broadcast as a television report, I would be watched by a camera as I head out into a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and widely gesturing. Then I would stop, pull my hands out, and say something authoritative, like, “Let’s take a look at it.”
So let's take a look at it.
While his charm and charm are slowly disappearing from Soho's heart - buildings once occupied by independent vendors, hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, clothing and office supplies are now filled - several fantastic specialized gramophone board stores are still left.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I will stand close to the various men in these shops and try to observe what their age and emotional state is.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has an afternoon meeting in London and looking at the shops to fill in several hours of time.
I ask him if he is a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3 or 4 thousand recordings.
All the recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me the photo by e-mail, I didn't follow him all the way home).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records that he couldn't afford when they came out originally, and he's buying again what he sold in his youth and he didn't even have a vindra.
“A lot of what I buy is from the late 60’s and the early 70’s. It's the stuff that would have been published when I was 11 or 12. I was too small back then and couldn't get it," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves. He adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who have heard of the comeback and felt forced to buy their old turntable records back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their turntable records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their turntable records back.”
This could explain the boom of lovers of gramophone records of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of turntable records?
It takes you no more than a few seconds to find out in a shop like Phonica that you will find a pleasant community of people with similar minds in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly scandalized by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of turntable records may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of gramophone record covers, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort,” Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, that's the case with me, and I think a lot of people do too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We’re all like their social workers!” echoes a co-worker from a pile of turntable records.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had yet to listen to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables do not have a turntable.
At this point in the report, he was probably seriously concerned about the passing of the pile of bossa nova compressions.
The aspect of “trophy” and the revival of interest is something noticed by Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a turntable yet, but I want to buy it on the Radiohead board so we can display it on the shelf.’”
The percentage of such is not large, but it happens.
It’s more about the product side than the music.
There are people who say, “I don’t have a gramophone.”
These are the younger people, not the older ones, the grown-up teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has much more diverse visitors when I arrived.
There are couples of seventies, tourists who take photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the stores used to be - instead of the pull-up jazz, the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex is good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly alone, but it's hard to guess when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks for a few minutes in Fopp, looking through various gramophone records at a discount.
She's one of those who looks at the shop windows rather than spending feverishly.
He doesn't make much money, so there's no way she's collecting turntable records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on your computer or something like that. But the gramophone records have their magic... ," he sighs longingly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls who are just clustering around Polaroid cameras. Then the father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by the turntable records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It’s a pure “vinyl trick.”
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for others, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where more time and money is more likely than in other areas, is also where it is most spent on the most luxurious goods, which vinyl certainly is.
But while, according to my findings, YouGov's results appear to be accurate - that is, at least in turntable records stores, they don't take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in fact, in gramophone records stores and on online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, going through recordings and avoiding the sight of a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, the Greenlandic shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years and measures five metres
Court in France refuses to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France has dismissed an order by authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to cancel a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, in makeshift restaurants selling tea for 50 cents or basic dishes for several euros.
The Prefect's office in Calais argued that places need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they pose a danger of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations have said in court that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-backed associations and other groups do not provide a food supplement for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from running 72 makeshift deals, but said the objections of Prefect Calais were "completely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a far greater role than simply serving food to people who "live in extraordinarily desperate conditions."
He said the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the camp cafe, the Jungle Book Kids, which is run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals, English and French classes a day, and asylum counseling for hundreds of unaccompanied minors at the camp.
The petition for the protection of the “children’s” cafe was signed by more than 170 000 people.
The Guardian received a letter saying that the closure of the café “was a disaster for these children, some of them are only 8 years old.”
On Friday, the charity Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer has risen to more than 9,000 - which is the most in all times.
He thought he was dead.
Ulč chives himself and volleyball Ústí.
"I've been able to train normally since March," he reported at the start of summer preparation in full force.
What have you been?
I had a double-sided pulmonary embolism, then heart problems because of it.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, no one found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There is a damaged vein in the calf, it will hurt all the time, especially when it is working or the weather is changing.
But nothing that limits me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about life?
He had.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevěnice I did not know that I had an embolism, and I could not move there at all.
I threw up blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was still completely finished for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Woods, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going to go up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to keep a closer eye on myself when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only when I wanted to return to the preparation of Příbram last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself alone at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it, physically I'm better off than before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm looking forward to it, the group looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two foreigners who will come.
I hope we sit humanly to fit in together.
Will you lift the mouth?
It had a reputation as a battering, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now it finished second.
There is a new team in Ústí, only a few players remain.
It was the last in the extra league, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first rounds who's going to be the batter, we're not.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already been experienced and he's been through a lot, he's going to think of a better than last place.
But my arrival had nothing to do with him, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a big friend with one and it was agreed that he would work here.
I'm not going to say the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He has a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been coaching for decades, he's a former good player.
He'll push us up.
What will you bring?
This team is going to fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to heck and I like to get opportunities on a not-so-top team.
I was in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, Australian Boehm is already training in Ústí.
What does he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in the group at the university.
And we had a few conversations there, sometimes we sat together in the evening after games, so we already know each other friendly.
We beat them 3:1, I immediately gave him at the start of the summer preparation in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's nice.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with an American, he looks like a nice boy, a Brazilian who knows how he will speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm the recorder, that's who I'm creating, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of players they are, I found myself playing on the internet, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the boy jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he would fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to the position of the record leader?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I will be twenty-four and I do not have the temperament to take turns.
I'd rather be at the center of the action, I'd rather have a team than be led by someone else.
I probably wouldn't want to play anymore if I was supposed to be like a second recorder and devote myself to it for full time. When something is not done to the fullest, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
A half year in Příbram, when it was not possible for Kust as captain, he got injured, then there were money problems and he left.
We've been up since then and I've played all the time.
In Brno, of which I am an offspring, I alternated one and two.
Excellent year was in the Old Town, after it I had a lot of offers and chose Příbram.
From there, Budějovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains Phelps' domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and his mother cheered in the auditorium again, his son Boomer sleeping peacefully this time with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming competitively and in a few hours it will be over, he said touchingly.
In the final behind Phelps by almost two seconds, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long position, fell behind.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to dominate the same discipline at four games in a row.
For most of the race, Phelps and Phelps were led by another American, Ryan Lochte, and homers, Thiago Perreira.
While the defending champion of gold in the final round fifty put on a crushing finish, they fell outside the medal positions.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the official announcement of the position, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter bow tie race.
The legend could not be overshadowed even by the compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the sign-up double - after a hundred won in Rio and the double track.
In the final, he left behind 37 hundredths of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third finished Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While from last year's World Championships Murphy has only fifth place out of two hundred, in Rio he became a sign king.
He deposed Larkin from the imaginary throne, who managed the same double at last year's world championship.
He won a medal at the Olympics only now.
Canadian Penny Oleksiakova and American Simone Manuel shared the gold.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiakova, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuelova the second after the silver from the relay.
She won the swimming gold at the Olympic Games as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport becomes love for them and they get to where I go, said the touched Manuel.
The third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-meter bow tie race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the double-hundred-year round.
Australian champion Cate Campbell finished sixth.
The two-hundredth was won by Japanese woman Rie Kanet, for whom it is the first Olympic medal at the age of twenty-seven.
She has no precious metal even from the World Championships, her maximum was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia's Yulia Yefimova, who is struggling with the hostility of spectators and rivals due to the start at the Games despite her doping past.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court and I don't know why I should keep answering those questions.
I'm so tired of it, the Russian swimmer said.
She only claimed the right to start in Rio at a special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the Games.
They dealt with my appeal and I won.
Whether anyone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, let them turn to the arbitration court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointing, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
It was only less than an hour before the game that they learned who they would take.
They had to handle tactical preparation in a flash.
And then, in an unconventional time, the match started on the number 1 small court.
The first set did not start well, then they took the lead of the opponents, but in the state of 19:19 they did not manage the end.
In the second, they were clearly better and leveled, but the decisive tie-break did not work out.
Above all, a number of broken serves meant losing 10:15 and saying goodbye to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann regretted.
How would you evaluate the match?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start before I started, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, in the last balloon, I missed the income I had previously gotten used to.
We lost the set, which was crucial.
In the next set we got on them with an overview on the pitch, a different defense and we pushed on the service.
There were a lot of bad serves in the tie-break, that's where we dropped on this side.
It was disappointing because we could beat the Russians.
Sluková: Too bad about the beginning of the first set, we missed it there.
We were able to pull it off, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and in the third decided the service.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and it was about the five, we hesitated a lot there.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the small court number 1?
Sluková: Similar to China in the next yard.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock at night, complete silence, the music was not playing, nothing.
That was the difference from the center.
We wouldn't choose those conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started warming up for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn't make tactical preparation like we did on the other teams.
But Simon (coach Nausch) prepared a tactic for almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of tactic-friendly papers ready, so we were pretty well prepared on this side.
Do you remember ever starting a match at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at half past eleven, but not at twelve.
Russian Birlov's block in the pre-round play-off at the Rio Olympics.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannová in the pre-round play-off at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in a group of ten, we have had the regime shifted before.
This was two hours more.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance at twelve o'clock.
But I think we've prepared ourselves the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not typical and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the progress from the group was our goal, it's fine on the one hand, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep from it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big Brother's here, the first surveillance SIM is coming.
You won't escape her.
The new rules should apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM of one of the local operators when staying in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who work in Thailand, for example, or have married there.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and the Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, has informed that there will be no exceptions.
The SIM sale plan for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
The new measure, which will allow their location to be monitored, is intended to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of preserving national security that will allow to deal with criminal activity committed by foreigners.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs are supposed to help detect people who exceed the permitted length of stay.
With dealers, a special SIM for foreigners should appear alongside SIMs intended exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This feature is not for Thais, because we can always easily track them," Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators handed out a free starter SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecoms regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are considering implementing the same measure as Thailand.
The mandatory SIM registration is currently in effect, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not imply an obligation for foreigners to purchase a local operator’s SIM when entering the country.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
After crossing the border, after logging in to their network, the operators of the country know only the relevant network information.
They know the phone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so abysmal that even most tourists start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities’ efforts to oversee the movement of foreigners have been legally criticised by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in connection with privacy protection, likens the system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if necessary, monitoring a specific person.
Any abuse of the system will threaten an undetermined punishment.
"If the service provider monitors the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number will be recycled only after the 90-day deadline for the SIM not to be logged on to the network, the number could now be restored after fifteen days if Thailand is left.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property care will be provided by the administrator.
The condition was plenty of parking spaces and a lift in the house, which basically disqualified the older development.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking the floor, high energy intensity and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old development is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern apartment.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová with her colleague Kamila Poláková from the Artiga studio.
Why did you address them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to everyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to anyone, if he designs an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of a range of possible materials and, based on the client’s wishes, are able to match the interior appropriately.
We cooperated with the architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was an obvious choice for us even during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with adequate facilities for a family of four conceived as a modern, but not a cold interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with terraces and to implement intelligent control of the household.
And, of course, it was necessary to monitor the quality of the implementation.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you interfere with the final form of the interior yourself?
All designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, were approved, but the design was always from architects.
At the beginning, we determined what we expected from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, for example, carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to navigate our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the architect's idea as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. Whether everything is tuned together, we then verified together through visualizations.
Did any complications appear during the realization, because of which you had to give up the original ideas, or, on the contrary, to accept new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we were planning actually shaded the surrounding buildings.
Back then, we literally changed the layout overnight from the ground up.
Granite was used on the kitchen counter and on the lining of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, for example, on the upholstery of the dining and bar chairs of the Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you planning any changes or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I believe that it is a modern airy interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
We are not planning changes, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the level of shielding and housing terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor, when walnut wood turns out to be too delicate for a household with a dog.
The Word of the Architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of the light pipes in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This puts the daylight in the darker areas of the apartment.
Also, the direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from the USSPA is one of the building modifications, which was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, just outside the Spanish border.
I've been moving quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which made me want to work in a magazine.
Why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere among people.
I thought every Frenchman was very negative.
People in France are negatively attuned in general, but it's gotten worse lately.
Interestingly, you mention negativity.
Some people evaluate the Czech nature in this way.
Believe me, compared to the French, you are not negative.
It may not seem like that to some people when they come to France, because they don't see it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street I lived in, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through his fingers just because I was Muslim.
Like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you've decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I have to admit that I did not know Prague at the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn’t know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch some negative reactions or swearing, but I feel like people here are freer.
That I can do anything, dress in any way, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you unpleasantly, for example, when you have special clothes and the like.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think Praguers care about such things.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then we started a website with another friend on which people offer and look for shared housing.
So far we are only operating in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends who are Czechs halfway, and two more friends of the Czechs.
I have to say that another specificity of the Czechs is that at first they keep their distance more.
He won't let someone near his body.
That's quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural issue, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in curfews or in food.
I want to learn Czech, but I don’t have that much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I don’t have that need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're Muslim?
Basically, no.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My manager, a Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense of: They are not French, but Africans.
That touched me quite a bit.
But that someone would have a problem with being a Muslim has not happened to me yet.
This is despite the fact that a colleague once warned me of some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said don't go downtown, they'll swear at me.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that anything can happen anywhere these days.
Until recently, I could not have imagined that such a thing would happen in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Islam does not recognize violence.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Quran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists shield themselves from your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, although I should not feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the violence reports, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at Jiřího z Poděbrady Square.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with the violence.
I don't think they have to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My co-workers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries, for example.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, for example, they learned Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of women.
How do you feel about it?
I don't feel subordinate to myself in any way.
Rather the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have the strength.
It also has to do with the fact that you do not wear any headgear.
For example, the hijab?
And it's mostly the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a really principled Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear the scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone how they interpret it.
When you read the Quran, you should make up your own mind about those things.
So when I read a passage in the Quran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophet’s wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where they require headscarves, I take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I feel great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
I think Prague is the ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
The yachtswoman Kozelská Fenclová wind in Rio blew on the advancing rungs.
Friday's rides at sea in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were made by Czech yachtswoman Veronica Kozelská Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to 10th place before the final two races.
This would ensure the Czech to participate in the final run.
You pick up the packages like Pokémon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea to use the already planned journey for the transport of shipments is the television director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, they breathed life into a trio of applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the national application Transfer in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this before we focus more on foreign countries, says the forty-one-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the Transfer app work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data, how much you can transport the large package and how much you want.
Someone may be in demand for transport on that day.
When the route and the time of delivery are suitable, it is paired and both of them receive mutual notification.
At that moment, the chat opens, where the pair arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register for each package to always find their courier?
I do not know the ideal state, I can not estimate how many registered and how many paths it takes to make the coverage completely optimal and each offer paired with demand.
It already works on the main routes and it is logically easier than, for example, on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
In the meantime, people are also building up trust and discovering that no one will run away with the package.
Have you not had to deal with such a case yet?
How many users have the service two months after launch?
Currently, we have about 5 to 6 thousand people who create paths.
We consider this a success and we believe that others will be packed.
Isn't there a danger that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be a competition for big conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the thing the same day and for a fraction of the price.
With a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you pay maybe a hundred or less, because that's the way someone already does business.
Should traditional carriers be worried about a potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope it will be so.
The market has huge potential, feeding on huge multinational carriers, as well as retail chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that the quality does not match what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox with a message that he should pick up the shipment at the branch, first the day after 19 o'clock.
By that time I had needed the package for six hours and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't annoy anyone and send a signal to the competition, let them try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a manager of a music club, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they began preparing the Shippansee LTD app, which uses to transport packages of already planned journeys between the world's capitals, primarily aircraft.
In 2015, they awarded a project for the processing of a company that created applications for example for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of a year and they launched the application in March 2016.
The application Transfer began to be developed in December last year and released this May.
It is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Mesík and Mesík Profi apps have been developed since January this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications that one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The sharing economy has been a topic lately, and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Are you not worried about working in an area that no one can say much about yet, where is the limit of sharing and where the grey economy is?
It's the same, just a different product.
It's clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we'll be the next thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even though someone saves and someone earns, it is not intended to bypass the tax authorities and tax controls.
Each user, either on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make income from it.
What do you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and the ferryman earns, respectively, reduces the cost of the trip.
Therein lies the strong idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the time of social networks that divide people, we would like this one to bring them closer together.
Nice stories can come out, people are happy that they have helped someone and tell each other about it.
Maybe someone can get you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
I think people have been lacking a personal approach for a long time, we say this app is a service to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package will not flee?
Each user of the application together with the registration scans the ID card and indicates the bank account, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give credibility to both the service and the person.
Couriers also collect stars based on sender ratings.
We also offer insurance, we still fine-tune the details.
The courier is liable for the uninsured consignment in the event of loss or damage, but does not assume responsibility for the content under the criminal law, if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or ten kilos of hash in his suitcase, criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
If necessary, the registered are traceable by the administrative authority, which will be the only one who will have the opportunity to consult it, nor are we ourselves able to see them, the data are protected against misuse.
How much money will a courier receive after the successful delivery of the shipment?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender is charged several percent extra for mediating contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push for volume.
No one can accuse the courier of not delivering the shipment when he actually delivered it, the receipt and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and the size of a bass of beer.
After that, there is no further restriction and if someone has a place in the car, they will transport the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier can see what he's being asked to do.
You don’t even have to pack the thing if you don’t want to hide the content.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
A friend got the idea more than two years ago, I didn't pay much attention to it back then.
Then he showed me a demo application with a transnational reach, which mainly targets passengers by plane.
At that moment, I told him that I would not look for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put savings into it.
The next year took development before we founded Shippansee LTD in London due to greater credibility of the entire product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on right now.
No, we focused on the Czech Republic, where we try to catch the application, because the whole thing had birth pains and there is still something to deal with and improve.
We try to respond to customer feedback and we do not deal with the foreign market so much at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we're not rushing, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were upgrades in a way.
I will transfer it was created when we said that the national segment can be much more interesting and that we will at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of Mesík is local, for the city.
But it can send a package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender just like I will take, but the difference is that as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
The application for couriers who want to make a living from it, we called Mesík Profi.
So someone can make a profit by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the last application in Prague will be downloaded by a taxi driver, student, mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the journey to work.
As everyone's fooling around with the Pokémon right now, they can collect this the same.
You can see where the orders are around the city, you come to it, you click and you see when it has to be delivered and you transfer the shipment.
It's set cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still doing a web interface, which will be crucial for companies to send shipments, fill in data about them on the web, so it will create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them every month to use the service.
Are you currently working on the project full-time?
It makes us busy, but we have it normally at work so that we can support the project and develop it.
There is no strong multinational investor behind us, we are two boys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other suggestions and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage not the Czech market with us, but who should, with the pardon of the ball, go with us to the global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will correct the second part and the solo game in it will be, according to the first information, more varied than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the content should be based on the concept of networking in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, includes the possibility of using a combat titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will include levels focused on skillful movement.
They will resemble platformers and include puzzles.
For example, double jumps, running on walls and rope slip are essential to overcome them.
Sometimes it will be necessary to destroy the enemies.
There will also be maps resembling mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and landslide platforms and close massive doors.
You will modify the shape of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should oscillate between fierce action and calmer moments to explore an unknown planet.
We'll play as a pawnman Jack Cooper dreaming of a career as a pilot.
Cooper, at the beginning of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimosa, crashes on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And the wilderness there will not be forbearant to him.
In addition, Lastimosa suffers fatal wounds in the crash, and Cooper is tasked with putting the captain's titan work.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot's repair.
Cooper's calls with the Titan will also be significant.
It will serve as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time robotic depersonalized communication will create humorous moments.
For example, if the titanium is dry to list all the injuries that Cooper is at risk of when he jumps.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was provided by the server Polygon.
In addition, the result can be assessed in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on 28. October, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will come to life, but the original label remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection.
In addition, another 23 games are being created for the label and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, while I was retiring, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a twenty-year-old husband, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - at first she obviously tried to do it for a long time, then they got together.
She's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to walk with the like in front of me.
She's gone completely crazy about him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had such a girlish, love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I watched the whole thing.
He went out of work regularly at half past four, so she always left at three to go shopping.
She tried every day to at least see him.
Later I found out that they were meeting in his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there.
I got my keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, in the end I always stayed at home.
I never managed to go there, to take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife thoughtfully controlled me.
I think she soon found out that I was controllable, that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I actually did.
Maybe I'm just a slipper.
At the time, my neighbors told me that they knew about it.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all cracked, it would be bad.
Only my daughter knew that it would affect everyone in the family.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But one day I went to his apartment to say that I needed help with something in the laundry.
He went with me, and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was meeting with my wife, and that he was suggesting everything.
I asked him what he was going to say.
He stood there, shrugging his shoulders, looking into the ground, and saying no word.
Then, at the time, I also met his wife once on the way out of the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it and she didn't tell me anything either.
No one told me anything then.
I'm a person who's never gone anywhere much, who's having trouble meeting someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for it all and life would go on.
But that wasn't the case.
And I've basically never dealt with all this.
I still have it in me today.
I used to show it to her quite often, but in the end I stopped for peace of mind.
He continues to live in the next house and I continue to live with her.
It's just more than my wife my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's hardworking.
I always tried to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's good.
But sometimes I'd like to pet her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together and everyone thinks about our happy marriage.
But she once told me that she never loved me.
That she loved and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I can see that he loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I'm tired of living that way.
Even when it started and I was carrying it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I was done.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought, and finally she said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
After the terrorist attacks, France is escalating the fight against radical Islamists and calls for help from the government and the local Muslim minority.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of their religion," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only the spiritual educated in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, when jihad-inoculated preachers often come up with money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It was already supposed to contribute to making financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But soon she was struck by internal contradictions, and therefore never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are about 2500 mosques and prayer rooms in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and for several other dozens, they are considering the move.
This week, German police also intervened against jihadist clerics.
The Imams allegedly recruited militants for Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where the faithful allegedly became radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015, there was a debate in France about a new institution that would replace the dysfunctional foundation.
It was all hastened by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic resources and also to oversee the imams.
However, it is not yet clear where he will get his finances, despite several proposals being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, i.e. mainly for meat derived from slaughters according to Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by sellers of halal food, namely for the provision of permission.
Some of the money would then go into the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who make their way to Mecca.
Every year, about 30 thousand of them go from France on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who have undergone educational programs at local universities should work in French mosques.
This should make their preaching in accordance with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"We have closed twenty of them since December and more will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said in a statement.
"There is no place in France for those who proclaim hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly injured by an unknown gunman on Friday morning at a shopping centre in Zaragoza, northern Spain, the Independent reports.
The shooting occurred after a woman and daughter left the garage premises in their car.
The man waited in the car outside the shopping center, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, the Independent writes.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, an ambulance had to arrive for a man in critical condition.
The act occurred around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish news agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame eyelashes, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes for light, well digestible food, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so from the summer gardens smells grilled neck, belly, pork cologne.
Nothing very healthy, not very light, sometimes with the exception of salad or toasted vegetables.
True, barbecue is economical for time and dishes, moreover, it is a social matter and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make well-treating, which will make their dining, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or stew anything.
And they will contribute to our health.
Whether it is homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-acquired griffs are enough to make the preparation fun and food itself a real exotic treat.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
There is even no more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment, and then it depends only on the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with the fillings and accessories.
There's no eyelash like eyelashes.
The advantage of a number of Asian cuisine dishes today is that ingredients are usually already available.
Including pickled sweet-sour ginger, which is one of the basic snacks accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and at the same time delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
So it is enough to buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the attachment with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed leaves of the banana tree are very widespread in many countries of Asia or South America also as a "tool" for the preparation of a variety of baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed into them similarly to foil.
The banana leaf will then also give the dish a specific flavor.
With us, they can be bought in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, choose only the leaves of deep green, and therefore healthy - uncracked and free of stains.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad from wakame algae, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought frozen again.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi will probably know the nori eyelash in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, from which it is produced by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves − i.e., plates intended precisely for the production of sushi.
Wakame − dark green algae growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido − it is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the nori algae.
By the way, who would not know miso soup with wakame, supposedly Asian women use it from time immemorial to recover after childbirth.
And this eyelash has almost miraculous effects.
It purifies the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents graying of the hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and smashed wakame also serve as a spice, for example, to flavor the rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to infuse in water, then rinse, put in boiling water and cook for half a minute.
Then it cools in the icy water, cuts out the center ribs and continues to be adjusted, for example, as a favorite salad.
However, buying it is the easiest solution.
It remains only to wrap the roll with easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a bomb of longevity.
If you resist and do not throw in an extra grilled belly.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh dish that deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done in two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of salad cucumber, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First, prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we remove it and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, in hot water, briefly simmer the asparagus shoots, after about three minutes, quickly cool them into the icy water, so that they do not lose color.
Place the vegetable filling on the allowed paper and wrap.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, which are cut into fine noodles, mix with sweet chilli sauce, add the chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on the rice paper.
Place the asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add the rolls and finally decorate the whole dish with wakame algae, pickled ginger, a slice of mango, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silverware in sevens rugby, Fiji selection takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in a seven-year-old rugby ended in a devastating lead at the last hurdle, Fiji beating the British in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio's high of 43:7.
The Fijans performed a masterful lesson in processing, landfill, evasions, support game, running on the line and brutal forces - and winning the gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unsightly consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - Britain's third on a given day - and the British could have been proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of seven-year rugby, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard-fought 7:5 win over the South Africans in the semi-final the same day, is perhaps a freeze in the final.
However, Fiji would also defeat the 15-man team in full health.
It will not be a comfort to the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the head coach of the Fijans is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
The UK has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every match in the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, reflecting the British's intrusions for joy.
For captain Tom Mitchell and the other team-mates, it was like running behind a series of buses on the move and the World Cup champions led by 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from around the corner.
The timer showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which was a conversion.
12:0 and Britain has hardly touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only slowed down the Fijans.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added more after his return, and the hours still had more than 1 minute left... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated the malaise Brits and rushed to the line where he scored.
The conversion to 29:0 was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji was born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning the passing.
That's exactly how it is.
The British made mass changes after half-time and stopped the onslaught of the Fijans... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half until after the brilliant interlude of Fiji Josu Tuisova penetrated further.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, throwing a touchdown into the left corner on raising it to 36:7. But the match was long won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely joyful approach of the Fijans.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the victory of the Fijans with another attempt.
There was a whistle, the Fijans embraced, and the British fell on the lawn completely conquered.
Even before that same day, Fiji beat Japan 20:5 in the semi-finals, and Great Britain beat South Africa in a tight semi-final - the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans into the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
The great late dump of Marcus Watson, brother Anthony of England's 15th team, secured victory - and ultimately also a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the coach's battle with cancer to win the rowing race
You won't find more emotional gold on these Games - and that's something to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing exhales into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two sitting at the oars, there were three voices in the ship. When the boat whizzed down the surface to meet the second Olympic gold in a row in the women's pairs race, the voice of the ever-present trainer Robin Williams was still with them in the boat. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying on the water surface with the elegance of swans - does not reflect the nature of victory altogether.
For every gold medal of rowing, there is a battalion of auxiliary hands, which, bit by little, make a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he would live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer, which can be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It will change your perspective.
The cancer was detected by Williams in December 2013.
The luck for the entire trio was that he could start treatment in early 2014, out of season, and thus shorten the blackout to a minimum - if we can call it that in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and walked around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the win, their first thoughts of Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, were talking less than usual, as he tried to manage his own unrest.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who has a mission in Afghanistan behind her, said: "I've been down with emotion this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
It highlights again how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin too.
Until now, it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nobody, so he deserves a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn't match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We focused at the very moment.
Helen shouted, “Don’t stop, don’t stop.”
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't want to achieve something fabulous.
We were not looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The pair take a year to think before deciding what's next.
Glover is getting married next week, with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say it was going to be my last race.
That would put too much pressure on.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling about it," she said.

Prison?
Let him drive people for free, says taximafia hunter Rubes to groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former official of the Prague City Hall are, as ČT reported, the defendants.
You've made a series of reports in which you've uncovered fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in the group that is going to stand trial.
You've faced some unpleasant skirmishes with exposed actors because of this.
How much is the report on the indictment of the members of the organized group groundbreaking for you?
I was expecting some kind of trial.
I'm especially curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail.
It's useless.
They should primarily return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by driving all people for free.
This is a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean that you do not perceive the possible punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingla, another delivers pizza, and one has completely bailed on it.
The defendants could theoretically be given two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
I have a problem with imprisonment.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the company that took it.
For a quarter of a century, they committed the fact that they were destroying our country's name and stealing from people.
So let them make a good business card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a community service.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll get a probation after all, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and subsequently at the University of Tomáš Bat'a in Zlín.
He is one of the people who started with viral videos and videos for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programmes, now he is preparing the Prague Guide program, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, Rubeš advises which services to avoid in Prague and which he recommends to use without fear.
Previously he filmed a series with the titles How to Do, City of Deceptions?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
In the indictment, they are referred to as an organized group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from The Godfather.
They are more about mobsters - juniors, but organized are definitely.
Just in the fact that they guard each other's stepladders (taxi stations).
Prague is all divided.
I have traced that, for example, the main railway station does not like to be with Pařížská, Pařížská does not like to be with taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everyone just keeps their place and every group is organized.
It's probably a convoluted network.
But the defendants are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate official who warned the driver against checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomena have not disappeared from the streets.
What percentage of Prague fraudsters in the taxi service, according to your estimate, is?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst on the street are still.
I'm talking about Aleš Ryjáček, for example.
This is a person who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by the Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I went with him, he asked me for seven hundred in three kilometers.
His police have not detained him for some reason.
Only a few people from the whole big group were selected.
However, the situation is the same in other locations in Prague.
The prosecution of seven people is therefore difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague insouciance, which apparently has much larger dimensions.
Of course, it's no use.
It will help, but all evil will not be eradicated, that is true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still stand out in the same places that you showed in the reports, i.e. at the Charles Bridge or in Pařížská Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day and violate ordinances every day.
This is ignored by both the city police and the Prague City Hall.
It's not even a cat anymore, but a complete indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Still, some of them, even if it's just part of the group, get on trial.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfaction?
If I took it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel like it needs to be a little better, I will continue to do so.
You have to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But it is not, of course there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them in taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught a taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was an amount of 56 crowns (he used a trick with a decimal point).
He had a receipt for it, the police arrived and this taxi driver was so cutely cheeky that he was still going to see those policemen and asking them when someone would finally give him those 56 crowns.
Similar case.
A taxi driver on a taximeter taped a decimal point and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the insolence of fraudulent taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed the faces of those who charged meaningless sums for a short ride in your shots?
Their insolence is still incredible.
How did the 56 crowns taxi driver go?
Police sent him away, saying they could not discuss with him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem in that court (six taxi drivers and one ex-official).
On the one hand, there will be a taxi driver with his receipts, on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate must not use secret recordings from a taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming the episodes about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves pointed me out to this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage in the story.
Are you worried that this could protect them from trial?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not make a living from it.
You talked about a trick with a decimal point, which especially in front of foreign clients underwater taxi drivers move.
Is it still up to date, or are they worried about continuing to use this trick after your reports are published?
I think we've popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
I was driving with a taxi driver the other day, boasting in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that from the side of the taximeter glued black cardboard.
When I asked him what he had there, he said to me, "You know what it is."
When the taxi driver-con offenders did not work very well, can the court and their colleagues warn them?
Is there anything that can deter them from fraud?
You've always talked about finding a way to cheat.
I think nothing can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And those are fair taxi drivers who should fight more to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately predominant.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack skill.
He doesn't know how to walk in it much and can't say exactly what they want.
When they held the demonstration (due to a proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it did not sound very clear what they actually wanted.
They once said they didn't protest against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they only blocked Prague and it became only the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you evaluate the approach of the Prague City Hall in solving the problem of overpriced fares?
It can be seen that the criminal police had to step in to sort something out.
The magistrate was short for it.
They had a mole that was leaking information, that is, the taxi department did its job for several years in vain.
I hope that the official will charge all the thwarted checks until the last check to realize what he has done.
That's what I think the worst of it.
I was even on a control ride with him, which I found out afterwards from their schedule.
It has been several months since the release of the latest episodes of the series.
What's the response?
I think especially of foreign audiences, rather than the series is the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play them videos.
And when we go around the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people who are seen in the footage are really standing there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put a fence around them so people would look at them.
The Museum of Communism on the Street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need to?
Right. Yeah.
I run services that I do not have to pay in cash, but by card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatches that are fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Well, you have the courage."
Bem in disguise as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were reported in 2005.
The former mayor Pavel Bém set off for a control ride dressed as an Italian tourist in the same year and on the first attempt the driver cheated him by two hundred.
The editor of Rubeš had a worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for driving from Old Town Square to Wenceslas Square, which is about 195 crowns per kilometre, as the report's creators calculated.
The Prague Municipality has set the maximum price at 28 crowns per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the filmed report: for example, the two-kilometre road from Pařížská street to Truhlářská cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
They charge six hundred crowns for a ride on Anděl, which has 2.5 kilometers.
The marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
The impurities of it go well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be extracted from the folds.
It is not easy and it is not going fast, the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in Háje approached her work.
Hats off to it: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb and climb down again countless times.
"The restorer should be careful, patient and unpretentious to the work environment," she said.
In Frýdlant, this is far from the first of her restoration work.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the rear tract of the Frýdlant Town Hall were restored, the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Piet in Frýdlantská Okružní Street, the Marian Column in Frýdlant or the Atlantics in the facade of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrk.
The restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Kryštof and Kateřina from Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned of the deposition of dirt, and the crust, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and displacement; either they will anchor themselves to the wall or to each other.
They are also expected to treat and preserve the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold-plated again.
"Then it will begin with the gilding of the inscriptions on the marble slabs with pure sliced gold," said Věra Sobotová, an official of the State Heritage Care of the Municipal Authority in Frýdlant.
There are no records from the past that the tombstone has undergone any repairs.
On closer inspection, the holes, drilled in marble columns, take a closer look.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of the decoration of the tombstone.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the raid of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
They literally combed the tombstone, Sobotová said.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross, the restorers are at home with a slight exaggeration.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombstones that found themselves underwater, the baptismal house, the murals in the tomb and now the tombstone were restored.
"We would also like to go on stained glass in the future," Sobotova revealed.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
The restoration work on the restoration of the Redernov tombstone will come to a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be paid for by subsidies, the city will not deposit any of its money into this part of the restoration.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from winning the regional round of the Historical City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The council decided to release the prize for the restoration of the tombstone.
Opinions of experts on future developments on selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in the horizon of one month and a half of the year.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500, which went through a 12% correction in February, is now at a new historic high and has already gained 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interest of central banks in the long run, which have always achieved theirs.
In a situation where U.S. stocks are at a historic high, the volatility that is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets grew contentedly and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the U.S. central bank and when, like today, the volatility index (VIX) held steady below the 12 percent threshold.
And not to either.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in both Europe and Japan is in full swing, and in the past week the Bank of England has also put its hand to the work, which will buy 70 billion pound bonds in the coming six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing is pushing already low yields even lower and contributing to the near-complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That, of course, is a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and in China is stabilizing, and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we probably should not be too surprised if U.S. stocks continue to hold on in a similarly calm regime.
Too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has taken on this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, said the head of the European Commission, Juncker, when he appointed the French politician (truly experienced, because he had experienced so many different transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to find) was appointed the main negotiator of the European Commission on the terms of the UK's exit from the EU.
Juncker's selection has blown out hints of hopes that it is in the EU's grave interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most of the British media adopted the name Barnier as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a rocky European federalist.
He hates the UK.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014) he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He conceived it in a way that only he could have conceived it: the hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon conception of the free market and the model of capitalism.
The advocate of multilateral regulations was co-authored by the concept of the so-called banking union, and with a grudge against everything that comes from the City Financial Centre in London, he pushed through the legislation of exorbitantly harsh regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, a representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, adamant and apparently even ruthless negotiator.
That's probably not good news.
How not to remember in this context the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance sheet, overview and ability of the empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
Today, Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies.
Too bad Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this one -.
It would be for everyone's good!
The earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin's ruler dismissed his loved one Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
This was reported by Russian media, citing the announcement of the Kremlin press service.
Putin has indicated that Ivanov is dismissing at his own request.
In a meeting carried by the Rossiya 24 television station, the president said he was following Ivanov's wish when he took office that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The news of the exchange at the head of the president's administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current deputy Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is considered one of Putin’s closest associates.
This former KGB officer has previously held the posts of Defence Minister and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now also leave the chair of a member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov said in a meeting with Putin that he was actually a record holder for the length of remaining at the head of the administration of the head of state.
He lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already replaced themselves in this position.
Neither Kvitova nor the doubles players Strýcová and Šafářová will play the finals.
So far, none of Friday's tennis matches have managed to turn into a final turnout.
Petra Kvitova was the first to lose her fight, succumbing to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puigová after sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, the Czech doubles player Šafářová and Strýcová followed Kvitová.
The Williams sisters' slayers reached for a win in the first set, but squandered two sets and the Russians eventually captured the set in a shortened game.
The second set then lost by a ratio of 4:6.
The Czech rowing scored half the success rate in the morning program in Rio: skier Ondřej Synek won his semi-final with an overview, when he beat the second Damir Martin from Croatia despite a slowdown in the end by almost a second.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, Synek said.
Unlike him, his opponents had to fight for progress.
So it took away some strength from them, that could make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the Prague Dukla rower.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not follow in Snyk's footsteps.
The thirty-five-year-old rower took fourth position in today's semi-final in her ride and on Saturday she will start in the B final and fight for 7 to 12th place.
The gold from London will not be defended.
I didn't make it to the finals for the first time at the Olympics.
I'm a little bit sorry, but on the other hand I was riding a quality race and I put everything I could into it.
The opponents were simply better, Topinková Knapková bent down in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed she would make it to her fourth Games among the elite six.
She gave up the fight just before the finish.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could get out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could advance to the final through the Austrian.
Unfortunately, today was a life-long race, said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained the young scorer Filip Nepejchal, who failed to break out of qualifying for the second time, this time small-shooters in the lie.
In it, Nepejchal took 33rd place.
The qualification was best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky advanced from the first place with 629 points, from the second by Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepejchal's shot was worth 620.5 points.
The athletes, including Czech seven-fighters Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová, also spoke for the first time in Rio.
Cachová ranks 11th after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is twenty-two.
She is led by British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimetres just like second-ranked Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both took care of the best ever high-altitude performance in the seven-fight.
They tried to jump 201 centimetres more, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Apart from the absurdity of the question thus asked: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, while the Russian has not.
In the two great Eurasian nations, dictators occurred in the 20th century, and regimes came to power that were inhuman, brutal and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism, which is presented in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanely exterminated about 6 million Jews, and the total victims of the Second World War are estimated at 60 million.
In the occupied or deserted territories, the Germans and Soviets carried out the atrocities.
In Germany and the USSR, not only a few individuals were to blame, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, either actively, passively or just by cowardice or sticking its head in the sand.
This is not the specifics of these peoples alone, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the end of the war immediately came the denazification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: Daddy, Grandfather, why did you participate in such atrocities?
How could you do that!
This brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites took care mainly of the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naïve idealistic) goals, but it is certainly not a question of joining back Alsace-Lorraine or anyone - to the revanch - to attack - militaryly - perhaps everyone will recognize it.
After the loss of the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes finally closed at the turn of the millennium when a former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin's Russia is the revanch, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and future of their own people is of no value to the world.
Beat yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from the rise of tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
Who is benefiting from the rise in tension?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side became the peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, the news from both sides contradicts itself and it is difficult to independently verify, so do we have the opportunity to think only of the old known question of who benefits from it?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
A well-known response came from the case of the pilot Savchenko that they were allegedly kidnapped on the territory of Russia.
If we accept the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further toughening sanctions and intensifying the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, the backdrop of the immigration crisis to Europe has been a retreat from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost completely credit in front of its residents, when the current support of President Poroshenko is around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have gone bankrupt long ago had it not been for generous financial injections by the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention to its country again in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces again want to prove themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
We can only hope that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both sides and stop their hostilities in time.
Bulgaria reports inflation for first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12-month period (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the travels of the following consumer goods groups in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices have fallen for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained.
The U.S. intelligence agencies have been tracking Russian hacking for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was dealing with an attack on the servers of the party's headquarters of the Democrats.
However, there is no mention of the Russian involvement in the attack.
Moscow has denied involvement in the attack.
The report of the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because its disclosure would reveal that the U.S. intelligence agencies are monitoring the hacking and could be exposed the way they do it and what sources they are using.
Two Russian intelligence agencies were said to have participated in the attack.
The New Cyber Security Advisory Council
The material about tracking the Russian track was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight leading congressional MPs, called the gang of eight in the U.S., have been informed.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, Democrats in both chambers Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the congressional and security committees.
The acting head of the Democratic Party, Donna Brazile, said on Thursday she was creating a cybersecurity advisory council to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of the Democratic Party's servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon of Albert.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's complaint for health problems after eating food Salmon wild smoked - pieces 100 g, expiration date 22.11.2016 Prague hygiene inspections in Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Můstu.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out, is no longer available, and therefore the product was taken the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
The laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a powerful allergen and human-saved live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Šticha said.
We are very sorry for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from the sale and, for preventive reasons, we also downloaded all other batches of this item.
The misconduct occurred on the part of the supplier we are dealing with and at the same time we have had this product tested ourselves, spokeswoman Alberta Barbora Vanko told the News.
If the customer has purchased this product, he can return it in any of the chain's stores and receive the money back.
The larvae will be destroyed by frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vrňata.
The Prague and Central Bohemian veterinary administrations reported on the occurrence of the dangerous product.
According to the server bezpecnostpootravin.cz, people after ingesting the parasite can get anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can occur symptom-free, the Czech News Agency said.
Symptoms appear an hour to two weeks after consumption of insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the beginning of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Both adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either with sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or when frozen.
Veterinarians have also checked salmon for the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had a parasite in them.
The shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Expanded, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain, has been 919 packs to date.
At present, the withdrawal of unsold stocks of the product from stores is underway, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal told the Czech Press Agency on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately banned sending other products from the warehouse immediately after finding positive samples.
Seventeen-year-old British woman wanted to flee Raqqa, killed by Russian airstrike.
After the initial enthusiasm and swift marriage to the jihadist, who was soon killed, came sobering up.
The anticipated paradise of the caliphate has turned into a hell on earth for British girls, from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister, Halima, according to relatives.
She has repeatedly made phone calls to Britain and confided that she wanted to go back home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without thinking, The Telegraph quotes the family's lawyer, Tasnim Akunjee.
The last clues led to Raqqa, from there the girl called for the last time.
Then came the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in east London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could flee because the house she was staying in leveled with the airstrike in May, Britain's ITV News reported.
The TV added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that was attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You would withstand blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week that (Kadiza) was thinking about fleeing the territory of the Islamic State, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think she interpreted it (Kadiza) as a warning and decided not to take any chances, according to the BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abasova, embarked on a journey of 17. February of last year.
All they said at home was that they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey to IS-controlled territory.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in her power to get Kadiza back.
You could take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could, tensing all the forces to get your daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive, according to him, is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent to other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, realized how things were going, understood how far it was different from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiza's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also paused, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to prison without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the regional centre and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, the town hall held courts and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts dwelt were pitiful and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them successfully.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the premises of the prison to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
It was not in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, because smaller correctional facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Stories of convicts and ghost hunts.
The prison opened to the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with a new one to convince themselves how different the conditions prevailed in them.
Guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment they applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked in one of the cells, mostly because of a photo in memory, or to induce the feeling experienced behind bars by prisoners.
In addition, Inveraray prison is one of Scotland's most famous locations where it is reportedly haunted.
Several groups of paranormal activity hunters have already gone there, and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
Such a night, however, comes out to 300 pounds, which is in the amount of about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
The “animé” effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animé, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality every day and toy with the identity of ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a character who seems to have stepped out of a picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any error will be posted immediately.
Snapchat filters have earned criticism in the past, alleging that the app promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin tones as an ideal beauty.
So when this week she offered users a filter that made them slanted eyes, twisted teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated contentious issues were not pointing to the greater problem of society - the diversity problem.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and outrage spread quickly, and Snapchat said the very next day that it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of the account to the characters of the anime, not as a caricature of the Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded the painful stereotypes in action.
Others, without a cover comparison with the anime, refused.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that "it is difficult to argue against the comparison of the obvious Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is drawn to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only society that has exceeded those cultural limits.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from boardrooms in corporations to Holywood and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that’s offensive to a user,” twenty-five-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, “it’s very hard to do these things today unnoticed, like they used to.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in an interview over the phone, she said she was convinced that racially motivated issues reflected a lack of diversity in recruiting workers at Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the overwhelming white, completely male management of the company, and the article ended with a hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they have no diversity and color among the employees the moment these things are decided,” said Zhu, who has a Chinese-American origin, “or that’s where colored people work, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to talk.”
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees, saying it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to talk about the racial origins of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently recruited a recruiter who should focus on the underrepresented population and internal management of inclusion.
Zhu added: "I'm curious if they really need other such users who can say it's not okay," with the fact that their account will remain cancelled.
Army officers misrepresent intelligence on IS, parliamentary committee says
The parliamentary committee said in a report issued Thursday that officers from the U.S. Central Command were changing intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events from the country provided.
According to a preliminary report by a task force compiled by the Republican chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, "extensive dissatisfaction" among Central Intelligence Agency analysts was found, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of U.S. efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is the Army Central in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The statement said: "The intelligence intelligence outputs approved by Centcom's superior officers usually offered a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorist efforts than those confirmed by the facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community."
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are harmed when a flawed analysis is presented to the superior policymakers," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
The failure in the leadership of Centcom reaches to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the persistent problems of the Central Staff in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts in training Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While no decisive evidence is offered that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be altered, the report said analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases of the Central Staff, statements and testimony from the Congress were substantially more positive than what the events actually were," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," Assemblyman Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican Party representative, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking U.S. Central Staff Intelligence Staff manipulated the outputs of the staff's intelligence services to downplay the dangers of IS in Iraq.
Republicans have assembled a task force after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence information related to Islamic State is being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, must be followed by a more detailed investigation.
There is yet another investigation under way in the Centcom intelligence services, led by the Department of Defense's inspector general.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which matched some of the Republicans' working group conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created a very narrow process for compiling an assessment of IS and Iraqi security forces," Representative Adam B said in a statement. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Deputy Democrats.
In Adam Schiff's words, the process "led to a distortion of intelligence output," damaging morale among analysts and "lacking up adequately taking into account dissenting views."
However, Schiff and Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to a "model or political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon inspector general, which was launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report because the inspector general's investigation is still ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a sound dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security."
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now declaring a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year's accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can count on the central staff to sincerely evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
Criticism of the news about the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper that President George W. Bush's administration. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the resistance against Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group's resources because the group had built temporary refineries and oil was selling on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been handed over outside the central staff.
Centcom Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism last year after many lawmakers found testimony to the Senate overly positive assessments of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by a gene at Centcom. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. has won in field hockey in its fourth game in a row, so today will be played a decisive match in the UK team
Katie Bam scored three goals in the match against Japan, which ended with a 6:1 victory, and just a day after that for the U.S. women's field hockey team, she scored the first two goals of the match, in which America beat India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five wickets in two games is a success worth remembering, but Bam (27) said she wasn't sure if she'd ever managed to do something like that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who write down their wickets.
But this is what he knows: the Americans in the Olympic tournament lead to 4:0 matches and share the first place in the group with the UK, which remained unbeaten on Thursday after Japan's 2:0 defeat.
The UK and the United States will face each other on Saturday in the last match of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide which of the group of six teams will finish first and who in second place.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the head of the second group.
Whatever the end of Saturday's match, the Americans caused a stir here with their surprise ride, four years after finishing among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took the hockey stick for field hockey for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
The 2008 Olympics escaped her because she didn't make it to the final roster.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team did very well.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Ms. Bam said.
We didn't have the work rate we have in London as we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half by scoring a goal with a backend from close range.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took the opportunity.
She escaped down the left side of the playing field, then curled into the middle and scored the ball into the goal to get the Americans into the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who helped to one goal in each of the three wins, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is, that will depend on the outcome of Saturday's match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic rampage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, there is a sense of persistent, indescribable and intrigued alternation of competition and effort.
It's how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay pin being handed over from a chandelier by a swimmer, a gymnast and a triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspapers or listen to your neighbor's interview in the queue at the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad Le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimples on her faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be heard in homes in prime time between advertising and sponsor spots if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in jumps on a trampoline.
The Olympic flame doesn't shine the same for all competitions.
Away from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not universally recognized: shooting from air guns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw my attention to the inconspicuous magic of the trampoline.
Although the jumps on the trampoline have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first shown at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, the sport remains almost unnoticed - many of the people I questioned didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a medal in a trampoline jump and until 2012 none of the athletes made it to the finals.
Prices in the men's category are usually divided between China and Russia, and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, gold medals from London will be embraced by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada.
But the jumps on the trampoline are even more unlucky, partly because the uninitiated ear will seem more suited to the Klaun University than to the Olympics.
I have to confess that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the country.
It has comic potential - the comics vibrations of endless reflection - but also the gracefulness of gymnastics and diving, two sports it combines.
The word “trampoline” is derived from the Spanish “el trampoline” meaning “ski jumping plate.”
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of up to almost 10 meters and shows off line-ups with several elements (salta, screws and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to the execution, difficulty and "time in the air."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
The fighters of the gold medals have to go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
It tries to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall, but, as the TV news releases, also another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a little exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on a trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she is reflected as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, the difficulty is not possible, but for the duration of the assembly there is no fierce fight for the achievement of the goal, no distance measurement, but only perfect, graceful springing of time and gravity.
This is just the closest the Olympics and the women are getting closer.
The qualification and finals of the women take place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock in Eastern time, the men's competition then on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of the afternoon block, which begins for both days at 2 p.m.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment, which you will probably miss through the other fights.
And if attention is to be achieved only by making male athletes the subject of love-filled gazes and materialization - as the U.S. gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is merely waiting for his new fans, who are gasping for breath.
'Protesting generation' in Ethiopia, longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot during clashes with police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
But over the past few months, anti-government unrest has engulfed the country, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses say officers shot and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
On the circulating videotapes of the protests, which probably date back to the end of last year or earlier this year, members of the security forces are captured beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand by the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now demanding a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and taking a step forward will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa’s head of research for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the dangers of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few of the African countries, if any, are receiving such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has evolved at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved fundamentally - there is even a new suburban train running in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - human rights groups speak of government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
However, this can change.
"When you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
It protests all the youth.
A whole generation is protesting.
There are many complaints and they relate to everything from land disputes to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's elections, which were widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now control 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, pressure is mounting on the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this inaccurately marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
The Anylitics fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past years, such as the Orom Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of smoldering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have flared up again.
The first is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks for up to the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly the case especially during protests, many people can still communicate through an Internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians have spoken out about how they have gathered for protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between the Oroms and the Amhars, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroma and the Amhars are not natural allies.
For the long days, the Amhars, mainly from the Christian hills of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade and used the Oroms, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on the road to a unified leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests occurred in areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 when he succumbed to an unidentified illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly masterful in detecting initial signals of dissatisfaction and using envoys to process and get opponents on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been pulled out of relative ignorance to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in Tigrean-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be a further shedding of blood.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such riots was in 2005 after thousands of people protested what analysts called an election that the government had collosed and then stole.
A harsh crackdown followed, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in recent months - and this period of riots passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped it.
And there is dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amhar city of Gondar attacked business firms owned by the Tigreans and a grudge against Tigreans on social media became increasingly common.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flyovers over neighboring Somalia, although it recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West wants to support democracy unequivocally, it does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile region.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to downplay the latest controversy that is flooding his campaign, by saying he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to speak clearly with the American public.
He also puts his proponents in an awkward position, who defended him in a tumultuous time and must explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
After that motion at a meeting Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he did not really intend to say that the president and H. Clinton created ISIS.
But in a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the claim of the old just one day when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's remark ease by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy IS, the Republican presidential candidate did not respond.
The latest storm comes as Trump has attempted to focus his campaign's attention on the economy while his preference in pre-election polls declines.
Trump and Clinton participated in a duel in Michigan this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, and said her speech was boring, according to him.
Trump has used defenses with sarcasm before.
In late July, when he reaped a wave of criticism when he came forward with a suggestion that Russians should break into Clinton's emails, he later explained his remark by saying, "I'm sarcastic of course."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and moderate them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing the extent to which some reports have a response from his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction, he then ‘gives an explanation in one way or another’,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that he is skillful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained in different ways.
As the results of the pre-election polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more sly tone in recent days, instead of moderating things for general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed that Tump is with great distance behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very closely behind her in Florida.
Trump is even trying to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he says, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump's increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes put in an awkward situation his devoted supporters, who must publicly stand behind him, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe that what he is saying is a legitimate political commentary," Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that he completely mistakenly called a newcomer. And it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed IS to boom and fail to handle the Middle East situation aggressively.
Ahead of Friday's Pennsylvania rally, Trump continued to rain a fire around himself on the media for pondering his every word and being biased against him.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” television scholars who were trying to understand him, and said, “They can’t do that!”
Several Democrats have sneered at Trump's apology, saying it's just further evidence that he's not eligible for the presidency.
Prices pushed the cafe out of the market. He's back at Greenpoint
The cafe Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee was served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is plundered and from Verb the deal is now soap."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original coffee shop, who is also the owner and chief executive of the new post.
He started in Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same pastry supplier and bought the same model of the espresso machine.
He even reused the lighting from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The menu includes ham, egg and cheese sandwiches, and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You will also find bowls of brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original regulars.
“A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Ms. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to the Verb Cafe often.
She even went then when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said when Verb closed, she completely stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day she had mixed chai instead of her usual iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been devoted to going to Verb since 2003.
He goes before work and always orders the same thing.
“At quarter and eight I come here every day, like a clock, and they are already preparing my bun for me with everything and butter,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually orders, but occasionally he puts bacon, eggs and ham on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he was not sorry that the soap shop had taken his old place.
The truth is that Soap Cherie owners have offered to make special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
Also, the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have received the cafe well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it soon, so that his new neighbors would feel at home here.
The new place has other advantages.
A local fruit juice producer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
It offers the possibility for the cafe to spread to a neighboring building.
It is enough for many customers to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe reopens, to enter and have a coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressed food from the time of the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
President Roosevelt enjoyed selected dishes from the 5th Avenue, such as goose-yie pâté and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for this day was more modest: eggs in the devilish way in tomato sauce, potato puree and, as a dessert, plum pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans on how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane, in her book "97 Orchard," tells the life story of a residential home on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal," which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed cooking solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small austere buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had a turkey, a potato porridge and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which, according to the couple, was excellently suited to talking about food during the crisis.
“Markets were very popular,” said Miss Ziegelman.
It sold peanut, liver and bean meatball.
They were made from that admixture and other cheap food that set the ingredient.
Read the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grinned.
"They'd be lying in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of eating what you eat.
Women's teams cooked for farm workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner, freshly baked cake was served.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. “A Square Meal” observes the ways in which the nation coped with the fact that suddenly it was not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, dreaded point for the American people," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: mysterious meals spread, like meatballs and dishes from saucepans, casseroles as "an amazing way to use scraps," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unaesthetic ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat - for years the focal point of American food - has become an austerity-assigned luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were supposed to serve as a calorie and nutritional filling, took precedence over taste or even common sense in cooking.
During the surveys for the book, which contains recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period meal of roasted onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter with roasted onions does not go together.
It was typical of a lot of homemade recipes.
Like never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the sher of the federal office for the domestic economy from 1923 to 1943 - managed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over the reins of the budget, and snoops, such as creamy spaghetti with carrots, turned into delicious meals.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical treats.
Above all, the desserts came about in the government’s response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s pose of “I’ll have a cake.”
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farming kitchen of his childhood, he dined as the chosen millionaire he became.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He was eating in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not prompted him to lead by example with his own stomach.
As the book tells, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all. This led to the White House "not only serving almost the most grim food in all of Washington, but also in the most dismal way prepared."
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis subsided as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
The reference remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, Ms. Ziegelman says, and in the way science applies itself to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they better understood Miss Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - for example, why she couldn't throw away food.
"She was really scared of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman said, “The people were sick of it.”
There was an accident with wreaths.
When there were clean tables at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly buried a spoon in the thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a good householder, he said to his wife, “A little chopped walnuts would be useful.”
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees who flock to Europe come for economic reasons.
The young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what the shows would look like if we did them.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us make fun of their home country.
Using a photoshop, he creates collages that humorously show what it would look like if famous series and movies were filmed in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the cost of legal representation in the patent case against hepatitis C against the Merck Group
The District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of attorneys' fees incurred by it in the trial on the C-type jaundice patent against drugmaker Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the ruling was overturned under which Gilead was supposed to pay 200 million for damages for infringing Merck's two patents in connection with Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni's very successful drugs, after a federal judge found repeatedly illegal conduct on the part of Merck, among other things, a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in the file Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a waiver of fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for next-generation hepatitis C drugs, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
The American-backed military units say they have gained full control of the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed military forces have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after Islamic State's last fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city.
The troops have freed over 2,000 civilians who were detained by militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF Alliance and the Manbide Military Council told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it,” he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax return, which says the Democrat presidential candidate and her husband had revenue of $10.75 million in that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
The Clintons donated $1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed nearly a $5.3 million fee to the joint box for lectures, and the former secretary of state admitted an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
The Clinton co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of the State of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, have published tax returns in 10 years.
Those in 2015 paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign, said in a statement.
Against this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backs away from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not oblige them to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit of the U.S. Treasury Department's tax department as a reason for his refusal to release tax returns.
"Your move," Hillary Clinton's campaign aide said on Twitter, following up on the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special Trump adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release tax returns until the audits are over.
According to Trump critics, among whom is Republican presidential candidate from 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, his rejection raises questions about his net profits, contributions to charity, business transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton speaks strongly on the issue, posting a video on Friday in which she recalls how high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, the question was mentioned in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates for the presidency have been doing for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said in front of the people.
The Politico organization said Trump has paid no or very low taxes over the past two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times publicist has quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim, this may be the case even today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of a president.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that all those who earn more than $1 million in a year pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffett, at a rally of Clinton in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also passed the IRS audit and that Trump is "not afraid" of the tax office but voters.
The Clinton campaign released tax returns retroactively until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid a federal tax of an average of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, they're just 100 dollars in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported income on dividends and interest rates of 109,000 dollars.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to human dwellings - throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
This procedure has proven itself, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this procedure and trains volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania, how to use this non-violent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they were developed by this... set of tools, we have seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them," Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation, said in a statement.
The first and second step is to light the flashlight on the passing elephant and lower the horn.
If it does not deter it, it will be thrown away by the so-called "chilli cloud".
Chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped in a condom together with the firecracker, its end is knotted so that only the wick looks out of it.
After launching, the condom explodes and a fine chilli powder is scattered into the air.
Usually one whiff is enough and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to detonate the fireworks, which will trigger a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned into a Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling Israel to the Arabs' "request" - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the employee, based on the "request" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in a list of codes for calling at the hotel.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Hotel Kempinski Bristol offers the option of calling Israel via its own call centre.
The director sought an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with the problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, in his words, "shocked."
The hotel worker replied that the measure was "decided after the consideration of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this move further annoyed the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the call code of Israel be cleared," Lanzmann quoted the staff as saying in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a great embarrassment."
We were horrified and shocked by the events.
In itself, it's a huge embarrassment.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is even more disgraceful.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event provoked a strong reaction online, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel has simply "lost itself" in the demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," reads another post, which points out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street, is near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel newspaper, the hotel itself quickly dropped any accusations by calling the event "overlooking" and "apologizing" to Lanzman.
“A direct order has never been issued” not to include Israel in the list of codes for calls, the Suddeutsche Zeitung representative of the Kempinski Hotel quotes.
It adds that the code for calling has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
A clash of students and police occurred in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, when students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government riot services tried to disperse the students, which ended with police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of San Paulo State Governor Gerald Alckmin in order to save money is also the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300 000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could be seen spraying signs on the wall against interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country's Senate decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran rises 71% - RT Business
According to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover rose 70.9 percent year-on-year after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian firms that do business in the country.
Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015, reaching $856 million.
Specifically, Russia's exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent, reaching $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jump in trade was ensured by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued about 35 000 visas to Iran's citizens, mostly travel.
In addition, Iran has for the first time been among the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It can be said that the record number of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be surpassed.”
At the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes there will be a change.
"Personally, I can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Callum Skinner cattle rush home after Britons win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome when the VB team's trio defended the title from London 2012.
The twenty-three-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the brake he took for his Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and the youngster delighted the legend as he rushed to the finish and stole the victory from the hands of the favoured New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the World Championships in track cycling in March, although Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for specialist opening racer Jamie Staff.
Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoya's departure, a place was also vacant, which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was along with Hoy's champion four years ago - and with Skinner achieved the Olympic record at qualifying, but the jersey took over New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his round, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes going to a higher gear to slow down and allowing Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes ascended the stage, he did not take his eyes off them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a Glasgow native, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on track after a weak start.
He later withdrew the remark and Britain's rivals had no choice but to appeal.
This time there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said: "With all the British flags in the stands, I felt like I was in London."
We've all come together as a team in the last three months.
We've lost in a lot of world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then a successful five days are waiting for us at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny showed, it's not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
This would then be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy's day, also has a birthday on March 23 (this date seems sacred to British sport, on this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
The same, how much did Hoy get.
Next, Kenny will participate in the sprint, which begins today and will last another three days.
The twenty-eight-year-old native of Bolton said: "I'm enjoying this one now.
The team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for itself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
That was the only medal race of the day, but Britain was expecting even more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the team's four-kilometer pursuit race.
They ended with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first lap and finals (22:42) are held on the second day of the race, which will surely be targeted by Wiggins.
He debated with the commissioners yesterday before the qualifying race when the referees called on him to measure the height.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie have achieved a world record with a time of 4:13.2.60.
Team VB relied on its strong team of track cycling and dominated the middle season of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After really exceptional performances, proving total superiority in Beijing and London, she dropped expectations during preparations for Rio.
In the background, dramatic events unfolded, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the careers of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of races at the velodrome, the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver a top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of melting plant in Portland after termination of power supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies the company with electricity and that has informed the intention of one of the owners of the melting plant to terminate the electricity supply contract. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
The move comes after the Victoria State government decided earlier this year not to extend the provision of subsidies that keep the business running.
A fixed twenty-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa Portland.
When closed, up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk.
And because the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generated in Victoria, there may be other avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelting plant in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
The Alcoa smelt in Portland is a losing day and is in danger of being shut down.
The move follows several years of speculation about the future of the business, originally in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently because of race production prices.
AGL, which supplies large aluminum melting plants with electricity from the Loy Yang A plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expected that any of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, while China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp hold small business shares.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue,” she said.
AGL said the treaties were so-called "reinsurance contracts" that were due to come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so their validity will actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to anticipate that the contracts will account for the profits for fiscal year 2017,” the plant said.
Any potential impact on AGL profits from fiscal 2018 onwards is currently limited due to the strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written the value of the contracts under its $187 million ledgers "in case the termination occurs."
Alcoa said the contract's decision to terminate "does not have an impact on its ... the ability to operate a melting plant or secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant."
The U.S. company said it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that was due to begin in effect from November this year, although it still has to explain why it backed down from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious when it comes to the possible closure of the Portland melthouse in Victoria as well as the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL chief executive, Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumed about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts a year.
If both of these undertakings were withdrawn from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in market demand.
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian's real estate TV show - now it's the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), a model and the fourth daughter of mother-manager of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the front page of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, an ambassador for the Estee Lauder brand, who performed at fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page," Kendall wrote.
The revealing of the front page followed a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the humoresque by the Kardashians?) staged video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar rioters Rob and Caitly and, along with them all, a favorite uncle from show business, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest). They forgot about their sister's cover just so the scene could end in a classic turn: they're preparing a secret party.
It’s the storyline of almost every “birthday” episode of a children’s TV show (Seacrest says: “Did you think we forgot about you?” with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure that the other girls could make a living on this publicity.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we certainly entered a new era of the Kardashians.
Kim's older sister may have pushed Kendall into the cover of Vogue (she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the magazine's September issue is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The release, which resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist calculated that of the 832 pages in last year's edition, 615 pages were with advertising content).
The unveiling of the star, which will appear on the front page, is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the magazine's images have been leaked before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, more of the “celebrities that models do” than “models that are celebrities” have appeared on the front page.
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar winner and Dior ambassador, appeared on the headline in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Laga Gaga.
But while it is highly unlikely that Kendall - which the magazine describes as a "breakthrough model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people, not even the stars of real estate shows, or the kids of today who know how to make a well-eded video (although Jenner introduces all of this).
They are proven talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model in June, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the whores of the moment."
These feelings flared up again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
He's showing off for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you a makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you self-shots on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of daughter Cindy Crawford, who she shot for LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she performs on a reality show, perhaps just one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Community legal aid centres reject 160 000 people a year
More than 160 000 most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in the community centres of legal aid, and in the sector itself they are preparing for impacts that will have further restrictions on funds for already extremely busy services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, at-risk workers, victims of violence and people without funds to fight unfair evictions and the like - are being rejected as early as seeking free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, which are already tense to bursting, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, those legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal finance.
James Farrell, director of Queenslade's community legal aid centers, said that according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers, five thousand people have been found to be rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without overturning the federal government's decision, the situation would deteriorate.
"Community legal aid centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with the rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leading to thousands more people at risk from Queensland having to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We call on State Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately prevent this shortening of finances from getting people the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government of the state has lived up to its commitment to secure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of the community centres of legal aid and the communities of their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after a member of staff allegedly pointed a gun
New York: A lawsuit has been filed against Donald Trump's campaign for alleged inaction after they were told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February pointed a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep.
The incident was described in a court file handed over Wednesday in the state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer of the campaign in the state.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to resolve itself internally before concluding that "it will not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "indicated a pistol with his fingers, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the barrel at Vincent's head," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini, after a complaint with the local and regional campaign management, found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
“Weapons don’t have to be fired to cause damage,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a stir when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and holders (which is regulated in the U.S. in the second amendment of the Constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton is elected and can appoint his judges.
Trump's campaign says the media has taken his words out of context and that Trump has not defended the violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent oversight and from Phillip for endangering personal security, unlawful use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to the report with a request for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news office in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one responded to the call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services within a short period of time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely appealing, just as London 2012 was, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympics have been huge benefits for both Startford and East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new jobs, 40 000 new jobs and put an end to the youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would ridicule ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow, they turn out not to be right.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave a legacy in the form of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team on Heathrow that, in the deadline and with a budget set, introduced an 11 billion-pound infrastructure investment program, starting with the T5 terminal - which was voted the best terminal in the world for five years in a row, to the T2 terminal, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third runway, which is worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge achievement for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be the same.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trading for the future and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and an earlier Treasury Department's Assistant Trade Affairs Committee.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on the cat and mouse in blocking ads
Trying to get around ad-blocking programs has become a cat and mouse game for companies that make money from online marketing. At least that's what one of the companies that programs such software says.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site saying users could update the filters in their program and re-block the ad on that social network.
Facebook said Tuesday that its desktop website will change the encoding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to find out which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims to have bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of war between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to get around them has been going on ever since ad blocking was invented," and that Facebook is likely to come up with another custom fix.
The fact that the company owning the world's largest social network has engaged in the war only proves how much of a problem the blocking of ads has become for the industry.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair last year, and Adobe uses ad filters around 200 million people worldwide - nearly four times that of 2013.
Mobile advertising now amounts to 84 percent of Facebook ad profits, with 1.33 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The spokesperson said the company was going against desktop ad filters because mobile ad filters for social network and Instagram mobile apps don't work.
Desktop ads still make a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update the ad preferences tool to give people the ability to better control how ads appear.
On Thursday, Facebook said Adblock's new filters were worrying them because they could also block content that was unrelated to the ad on the site.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, so we’d rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an event in which a woman who had probably tried to commit suicide was run over on the highway in the early hours of Thursday in the morning.
The accident occurred on an A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actor of the "desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road, run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but according to police, still not all have been identified. Police are appealing for these drivers and all others who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" move in a situation like this, attorney Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
The prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases over the past five years, drivers appear to be not responsible.
In both cases - one of which involved a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of charges of negligent homicide after she knocked down and killed a man lying on an A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the victim, aged 22, was drinking alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who was responding to the distress call - was driving in a reasonable manner and that the presence of the man on the road was "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident at Morges should report to the police on the phone number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20 thousand visitors to Prague to come to Prague.
On Friday, the executive director of the AČCKA, Kateřina Petříčková, said this.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival describes the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35 thousand people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, due to the high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized enterprises," Petříčková said.
According to a survey of organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of 3100 crowns per person per day.
In order to support their travel, gay tourists are provided with special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clients are very lucrative, interested in stays in higher price sessions with a high standard of travel services and spend more than others," Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will also take place as part of the festival programme this year.
Experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China are presenting.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main topic this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, which are family, prevention of AIDS and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be the traditional procession with allegorical cars on Saturday, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
The procession, which was attended by thousands of people in recent years, this year will honor the memory of the victims of the June nightclub attack in Orlando, where the attacker shot dead 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrate forty years.
The inextricable DIYers Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained both small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot episode of this bedtime series by director Lubomír Beneš premiered on 12 August 1976.
The creation of this animated series, which is now known to audiences in more than a hundred countries of the world, was the cartoon jokes of the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, which he invented for a magazine with two handymen Mr. Ouholíček and Mr. Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the dramaturg Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimír Jiránek to cooperate and together they created the film Kut'áci.
Today's appearance with a yellow and red trick and a beanie and a radio came in 1979, when a series for Slovak Television began to be created in the Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were given to the DIYers in 1985, this time they were filmed directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of whom were contributed by Beneš's son Marek.
There are currently over ninety episodes with stories of these handymen, who get everything under their hands, but they never get angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, which is evidenced by the familiar gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theaters, and characters or other toys with a depiction of Pat and Mat are a hit of every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and a two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen one sports and one of life for you.
Both have a good ending.
So let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved a historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
The two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
What kind of things do people spend the most at airports?
This is Friday's review of the world's websites.
The first medal of the Olympics.
The island state of Fiji celebrates its historic success.
The rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the UK team in the final of the Olympic tournament of seven-year rugby.
This is the first medal that Fiji won for themselves at the Olympics.
The wait for the first precious metal took sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympic Games was sent.
A great credit to the success is borne by coach Fiji.
Ironically, it is Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen he could be satisfied, unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play freely and easily and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually dominated it and a small state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The report was carried by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without her hands and legs since 11 months, has been given a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old girl rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her doll's arms and legs and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year, doctors gave it only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He also has an outlook.
I saw her introducing herself to other children with the words Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands, my mother added.
See what joy the doll has brought.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
CNN finds that people spend the most on bottled water at airports.
The Hudson's travel essential stores chain has released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products customers in its stores at airports most often.
The water was sovereignly the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight placed in the top ten.
Ninth place was occupied by a large pack of M&M candy with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who's closing the top ten?
It is the only thing that can not be eaten.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laugh.
Rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have reigned supreme in the category of two without a helmsman for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, the disparate pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing competition since 2009.
On the lagoon of Rodrigo de Freitas, they claimed their 69th win in a row in Thursday's final.
How are we different from others?
We're just prettier, Murray joked already during the Olympic regatta when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand duo.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different from the others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is remarkable also because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-foot-long and hundred-kilo chasnik, an academic-looking Bond is five centimetres smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have different natures.
Bond is studying and doing finances, Murray has had a charity boxing match.
They don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's getting on the ship basically with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what can go wrong, admitted Bond, who even at the press conference clearly demonstrated that Murray is dominant in the crew.
He was the first to answer, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, it destroys opponents with calm force.
They are running their pace, and although they are often not yet in the lead in the middle of the track, their gradual acceleration has not yet been found by opponents.
We race on a two-kilometre track and we never wanted to go the first kilometre.
We're just trying to drive a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said thirty-four-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007 when both were members of the gold four without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to move on to two without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, they probably made up for the biggest defeat of their careers and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was intense.
We did everything the coach told us and didn't ask questions.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be bloody hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well, Murray said.
We know that everyone wants to overthrow us from the throne.
We've got the target on our backs all the time.
But we are trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to projections of NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions similar to Earth's conditions could once prevail on Venus, whose surface is hot, water-free and CO2-saturated.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rotation speed of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, it seems that Venus once boasted a thin Earth-like atmosphere while turning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet, the areas were probably drier than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule it with life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus previously also used the Sun, which was 30 percent more subdued.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venus model, during a slow rotation, he exposes his day to the sun for almost two months at a time,” said Anthony Del Genio, a GISS scientist.
This leads to surface heating and rain formation, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like an umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is an climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus, similar to evolution, previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over the course of several billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated, and water vapors were burned with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, leaving only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche team, citing the impossibility of participating in the decision-making process on team issues as the reason.
Colorado executive vice/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move, saying the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
I have been thinking long and intensely over the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and vice president of hockey operations are in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that impact the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team's benefits.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him the best of luck for the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with the 2013/2014 Avalanche.
He led the team to a gain of 112 points and first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and he has not always had games after the season in the last two years.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015/2016 season and was five points short of winning a second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who has enrolled in the Hall of Fame, has won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea oil rig are resuming talks and interrupting the strike
The leaders of the negotiating parties said strikes over wages for North Sea oil rig workers were being interrupted while all sides of the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
The strikes against the Wood Group oil service company were sporadically carried out on North Sea rigs operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve current disagreements," the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a number of all-day meetings over the coming few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is in protest against wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid out about 9 percent less to its North Sea suppliers because of negative market pressure.
The reduction in corporate rates comes after a 10 percent cut for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave operations in the field of oil and gas in up to 10 countries for modernizing its processes - immediately after a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Parliamentarian from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest working disagreements of the entire generation that led to the strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some," he said in a statement.
By comparison, in 2016 almost 1.4 billion dollars of investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected, while the average for the past five years was around 7 billion dollars.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiades
The Kepler Space Telescope's latest mission to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of speeds of star rotation from the Pleiades cluster.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at different speeds, and also how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star mass, its age and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a new report.
The Pleiades cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching a state of maturity and have formed for about 125 million years.
Now it is turning the fastest.
At moments of maximum rotational speeds, these teenage stars release huge amounts of star wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotational speed slows.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by measuring the time between discovering recognizable points on stars ---- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, bigger make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
“In the ‘ballet’ of the Pleiades, we see that slower-spinning stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of stars and the speed of rotation.
“The pleiads provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars,” Rebull said.
There’s still a lot we want to learn about how, when, and why the stars slow down their rotational speed and so to speak, “hang their dancing shoes on the cloves.”
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualification Agreement necessary?
If I didn't apply, then the qualifying agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work without applying for specialization education after graduation?
The point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy only in a somewhat more distant hospital, but in about half a year it could be possible to free up space in another, where I would like to work afterwards.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation about half a year, the question continues.
Answers Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation stipulates the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and can be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure a return on the costs incurred associated with increasing or deepening the employee’s qualifications.
In the field of health care, there is long-term pressure on the non-constitution of these agreements with a view to ensuring the work mobility of healthcare professionals, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognizing professional competence and specialized competence to pursue the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly the case that participation in specialization education is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not an increase in it).
This means that the qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs amount to at least 75 000 Kč.
No legislation even stipulates the obligation to apply for specialization education.
The Act only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialization education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to pursue the profession of a doctor already thanks to the completion of the necessary university studies, even if under the statutory conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law anticipates a situation where professional experience completed in another field of specialization can be included in the specialization education of the doctor, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
In theory, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the interviewer's situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is recommended to consult with the relevant Department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Occupations), since the Ministry of Health by law provides a counselling and consultation service related to the inclusion in and course of specialization education.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from Syria's Halab are asking for U.S. intervention.
The United States has not made any effort to end the siege (rebel parts of the city by government troops), and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, the White House said.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; however, we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces, who support the military loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that from today, strikes in the Halab area will stop every day for three hours to allow safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
All military activities, air strikes and artillery fire are to be stopped from 9:00 to 12:00 CEST.
While UN humanitarian operations chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed this, he stressed the need for at least a two-day cease-fire.
According to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who operate in the eastern part of Halab, already controlled by the rebels, turned to Obama in the letter.
They write that during the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and noting how complex Syria is, but it does little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly obscured threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors pointed out.
Doctors said there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in the past month, including 15 on the hospitals they work in.
We are most sad that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Young children with such serious injuries come to our emergency room that we have to choose between them those that are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the blast interrupted oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They gasped, and then their lives were over - before he could really begin, they reminded.
The army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebel-controlled eastern part of Halab in recent weeks, with more than 200,000 people without food supplies inside.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes by the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break the encirclement on Saturday after three weeks and launch a counteroffensive.
Both sides were then joined in and around the city.
