Barack Obama to receive Nobel Peace Prize as fourth US president
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway, for the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and the $1.4 million check will be given, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The White House chief of staff will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he will meet five members of the committee, which he was selected from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then scheduled to meet Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will take the prestigious award.
He will be awarded as the fourth US president, but only the third to receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he is taking the prize as president, who is currently at war in two countries.
He further increased the war effort a few days ago by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which will not be forgotten to highlight any of its critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to put them on charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a particular charity.
The busy schedule will then be led by the president and the spouses to the banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, there will also be a ministerial chairman and 250 other invited guests.
From the beginning, Obama was more restrained to the price.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also reiterated several times that it is not only a price for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said he was a "challenge to action" for him.
Nature conservationist accused of extortion
Litoměřice police have accused the chairman of the civic association Society of Nature Conservation Litoměřice of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed for some construction proceedings, for withdrawing appeals he demanded money from investors for his advantage, Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The chairman of the Society of Nature Conservation of Nature in Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Three-class containers of Brno do not smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort beverage packaging, in South Moravian villages you can meet sorting containers at every step of the way.
And in Brno?
There, to set aside a few minutes before you find suitable bins.
I do not want to say that the waste is not all sorted in Brno.
But it seems to me that we are the second largest city in the country is under interest in this problem.
Brno is in the forest league sorting waste not only because, as citizens, we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into sorting containers, but above all by the number of bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle in the center, for example, in the collection basket?
It's a finished kumsht, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have hit so far is on the Moravian Square opposite Potrefená Hus.
Let Mr. Onderka and my colleagues not be angry with me, but it seems to me a hell of a lot.
Not to mention that in other parts there is no honey.
Many of my friends prefer not to sort the waste.
Out of laziness.
It's far from the garbage cans.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colorful garbage cans on Kounicova Street.
Luckily, on the way to schalin, I came across the right place.
But the garbage was overflowing from it.
After all, this is still the center of Brno, which perhaps represents the city the most, right?!
But ecology and aesthetics probably don't really care about the Brno Socialists.
They would rather buy the city a hockey extraleague that will embarrass us all over the country than buy a few extra containers and offer the sorting of other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption after a while of browsing on the Internet with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian Region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money for pensions and sickness
After the left added to farmers or officials, despite the government's opinion, there may not be money for pensions, sickness or building savings in the budget.
But also on interest on the national debt or on international litigation.
It will cause problems for those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists promoted the increase to some groups, they relied on the government to borrow additionally for sensitive expenses, pensions or sickness. "It's just putting off the problems for the future, putting mines," says Janota.
The borrowed money is paid for more and more interest and sometimes has to be returned.
The state has no power to choose where to take it.
If they do not reduce the social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To everyone to whom the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later their children.
People don’t have to worry about pensions or sick pay, from whose account 1.8 billion has disappeared, they get them.
However, at the cost of the state becoming more indebted – next year, only 163 billion will not be missing in the treasury, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it, the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Due to the transfer of money in favor of several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year for the completion of highways and railways.
These are mainly already retrained and under construction sections that cannot be redesigned and possibly cheaper.
Preserve at most, which is not free.
It means delays or halts of thirty large buildings, the drawing of European money is also at risk, warns Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed that it will solve the loss of money in a Solomonic way – it will reach into the dividends of CEZ, which the state mostly owns, and from them adds to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is no longer a worthless source.
Last year, 18 billion came from CEZ to the budget.
Every year, the liquidation of environmental damage is paid from dividends, supplemented by a pension account or serves as a reserve for the forthcoming pension reform.
Moreover, this trick, according to EU rules, is the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, the carnival of transfers does not end there.
Nearly three billion were deducted in the budget for various compensation to victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for litigation, even building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is uncertain.
That's the lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, reach for the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already launched two-billion-dollar project of the State Treasury, which is intended to allow online to monitor what the individual authorities spend on.
The first stage will kick off in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a single button.
The revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you can transfer from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is exactly what the U.S. company VMware aims, focusing mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at one and the same moment, said Sristinas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first presented a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Smartphone virtualization is no fiction.
VMware has successfully demonstrated a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, on which the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems were also running side by side.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization, and devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains suffers from hoteliers
Bare slopes are not only worried about the Krkonoše ski lifts.
Missing snow discourates people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a large number of visitors on our website.
People go through offers, they are finding out the prices, but so far they are afraid to order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this Christmas will be on the snow or on the mud," said Martin Jandura, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want a New Year’s Eve stay in Špindlerův Mlýn exactly to their liking, you should not hesitate to order.
Whoever prefers to save money and the quality of accommodation is in the second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
So far, Spindleruve hoteliers offer mostly only weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to give them up for a while, but then they'll loosen and go for a shorter time.
And then the spare rooms will be dwindling quickly," Jandura estimated.
Free beds on all winter dates are still offered by the Vrchlabí travel agency Ingtours.
We are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
Half of the seats in our offer remain free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute,” said Ingtours’ director Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still offer the Vrchlabí travel agency also, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fortnight of February is also well for sale, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People wait to see if they can think.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also sell out," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, it is a little better than last year to occupy the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're about five percent better off.
We have the last few places on New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January and it is also selling well in February," said the director of the best mountaineering hotel, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are also occupied by the Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain available in the newest Jansko Lázně hotel at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised by January this year, which we already have about sixty percent occupied at the moment.
A little weaker is so far February, but as soon as the snow falls, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly rise, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia Hotel.
On a larger snow, however, the Krkonoše hoteliers have to let go of their taste.
It is supposed to cool down on Thursday, if there are any precipitation, so in the mountains should be snow.
But then the warming is to come again, informed Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec Králové Institute of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comical with what schoolboy strife Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the stupidest, on the Afghan question.
When he finally sweated his eagerly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out to copy it over a Bush Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "like in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to even use the name of Bush's January 2007 statement as the name of his own declaration: "The New Way forward".
Three years ago, he himself criticized Bush’s idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq plagued by civil war as “irresponsible and in its aftermath of catastrophic decisions.”
But the subsequent months showed that Bush’s strategy based on the recommendation of field commanders was the only possible and highly successful way so that today there is no talk of Iraq in the news sessions.
This did not improve the reputation for Bush, but objectively left his successor with a much more grateful initial situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCistal, who even, despite subordination habits, harshly criticized the hesitant shooters at the White House.
He asked 40 grand of men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he did not fall for anything better, so at least he cheated the general by 10 thousand soldiers.
He was able to wring the promise of another 5 thousand from Europe, although he himself originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic thing about Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in as early as 18 months and end this process within three years. Obama's entire doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that the half-hearted increase will give the same fruit as the advancement in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-ordered, its leaders honoring the agreements.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied on and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are being prepared poorly alike to change the master every day, depending on how convenient it is.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain only a potemkin village for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
The balance of interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complex due to the lack of clarity of the conditions that further complicate Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the construction of an "acceptable state," which is a minimalist goal of the entire operation, does not seem to be too real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is striking with its voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent to the turmoil of war for the purpose of "early return home" will cause a miracle done here, only a truly romantic, fact-touchable, can only a truly romantic, fact untoken.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will see this as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is lagging to the minus.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their constituents how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically interfering with the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the intensified sanctions will not affect Iranians, there will be a difficult question before the United States whether to try to solve the problem by military force.
It will be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will proceed to the victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential election, and therefore enough time remains to come up with another strategy if this proves to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers No Longer Get Cash Rewards
Senior executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which responds to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading executives will get shares instead of money that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, the shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is leading the Wall Street rewards with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott said.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Goldman Sachs came under criticism after putting aside nearly $17 billion (nextly $300 billion) for rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
The total remuneration in the company for this year, according to Reuters, will likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
High rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in a number of countries with the arrival of the financial crisis.
Britain said on Wednesday it intends to spend a one-time tax on bankers' bonuses in excess of £25,000.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
The record five women took the hands of King Carl XVI of Sweden in Stockholm today. Gustafa this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists among them, the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müllerová was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider along with their compatriot Jack Szostak for his research in the field of chromosomes.
The award for chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonah along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last laureate was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for his analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
This award went to Charles Kao for research in optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each awardee received a diploma, a Nobel Prize, and a certificate of profit of financial reward.
For each category, it amounts to ten million Swedish crowns (approximately CZK 25 million).
If there are more honorees in each of them, they divide the reward among themselves.
The most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to US President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway, this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, as he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, he heads a country that wages two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defending his policies, however, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary for the fight against peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Vaclav Klaus will accept Finance Minister Eduardo Janota on Friday morning, considering remaining in the government because he does not agree with the form of the state budget for next year, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps even Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, it has too much a deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was announced by the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss his next position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But on Wednesday, the House agreed to the left's proposals to move money and raise money for the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the proposals of the Social Democratic fact that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, a sharp internal political dispute arose, due to which a question mark over the further action of Fischer's caretaker cabinet, which was agreed in the spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as the House adopted it, is essentially liquidating a package of austerity measures that Fischer’s government enforced in the autumn and which, according to her, is supposed to stop the state’s indebted debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the law on the state budget, said at today's discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had neglected the "serious problem" which is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
Today, he says, he no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government could bring improvements, which could also rely on a broader consensus of political parties, the president said.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget is frightening and the government should consider further existence.
ODS vice-chairman Petr Nečas told the Czech News Agency that the concept of a caretaker cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer called similar words "strong statements" in response.
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, responded to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit prepared by the former Topolánek government for this year and which will exceed CZK 200 billion is frightening.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called the approval of the state budget for the next year a success.
The people were also satisfied.
Mandela played in Clint Eastwood's novel by Morgan Freeman
South Africans say the new Hollywood movie Invictus: Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, about its struggle and victories despite some critics that the lead role is played by American actors.
The story tells the story of sport, racial circumstances and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, in his life story, is represented by the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said ninety-one-year-old Mandela asked him if he could portray him in Eastwood's film.
Another important role in it is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's drama from the boxing environment of the Milion Dollar Baby boxing, for example, has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the abolition of slavery, who eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the U.S. and even a god in God's Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years in prison for his active work for ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for the undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him
The film is a true story of Nelson Mandela joining forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. President-elect Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story on screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role to bring it closer to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I'm printing your hand, I take over your energy, it's transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
The big surprise for him was when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember the bell ringing the bell, he opened it open to me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the actors' characters compared to their actual roles under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus won: Undefeated positive reviews and there are also talk of Oscar ambitions.
Todd McCarthy, a film critic for the Daily Variety, summed up his assessment in the words: "He was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
Secrets of the glow over Norway unsolved: Russians tested rocket
Above Norway, a special light effect of unknown origin could be observed.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful, and the missile referred to as the type of "Bulava", which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the black nightmare of both Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the tests of the rocket did not have the proper effect on the success of the test flights.
The bull originated at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already written about "a rocket that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th attempt was normal at first.
Only at the end of the flight there was again technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" started from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donskiy, which was under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows it to be fired from a vessel that is in motion and at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed broken "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals defend themselves and say that it is impossible to speak unequivocally about failure.
The first two stages of the missile lasted and the accident affected only the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first stage.
Although not a single test start was made without a mistake, the management of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The nearly 50 percent success rate is therefore filled by optimism and so still claims that "Bulava" will fly without problems once, and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear units with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract at CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again play in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team in an emergency and will probably play in Friday's KHL's duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of forty in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulaš was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agreed to help the team.
We just need to resolve some formalities, the AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club Sergei Nemtskov.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only be involved in one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can elevate the spirit of other players, said Germanov.
Fetisov will become Russia’s oldest professional hockey player in the event of a return to the ice.
In the NHL, the legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford in the Philippines, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union jersey he won two Olympic golds, seven world titles, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the junior world championships.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice in a Detroit jersey.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has complied with the unions. Cancels all overtime
The management of Hyundai in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the often ordered overtime that unions declared a strike alert on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk.
However, the leadership wants to agree with the trade unionists on one more shift this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, which is crucial, so voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, Vaněk said.
The server Sedmička.cz reported that the company of employees who work on Saturday's shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People will receive it retrospectively for a working Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaněk, the company has decided to change the way employees motivate them with the proposed overtime.
Either they have the overtime surcharge paid or they can take alternative leave on December 28, and thus extend their Christmas holidays by a day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive paid fares and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and pressing point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists, as well as protesting employees, who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees of the carmaker were forced to work out a two-hour overtime virtually every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the deal, unions will call off the strike emergency
The next talks between the automaker's management and trade unionists are due to take place on Friday morning.
The head of the union, Petr Kuchař, said on Wednesday that if they agreed to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the automaker escalated last week on Wednesday, when around 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay and alleged bullying.
The management countered that overtime employees had to do to meet the requirements for the supply of cars.
Trade unionists in their announcement of a strike alert on Monday also demanded that no sanctions be sanctioned by employees who cut production last Wednesday.
In the field of overtime, the company demanded that the company ease overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5000 crowns for it this year.
Hyundai nošov in Prague now employs 2000 people.
The company started production last November.
By September this year, it has produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on 'hardened' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already acquired immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly as some already available drugs.
AIDS can not yet be cured.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of virus multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are already ineffective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from UŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that a substance called metalocarborans acts on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, and therefore they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘enthane’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their bonding to the viral protein.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two poly-walled cages made up of the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of HIV that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteases caused by HIV, there would be no mature infectious viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is further systematically altered.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIV-enatable substances has been tested in a test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as with clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect due to resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical treatments make metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
A quarrel over the budget. ODS has embarked on Fischer, who defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year "scary" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The ODS statement was described by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He says he's taking the time to analyze.
ODS Vice-Chair Petr Nečas said that the concept of the caretaker cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to lean on a minority in the Chamber of Deputies, which is a struggle with a growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and Social Democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas pointed out.
On Wednesday, the Chamber of Deputies adopted the 2010 budget, with left-wing amendments for more than CZK 12 billion.
The House has increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's reproach of the proposals of social democracy was that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, thus satisfying the government's wishes that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke about disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to leave office in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation could have looked different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment for the prime minister after the government on Monday.
He suggested that he was considering remaining in office.
This is due to his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks out in favour of the next fight with the budget deficit, according to Nečas, the ČSSD nominees have nothing to do in the government, which pushed through the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other laws increasing deficits, such as those related to sickness, pensions, or an amendment to the Service Act.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by ODS are not guilty
It's a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the US.
He reminded that in several ministries there are people in deputy positions calling for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of combating the level of the government deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he will lean on the left-wing majority that is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
But then he cannot count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I did not think about it, and when it is topical, I will focus on it, said the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, who was nominated for the government by the Civic Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the afternoon of the European Council.
At the request of the Prime Minister ODS retreated
At the same time, Nečas stressed that the ODS would probably vote in the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday if the prime minister of the Civic Democrats did not explicitly ask for the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, then responded to the question of whether the ODS did not burden the absence of the party leader in parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about the Bolshevism of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD order, fewer trains will run for almost the same fare
Czech Railways will cancel or restrict some less used express trains and locals from December 13, while others will strengthen the connections.
The overall scope of transport will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will get more options to connect to the capital, the railways on this track will add one set of pendolino.
On the contrary, the high-speed train stops driving to Bratislava.
Fewer speedsters will also ride on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be significantly limited.
Of the regions, the railways plan the largest reduction of transport in the Hradec Králové region, a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to the increase.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also canceled and the operation of several express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to only some days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovice must transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburban Esko system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the destination station Prague Main Railway Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
Pendolino to Bratislava will not take passengers from December 13.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport orders and pays the speedsters, in total, to pay the so-called demonstrable loss, the railways will give the railways four billion crowns next year, as well as this year. Localities are ordered by the regions, in total they will pay eight billion crowns for them next year, while the state will contribute less than three billion regions.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For locals and expressways, the railways have a newly concluded ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The railways praise the system, which is why they probably did not reach an increase in the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only take place in the case of one-day ČD Net network tickets and cheap online eLiška tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will now depend on the distance traveled, it has been uniform for the journey between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Filipino militants still detain over 50, children set free
The militants today in the southern Philippines kidnapped 75 people, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 accusations.
All 17 detainees were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 militants are said to use hostages as a living shield while fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to arrange the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed unit of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
Police initially chased the kidnapper over the violence that required the settling of accounts between two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguidanano, martial law has been declared due to a recent massacrifice in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the election to the governor's office were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of the southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatiuan family, was arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood's new film Invictus (official title in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-aparheide fighter was carried out by Morgan Freeman, who he is said to have chosen Mandela himself for his portrayal years ago.
The sidelines of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pionaar were played by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the film into cinemas, they emerge from the responses of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born 18. July 1918 in Mezno, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993, along with de Klerlek, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was president of South Africa from 1994-1999.
High expectations, as it comes public at a time when preparations for the World Cup in South Africa are culminating, but at the same time the media is shaken by the disturbing news of the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the people of the Black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the responses to the new film in South Africa are generally positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the lead roles by "slauched" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman says he is proud of the new film.
I dreamed of the role for many years and prepared well for it.
I have also personally met Nelson Mandela to - as they say - as they say - to draw his energy, he said in an interview after the film's ceremonial premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can recall Mandela's personality and message with the film.
It's the story of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the rugby national team jersey
Based on the book of the British writer John Carlin, a loosely translated title In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and a play that gave rise to the nation portrays the South African human rights advocate during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, therefore, during the film, tries to eat two racial and mutually defined groups of the population for many years, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also enters the acting role in the South African national rugby jersey on the course of the World Cup, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in a jersey, which is understood almost as something sacred in South Africa, Mandela harvested a large ovation of a predominantly white audience alike fourteen years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reconnect people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
But the White South Africans are skeptical how, in a recent interview with LN, a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, revealed in an example.
The championship will begin on 11. June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns is burning in Louny region
The fire was engulfed in the morning by a transformer of Čeps in the water supply near the village of Výškov in the Louny region.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesperson for the Ústí Regional Fire Brigade, Lukáš Marvan, the fire is involved.
Originally, firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later they reconsidered the opinion and the fire extinguishes with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical fault, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to company spokeswoman Pavlay Mandátová, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, accurately quantified it will be possible after the fire.
According to Mandatová, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
In the ten years of the company Čeps, nothing similar has happened, defects of this type are unique, she added.
According to ČEZ spokesperson for North Bohemia, Sonia Holingerová Hendrychová, the supply of electricity, was not interrupted, the functioning of households, authorities or companies did not affect the fire of the transformer station.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, 400 kV power lines and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers converting electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system and the line route with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura files a criminal complaint for defamation to three ČSSD governors
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura will file a criminal complaint today for defamation to three social-democratic governors.
And this is for Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura stated this in the Twenty Minutes of Radiožurnál.
The lawsuit is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some regions.
In the end, however, all regions signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three governors attack us and talk about the fact that we choose raisins, while we brought an offer only for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is for defamation against the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all regions that they have not taken their actions in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be further the continuation of the media show of Mr. Jančura, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for his companies and his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend the good name of mine and my region, and to call the other governors.
I suppose that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr. Jančura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that it will invest several million crowns in advertising, which will draw attention to the disadvantageous step of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and he wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with Czech Railways and did not announce tenders for the contract of around CZK 150 billion.
According to Jančura, similar conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančura has already threatened a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't stop, we could lose bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know which man he is, I will not say his name, he told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccination against pneumococci will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci will break down the habits of ingrained habits since January.
It is supposed to be the first to be free for families and optional at the same time.
However, there are already voices that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci are peaking.
The Institute of Pharmaceuticals is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccinations
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children who were born on August 2 and later on August 2 may be vaccinated against pneumococci free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccinations.
Those who started vaccinating last year or early must pay for another revaccination.
The first dose of vaccination must be administered between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated against pneumococci.
Parents paid 1600 crowns for one benefit or more.
Four doses are needed when vaccinating the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between 300 and 450 thousand crowns per year on vaccination doses.
But it will save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has given about 500 thousand a year for all the vaccination of children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including inflammation of the cerebral membranes and blood poisoning.
According to the survey, up to 28 children under the age of 10 die from pneumococcal infections in our country in a year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced paid blanket vaccination of children against pneumococci in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it will be paid for by insurance companies and optional.
Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association, suggested that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at the international conference, which our association participated, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been achieved.
I think this is the path we have to take now, Kalovský said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against pneumococci.
We are not considering it at the moment, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň said.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
Hana Cabrnochová, chairwoman of the Professional Society of Pediatric Practitioners, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of booster vaccinations "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we fairly understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of fresh parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococci from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first blanket vaccination of children paid for by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving for further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy the substances themselves
This is related to the concerns of general pediatricians regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines should have been purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in a similar way as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
But some MPs feared that insurance companies could "take money out of health insurance."
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual general child doctors will invest 40 thousand per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, Cabrnoch says.
Son of an American artist 'stealed in a museum'
The son of renowned American fantasist creator Frank Frazetta has been charged with attempting toil paintings worth $20 million (£12 million) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
The name Mr. Frazetta and the other man used a digger to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, 81 years old, is famous for creating the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time this happened, the artist was in Florida, as reported by the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official who said Mr. Frazetta Jr. could have been motivated to the crime by long-lasting family disputes.
Before the police, Mr. Frazetta earlier issued a sworn statement, age 52, that he did so on his father's behest, "to get into the museum in any way possible and move the paintings to malting areas," as the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta senior denied granting any such permission, as the agency said.
Labour opposes planned tax increases
The ministers advocated an increase in taxes and cuts of spending, announced in a preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and unions.
As Alistair Darling reported, the Tories "wasted" the possibility of showing that they are serious about postponing the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
The chancellor also came under fire due to a disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Divinance regarding social insurance
The union protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance of "problems."
Social insurance is increasing - the increase is around £3 trillion a year - outraged the community of entrepreneurs who said it was a tax on employment, while there should be a focus on rebuilding the economy.
This increase, limiting to these incomes of more than £200,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POBS PBR
Social insurance will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deter more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New Taxation 50% of Bankers' Bonuses
Increase in 1% tax firms for depreciation for small companies
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind power plants
Increasing the assessment of pensions by 2.5%
According to an estimate by the state financial administration, some incomes of 30000 pounds will be reduced by 90 pounds a year, and some revenues of £10000 will be reduced by £190, while some £10000 revenues will increase by £10.
Ministers announced that their deficit reduction target in half by 2013 means "complex decision-making," but they insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall to 5% of the highest incomes.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms has denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"They're big numbers. This will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is an absolutely essential requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident that the growth of the economy should take place at the turn of the year.
But the elaboration of a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In his opinion, he said, the economy's decline was 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5 percent decline, predicted in April - as loans were £3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
Wasted opportunity'
The Conservatives, who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday, warning of a "crisis of indebtedness" by Labour, called the planned loan of £789 trillion over the next six years as unbearable.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan, how it could be paid, added, "cynically" postponed this decision until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
"They have not added anything significant that would be feasible," shadow finance minister Philip Hammond said. "They had a chance to do it, but they were wasted."
" All important announcements will be made after the election, if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike Tories' proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a larger scale.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by raising taxes and spending cuts should be used to boost spending next year and not to cut the deficit, and argue that the plans are "built on the sand."
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said of the timing of the message - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay off next April - that this could lead to the chancellor's accusations in the election campaign if the money was difficult to get back a year later.
But Labour is insisting on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
Suspected budget'
Although ministers did not disclose the details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that a reduction in public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The accolade of the Augmented Institute of Budget Studies said the chancellor's figures suggest substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in the future include transport, higher education and defense.
"It's really very painful so far," said director Robert Chote.
"All the important statements will come after the election if we win them," added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to the Revira's Deloitte account revir.
"That was the report of a suspicious preliminary budget. The markets are implementing it.”
FBI conducts investigation into 'U.S. prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting investigations at Pakistani prison among five Americans suspected of links to extremists.
The men were imprisoned for attacking a house in Sargoda's eastern Punjab province, as the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was an investigation into whether they were the same men who have been declared missing in their residence in the U.S. state of Virginia in the past month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them say they are native to Pakistan, one of which has Egyptian ancestry, and the others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested to know under what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they were staying there," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the imprisoned and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really missing students," she said.
Pakistan's embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a house belonging to one of them's uncle.
It said that the house was always the center of interest of the local police and that there had not yet been brought charges against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, Reuters reported, but said the United States must "cooperate much more narrowly with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was reported by their families in late November.
Rejecting an amnesty for Iranian abusers.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International's expedition.
The report details the "metaluile" regime before and after the contested presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was in danger of rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have described the criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran, and dozens were killed after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them were in custody and prosecutors have sentenced the last five people to death.
The BBC's correspondence in Tehran, John Leyne, now found in London, said that earlier in protests by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini declared the unjustification of some methods of torture and banned their implementation at the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticisms of legal power have been tolerated, as our correspondent has said.
Falter confession'
Amnesty International quoted a report by 26-year-old computer technology student Ibrahim Methari, who said he was charged with "work with Facebook" and protesting against the election results.
"I was often in the face," he said in his testimony.
"They fired me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, head... They threatened me with execution and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the protests after the election and was tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iran's senior civil servants have denied allegations of rape, but admitted that torture took place.
Amnesty also listed the case of a former prisoner who said he was being held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizow.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate post-election unrest and government responses, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees were published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn the monument in Bristol into a downhill runway for the race.
The downhill runway for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the downhill track in Brandon Hill Park was a short ski jump in front of the 100 m long downhill runway.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the downhill runway, but that it was really daunting.
It was a wonderful view of the flashing lights of the city downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
The awards were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the downhill runway.
After Thursday evening's race, the snow was left to melt.

Can a Muslim be a Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and widespread alarming reports of the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and wondered if Muslims could integrate - and whether they are integrating - into one of the continent's most open secular companies.
Some readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French don't like headscarves" (2006), this elegant and discussed study of contentious issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years and whose impacts are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's latest book has a broader and much more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the base.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now take care of 5 ÷ 6 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that are most concerned about them.
Should a Muslim enter into a marriage in a mosque or a town hall (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use a hobby-oriented banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These are these seemingly secularly contentious issues that are discussed, and that are part of everyday life rather than the political drama that the media employs.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known persons, including Tarik Ramadan, the Arab, a Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the discussion of how one can be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their own.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen interview are inclined to believe that it is the opposite of Selafi — supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia—the group is small, but it affects European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adjustment requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so stubbornly defend the lay public) are truly devoted to the idea of pluralism.
He is of the opinion that Muslims probably have less experience on matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found out "tightening the screws of values".
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The most gratifying prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the planet's other environment.
The bordering ice melts at an alarming rate, which affects the animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In the book "On the Dark Ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well aware of the complicated history and practices of whaling, he describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to seize a white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a brave fourteen-year-old lifeguard who fought only with the cove of the musket is truly a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears who swam behind the bodies of their maids were caught and sent to the zoo and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed at once in one of the circus tents.
Even today, the enclosures in the zoo typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adult individuals in the wild. The resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algaeing within the hollow their hairs of the coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat of hunters threatening the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and skiers are hunted, and all are armed with powerful assault rifles to blast their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunters, and that ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers clear and dismal responsibility for science for the Arctic and an engaging glance at how the future can change it.
Scientists don’t have answers to everything.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.
This is due to lack of tests.
The research paths of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries indicated for the first time how the movement of floating ice took place.
Submarines during the Cold War then mapped the moving remands as they passed them.
Satellite exploration and extensive fields of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still held thanks to intrepid individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinarily fragile world of the catchment system ̈inside the Arctic ice, created by the dripping of salt water, which shrinks when freezing.
But from the above-mentioned bear to microscopic miracles, all this is doomed as soon as the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... that could be us'
6000 Marines lay wreaths on the graves in Arlington
Petty officer De'angello Robinson, 19, traveled for seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made their way from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington, to decorate the graves, was the day in which he paid tribute to men and women who once wore the same footwear.
In the months we board, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I do.
He was one of the more than 6,000 volunteers to gather that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at veterrane cemetery in several departments at a commemorative ceremony in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester's burial company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a commemorative ceremony in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. Morrill and his wife Karen make this journey every year and stop in various cities along the way to honor the memory of members of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcestesters are not looking for a profit, wreaths across America, which they also lay in other states.
In this year, volunteers laid more than 16000 squires at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, the graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at the New York City Battery Park, and at a memorable location of Flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year running, Walmart Foundation has been donating more than $150000 to buy and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she made a trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Ms. Hunt said it was her way to restore what the victim was doing.
It's a small way in which citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like a visit to a family grave.
Covered into the cloaks of warm cloth, volunteers walked through the cemetery along the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed for the older graves of the First and Second World War and from the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine to the greystones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arc of the top.
Near Section of Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained truly quiet.
The associated service organizations donated 1000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the grim mood of the just-running wars filled this area.
Some were sincerely crying, others prayed, and families and friends clung to each other in the cold air.
Some read the names out loud, engraved in the stones, while others bent to see the little black-and-white name tags, pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
She was driving eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of the sergeant of the naval artillery, David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, she said.
"Although I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has imprisoned a U.S. government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, according to State Department officials on Saturday.
A supplier that has not yet been identified has worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. interest section in Havana, sought access to a detainee who was imprisoned on December 5.
Certain charges have not been disclosed, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical articles, cause the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
In Cuba, there is a young blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are tracked and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sanchez has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country so she could accept the prices, but she was denied permission.
The U.S. contractor detention may be due to rising tensions between the communist Castro Brother, ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was pursued as a "delay tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report on the imprisonment of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy has stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and create more room for the opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average wage of a civil servant is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used for texting messages, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one daily wage.
Internet usage on the island is limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to sign up, must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is a rarity.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in a prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, a press officer for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which in any other open society would be legal - let's say free mobile phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Group's U.S.-based Human Rights Group program, which recently published an unfavorable report on freedoms in Cuba, entitled "New Castro, the case-true Cuba," as an allubial on the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader and a replacement for the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivacco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a single day.
He stated that all solutions would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are moving towards more extensive dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are uncovering plots of men's broadcasts to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday revealed an alleged conspiracy leader to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, saying they hoped the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters who snoop online and seek out radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were searching for a grey rebel figure, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after first discovered them when one of these men posted a comment approving terrorist attacks on YouTube's Internet video page.
Saifilllah took the lead of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, he tried to help them get to the remote region of Pakistan in the zone of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in the convict of al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern district of Sarghody, far from the mendaughter mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered a strike unit.
The official said, a official said, referring to the preservation of anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to get approval to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the exercise of Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - emphasizes the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, much more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, discarding those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
American false recruits have been subjected to a special investigation in al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because, given their potential approach to U.S. targets and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA, said terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years in which it would allow him to join because U.S. intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to enter these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been followed so much? Mr. Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the site.
Tens of Thousands Protest in Copenhagen, Demand Climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday, demanding more forceful action over climate officials from the city's Bella convention center.
Protesters reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police consider that the number was closer to 25000.
The incident was relatively quiet, and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day when a minor incident took place in climate talks sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists were walking through the city and carrying banners with the English inscriptions "This is not planet B" (i.e., second-rate) and one in Spanish, which proclaimed "Earth says 'enable'."
Several celebrities, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, participated in the protest, saying she had traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the bloating state of the country involved in the impact of climate change that is still taking place.
That's the partial reason we decided to join this great march -- to walk through the world and appeal to world leaders to put forward a fair, ambitious and binding deal, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it is necessary to perform it, it can not be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the center of Bella, saying they had detained 19 people, first of all because they either wore masks or had pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the uninvolved spectators, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate makers, activists disguised as athletes and in black suits have laid several charges near the Copenhagen main canal, located near several ministries.
They agitated the buildings, he said, opened with flares, but followed "several major explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is that something I was not aware of the activity of it).
Then he went on to Chinese and said, "Because the venue is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful, depending on the prospects of everyone.
The focus of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change is visible, he said.
In other words, "I can also say that this is a violation of the actions or the freedom of other persons.
Test data reveals constant persistent racial differences
Last week's federal certificate of attainment of mathematics was a welcome element of the good news regarding the public education of the district Columbia.
Although the precinct lags far behind the country's high-performing systems, the certificate showed greater advances in fourth- and eighth-grade pupils in the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures of the National Attestation Centre for Education Progress is the persistent differences in the knowledge achieved between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average result of the white pupils of the fourth grade of Columbia district in the last two years increased from 267 to 270 points (from possible 500), but their African-American peers increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the gap in the knowledge achieved increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress in African-Americans in eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a shift by a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result for white pupils was not included in the test results, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture within six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth-grade students in 2003, when the first NAEP in the precinct was 60 points, was 60 points in the scale (262 to 202).
Although the achieved result in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly approached 58.
Some advocates of education in the precinema have said in the last week that the results, celebrated by the secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) was more widely stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the total support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality of education in the precinct.
I'm not jumping up and down because of the dispersion of two or three points, said a member of the D.C committee. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of elementary school in Eaton.
Frequently criticizing the style of administration of Mrs. Rhee, Ms. Brown said that reporting on test results means middle education in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see pros and I respect that.
But what is terrifying is that we did not devote almost any time and energy that was necessary to devote to our secondary education.
Ms. Rhee said the precinct's effort is to continue to find better ways to focus on the needs of low-profile students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new curriculum reading, Wilson's reading system, aimed at upper-class students of primary schools and high school students who failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their corpenial career and significantly lag behind their peers.
The daily math and curriculum of the teaching of mathematics to the sixth grade, emphasizing the real-life games and experiences that have reached the precinct under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think that we should continue to work and perform the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the class level, Ms. Rhee said.
Others said the results of the NAEP clarified the question of whether Ms. Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It's a definite highlight of Mrs. Michell Rhee's, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California at Berkeley University where he studies test results in urban areas.
The convention of redress is to target funds and administrative reforms to schools, located in the worst parts of the Columbia precinct.
Thus, the focus can bring political reverberations that are directed against an important agenda.
But the rebuke also belongs to the other city directors who are trying to keep the middle elevation between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can be trusted to give their children excellent public teaching.
Mr. Janey, now the headmaster of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element in reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the precinct to ensure the legitimacy of schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to push through changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his association of teachers last year for the 185-day school year, which he considers a "symptom" to look for a bigger increase next year.
Make higher education part of a better future
The tour bus drove into Gettysburg track with a loud respite.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, got out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green grasses.
Gracielin's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the dormitory.
Now she and other eighth-grade students in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38690 a year, their position was more than fearful visitors enthusiastic students.
Yes! Yes! That's it! cried to Graciel, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully when they told them a low proportion of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of seven, which they visited on their three-day tour and were now completely preoccupied with the future news: the question is not whether you will enter the dorm.
The question is from where.
However, this is a main problem regarding the high number of children of Spanish immigrants born in the US, who are excluded from universities or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive a dormitory education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "rainship generation" of Spanish dormitory pupils - the remarkable results achieved state that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American people, have made it to the United States without finishing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underscores their point of the way forward for the generation that played a marginal role in the field of the country's labor forces.
Those who achieved higher education say they had a natural inclination to school and innate penetration and an effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and were looking for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in the help of Graciele and millions of children who would like to go to the dorm - especially if these efforts persist over time.
Taking into account that I'm going to take children from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at each single point will not solve it, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these children with a preschool network in all ways to go through college.
The federal program that funded the Graciela tour of the rails is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (advanced), provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run dormitory preparatory programs that are for students from small-income groups in secondary schools and continue until these students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than percent of whom have entered the dormitories, according to U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches deal with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of fears of violence and political instability, Iraqi governments have managed to get major oil companies to rebuild its malaise infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil has entered into ten deals with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in the restoration of the Iraqi oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies left with capital participation in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached field agreements, which were auctioned in June.
The share of U.S. oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened the door after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you are here in the first place on the way Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
That will be long before anything else is in Iraq for sale.
Concerns about security, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military are likely to discourage U.S. companies from much more intense business in Iraq, which has demonstrably the third-largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
U.S. firms were in some cases at a disadvantage, especially China’s and other government-controlled energy firms have noticeably lower operating costs and are more susceptible to risky because they don’t match shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to make deals with the ministry.
Leading U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with the Iraqi oil ministry and offered technical assistance in past years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were allocated at the end of this week.
The state-owned National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers for more contracts than all other companies and left with large stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic, as well as technological force, oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We believe that Chinese society will be comparable to the competition and will live up to its obligations to Iraq.
Companies that were tentatively selected for the submission of offers, which were then compared by the ministry according to the price per barrel and the ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
At the impact of the U.S. missile at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, a top al-Qaida operations planner was apparently killed, as reported by U.S. counter-terrorism officials on Friday.
As confirmed, it could be the second fatal attack on one of the highest leaders of the terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets landed in a quarter on their car near the town of Miran Śah in the province of the sovereign Vaziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have announced that the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft by the CIA operating in the zone of illicit Native Indigenous tribes.
These were brought to a white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said along with the Pakistani Citica intelligence agency, which was on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the local gunmen rushed to the point and quickly seized what was left of "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness who said Somali was dead.
Somali was cited as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military operations planner, who ran the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan and Pakistan regions.
He was involved in the world's contrition, said a senior official who does not wish to be named, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. air strikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in the attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Qaeda's top leadership and, based on them, he planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said Somali was quickly progressing in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known person for some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second high-ranking al-Qaeda or Taliban leader, who should be killed from September, when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of the militant faction in the zone of indigenous tribes and three other top-of-headed opposing, was killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has declined from average approximately six operations per month to two, according to Long War records, a website managed by a non-profit group.
The decrease may have reason in the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people who suspected were informants, the site said.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Kabul resigned.
A top United Nations delegate in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to step down from his post in March to end a tumultuous term that was obstructed by charges of widespread corruption in the election of a U.N.-backed president.
Eide's departure is taking place because the Obama administration has decided to send another 30000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. schedule for lowering the state of affairs, which begins in 18 months, should be a call for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian employees assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but that he simply fulfills the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to file a report by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it is high time to look for the heir, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban launched a search for compensation.
Officials said he was deciding between Staffan di Mistura, who has Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, the Frenchman who previously led the UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his earlier deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the provincial presidential election in camouflage the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied the claims, but said the allegations of Galgraith -- who had been released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high level of skepticism in view of international intervention" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the citizens' top representative to coordinate the relief of efforts at the U.S. forces leadership in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to an Afghan mission, as he would, as he says, he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at limiting its efforts in Afghanistan, saying that the UN cumbersome hiring regulations undermine its ability to exploit capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, he said.
This is a disaster and I cannot continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers would soon impose "more significant sanctions" on Iran due to lack of engagement in talks on his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip around areas where fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospects for armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the probable development. ̈ ̈
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is an inherent unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a pack of incentives and barriers" would require "to force the Iranian government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its residents will suffer extraordinarily" sanctions.
According to a White House spokesman on Friday, Robert Gibbs, the administration has taken European leaders in warning that Iran would bear serious consequences unless it puts its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop his expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In interviews in Geneva 1. He suggested on October that he wanted to return to talks on limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of its uranium-rich stocks in exchange for the urgently necessary fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has set itself up for such an agreement as a way to establish confidence between the two sides and to give time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be withdrawing from interim agreements - partly because the expert says, because the Iraqi leadership is divided in opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as far as Iran's stubbornness is concerned against the international community in the case of some of the proposals he actually agreed to in early October, I think it has brought the international community, including Russians and Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on December 31 to respond to proposals before he returns to seek other elections, including surveillance, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission at the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unfounded and unfounded accusations" before some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities, saying it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "for achieving an adequate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying into the Kurdistan region, rich in oil, to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, mainly because of borders, property rights and the distribution of income.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce potentials for conflicts to avoid delaying U.S. plans to limit U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dampen Kurdish concern about persistent depression. The official U.S. sites quoted Gates as saying to Massouda Barzaani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We wanted to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "The Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave."
Then they learned that when official government sites in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began cheering young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We didn't keep anything for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China’s more than 30-year-long policy of having only one child has been introduced, creating two generations only notorious and dug-up children, affectively nicknamed “little emperors,” the country is threatened by the population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy went into effect, according to UN data.
The population division where the population aged 60 and higher is predicted to grow thunderously from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. That's far above the total average of about 20 percent.
Imbalance is a larger rich coastal towns with a population with a higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and higher made up nearly 22 percent of Shanghai-registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and reducing the number of labor levels in the future."
He says it's about "being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual calming
As it was put into the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese one-child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate established during the Communist Party government.
The pairs who violated politics faced immense fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official posts have pursued a policy that helped the country prevent critical absorption of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned to pursue policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women to undergo abortions in the second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist-species abortions, leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men to women.
In past years, population officials have been gradually milder in their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed extracts of exceptions - including the inhabitants of cities, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were only children -- and in 2007 they alleviated the diction of their slogans promoting the hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing's population research, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incitement to multiple births.
Almost overnight, posters were exhorting parents to have only one child, replaced with copies of the regulations, detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent officials for family planning and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who have decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
The Fucking Response
Although officials in one rural town around Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the launch of the campaign, most urban precincts did not report changes.
The Huinan district with a population of 11000, for example, it still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shangahate's Caul, said financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don't want to have more children.
They want to provide the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese who only have inadequate health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a docile detention network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West are assessing the one-child policy wrongly as a questionable legal question, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is in a union with the first child at seven months of pregnancy.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: "We were the center of our families' attention and everyone took care of us.
We were not used to provide care and in fact did not want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who has expressed his own translation company, much more openly.
For two-career middle-class parents who reduced the birth rate, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-olds grow up view parents as the fighting-up on the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of living for themselves, he says.
It is one child who puts enormous demands on the time of parents, he says.
A mother has to sacrifice for at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still questionable questions of propsor -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a summary ready at a time when the baby is 9 months for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We don't want to bring too many sacrifices.
The UN group outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-relenting unruly opposition and mutual accusations -- again focused on Friday on the release of a document that proposes an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas over the next 40 years with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden at the earliest date.
The text, which can provide a way out for the final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as it illuminates the path ahead.
But there was an important progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc task force, this text inconspicuously states how much money rich countries should provide to those poor to deal with global warming in the short term and long term.
And it provides a full range of elections for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of the global temperature rise should be, which political officials will still be able to tolerate.
This delivers the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, the top official of the Washington-based Sierra club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, a briefing of 180 pages of a meeting to focus on what a top official described as a "great image" on climate issues at the United Nations, Yvo de Boer.
It outlines the outlines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions by year to 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period to 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union swiftly discussed on Friday a promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries accept adaptation to climate change -- from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
But Friday still introduced the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in last week's talks.
Todd Stern, a special U.S. envoy on climate issues, has dismissed speech calling for binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries compared to the voluntary presence of major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration raised a tougher line against China, without officials from the Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States will not accept a treaty without transferring major developing countries and taking action, Stern said, also complaining that the text was not enough to secure restrictions and should be vetted by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei told U.S. chief negotiator on climate issues that either a lack of "common sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" led earlier this week to a message that the United States would not help China financially so it could cope with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the world’s major powers at stake, the turmoil erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly underway to preserve individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States to meet their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that the world's two dozen of the world's most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative for carrying out more vigoulent actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate to Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the main powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers responsibly in their actions.
It is clearly a game about the fact that the new economic hegemony is unfolding, Ulate said, which also serves as a regional adviser in regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable effects of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to enforce a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said enforcement by small island nations "spraised the political push for the entire political process" partly because they are now unified and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
Negotiations have prompted a new urgency as soon as delegates targeted the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of government face the deal.
High-ranking officials, such as India's Environment Protection Minister Jairam Rames and Chinese Deputy Minister, stepped out of planes and ran through the halls of the Bella Center to close the meeting door and new conferences so they could set out the demands that will be assessed next week.
The total scalp of the rally - when 13000 people moved every day from and into the convention center, guitar-playing activists staged at night ironic about the countries they thought had sent them, and there were hand-handed proposals on paper rather than by e-mail -- controlled by a challenge.
Intensity is only an extension: in Copenhagen, almost all key ministers were present, and earlier on Wednesday, 60 heads of state were present.
We have gone into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the deputy minister for global policy at international nature conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
British First Train at 140 Miles Per Hour Pre-Issent Feelings this Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle slit through the darkness as a sign of the departure of the train, which revolutionized transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed passenger train reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and will pass from Ashford in Kent to London's St Pancras and surpasses 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger train outside the London.
It hopes that the new service may connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large agglomerations of Midland, the north and Scotland with London.
Neglected standing waters should short shortage traffic times in passenger transport and on business trips, and the transition from aircraft and cars to the railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties were recruited for this vision.
But the dozens of pounds of pounds necessary to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now hampered the construction of British high-speed lines.
The High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a validation study to the government, handed over her report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times reported.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route of London's connection with western Midland has been designed to five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods where life-centright adhesion could be problematic.
In the open countryside, it was planned to reach 25 m of the final route.
HS2 also envisages identifying three choices for a large-scale high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
A preferred option is a form of Y-shaped, one high-speed track should lead to western Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like the most powerful choice has taken place," said the railway expert.
As soon as it is done, the driving times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals should allow trains to run at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already designed to carry 400 m long trains capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate every hour on the London-By Birmingham track.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20000 passengers per hour if needed.
Given the capital restrictions, it is assumed that an existing station would be extended to accommodate a high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry say that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the beetle will not make the final decision before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the net should be built in pieces.
Trains should first be operational not on high-speed lines, but already existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain driving times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered a decisive point of liaison to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, the landmark for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers pay £75000 mortgage on Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory front seat bench in the Chamber of Deputies, was paid by taxpayers thousands of pounds of the cost of the year for the orangery he built at his home in the constituency.
A prison spokesman who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that MPs had lived "from rations," increased his mortgage to £75000 to build an oak-pained extension at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
Municipal authorities approved the claims in a timely manner, and so it was not interrogated by Sir Thomasen Legg, who carried out the controls on the member expenditure. Last night, Mr. Duncan expressed his demands "it didn't mean to be cleaner or simpler."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two-storey houses in the village in their constituency Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the tax office agreed that Mr Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is in the plans marked as an "orange".
Neighbors describe it as a "greenhouse for fun and treats."
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last settlement of the mortgage.
The committee told him last month that he had violated the rules after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupilary security to a £271406 mortgage from his property in London to a house in his constituency he bought in 1991, the year before he became a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £1400 a month for the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, its demands increased to more than 1800 pounds per month.
The interest of Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage repayments could not change at this time, indicating that all this was intended to finance a loan of £75000.
The standard RBS mortgage repayment variable fell from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March this year in December 2007, leaving.
The latest document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1250 a month this May.
Mr Duncan left his job as the shadow head of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed him and said MPs must survive "to an allotment" after the expense scandal.
"In principle, it is nationalized, you have to live on the tribute and treat you like a s***t."
He said, "I spent money on my garden and claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn stake, but I won't do it."
An MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil businessman, was first invited to explain his releases in May when it emerged that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the tax office was approved, that it "can be considered excessive."
One of the activists dug a pound in the shape of a pound in Mr. Duncan's lawn in protest after it revealed that he had claimed £4000 for three years.
When he was asked about a mortgage increase last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was due to a capital increase, which was approved by both the tax office and subsequently Leggo."
He added: "this is not a question of hiding and zigzagging or breaking the rules or something else.
It's absolutely straight line down, according to the rules, justified and that's all.
It wouldn’t be more pure or simpler than many other things.”
Come and see the cottage on the bright Encostal coast with the advent calendar.
The Brighton coasters found a new meaning of life in the Easter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual activities with creativity, urged 24 owners to decorate their huts for each day in December, and to use the Christmas calves as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when it allowed visitors to view the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and a bishop's bread and mulled wine, provided free of charge.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cottage featured Janetta Tozer's work, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV assistant from Hove, is a priest without a scholarship in the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion much more important for the people of post-Christian society.
"Why, as a church, should we expect people to come to a foreign old building? I feel that the Church should come to the people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of the advent calendar in the cottages originated as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we have tried to try and present it in a spiritual way.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding an emphatic and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and Copenhagen, where the police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources, and a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, manifested in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, aimed at accepting by Friday an agreement that could come into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, the clear evidence of the current demonstrations, has contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to AFP, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the procession, when a group of about 300 protesters, dressed in black, began smashing shop windows with cobblestones and hammers.
The riot police immediately intervened strongly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and clarified that they were mainly members of "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups, which already appeared in April at a NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "indiscriminately" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and sittings "held in the streets on Saturday night" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
For the speakers was built a stage in front of which a spiritual meeting took place by candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, created the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning, at the call of Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for the "fair climate."
Today we are going to the streets to demand the settlement of the environmental debt in favor of the south, explained Lidia Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't say anymore: it's time for that, Benin singer Angelique Kidjo said.
In Africa, rivers and watercourses are drying up, today we can walk in them, and it has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of fighting for another world has come closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the figures of the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice." “There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world.”
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which there are many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people marched, mostly students, in red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters took to the streets with the demand of strong measures against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
There were dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elects its president, Georgia condemns it as a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as an independent of Georgia, and Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this step as a "farce".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in this first election after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at GMT at 17-hour.
According to officials of the Abkza Elimination Commission, the turnout a few hours before the polls closed was 58%.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsha, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which condemned the election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian rule," said his spokeswoman, Manigaladze.
In addition to Russia, they recognized the independence of the territory with 216,000 inhabitants of only Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, Kwarchiya Svetlan, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagaps.
She was one of those who came to the polling station at a school in the capital, Sukhumi, a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential election in the region on the shores of the Black Sea, which boasts of beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapsh are deployed alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Galio, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful conduct of the elections have received a warm reception from the district mayor of Beslan Arshba.
"We Abkaz, are grateful," he said in a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and, in particular, its decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, toasted a glass of vodka on it.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former Vice President Raul Khadzima and two traders Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control the Abkhazia rail network for a period of 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vita Bganba, says he does not support the current government or the opposition.
To win the election, an absolute majority of 50% plus one vote is required.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive duel must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding an emphatic and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on that occasion.
According to police sources, at least thirty thousand people, according to police sources, and a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, were manifested in the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, negotiating an agreement that could come into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
For the speakers was built a stage in front of which a spiritual meeting took place by candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to AFP, incidents occurred shortly after the parade leaves, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing shop windows.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, while several demonstrators knocked to the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrests of between 600 and 700 people and clarified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups, which already manifested themselves in April at a NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, one police officer on his jaw was injured in a cobblestone and four cars were lit near the squat near the incidents, which had the result of the police sources, the arrests of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are concentrating on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while police helicopters have skyrocketed in the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, created the first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for the "fair climate."
Today we are going to the streets to demand the settlement of the environmental debt in favor of the south, explained Lidia Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bová, one of the figures of the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice." “There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world.”
Oxfam has summoned several well-known figures, such as Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which there are many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothing and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy, manifested in front of the city of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred protesters also met with a demand for strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (East).
There were dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general grammar school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said on Sunday during an interview for JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" as part of the reform of the general grammar school, even though their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of the grammar school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week, and for all there will be the same program from general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end with hypocrisy", because according to him, the specialization S is no longer focused on exact sciences" but "essentially the best students in it".
ES and L specializations cannot be for some pod-specializations, it continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would make it difficult to learn geography and history in the last year of vocational grammar schools".
A survey by the Ifop news agency, published on Saturday, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) disagree with the government's project to abolish mandatory history and geography teaching in the S graduation year, which is why many intellectuals and teachers criticized this abolition, both left and some right-wing MPs.
The minister, on the contrary, added that "it is not possible" to abolish philosophy in the program of specialization S graduation.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they said sacrifices the pedagogical education of future grammar school professors.
As part of the Master's degree 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, the admission exam focused on their field will undergo an additional examination verifying their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will participate in professional internships during the second year of the master’s degree and will perform as a professor-treatment first year before the pupils.
If you add up all the internships you will be offered to you before the admission procedure, you will gain more experience with the pupils, almost 300 hours, continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen summit: this is a challenge announced in the morning by Jean Jouzel, the vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) at the instigation of the University of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
As reported by one AFP journalist, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the conferences "Ernest", a kind of one-day seminar composed of fifteen-minute contributions from experts, which will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and on the basis of which they would have a greater desire to learn something more, explained on the occasion of the conference 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named after the fish from the local pond, which was named this way by students.
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
"we can talk for hours about climate warming, but we can also summarize the underlying goals in minutes," said Jean Jouzel, who spoke before fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will recognize that "The Copenhagen conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations."
The videos made at these lectures will be placed on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February, and more will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry guards in prisons, planned measures
Prison guard unions announced a "general mobilization" on Friday as they demand that bonuses and overtime be reimbursed for them for financial reasons for the Christmas holidays.
The Prison FO (Department of Supervisors 2) asked employees who will not be served to attend a demonstration taking place on Tuesday morning in front of the prison facilities, and to "block" them and draw attention to the "stealing of their wages".
CGT for prison guards (3rd departments of this sector) urged them to "consult a gathering in individual prisons and start a major mobilization" with the "shameful and unacceptable" that "overtimes and surcharges for work at night, on Sundays and holidays" worked in October, not to be paid in December.
The first union of guards, the Federal Union of Prison Guards (Ufap/Unsa), "call for overall mobilization (...) in order to show discontent and outrage."
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime increased much in 2009 and not all of them were included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts owed will be paid in January.
The office said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the unions of the prison guards in which she assures them that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts that the prison staff spends on ensuring the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the minister writes in her statement.
I have ordered the administrative directorate of prisons to take immediate measures so that the situation, which arose by a poor assessment of the number of overtime, never repeats itself in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
Thus, the December wage will be low, with the exception of the executives who receive the famous bonuses for performing the function and fulfilling the goals, Ufap/Unsa states, and for those "only there is always a place in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the interregional FO union in Marseille has been indignant and announced its decision to boycott "all meetings and summons" until further notice.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays, if the surcharges for these days from the month of October are not reimbursed in December, as well as overtime, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when they are giving us more and more work and more tasks without giving us additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking employees to pay for it, reports CGT-in prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the union, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds are little, the Secretary-General of Exchange, Jean-François Forget, said.
Obama Says He's Giving 'better Gifts' on Christmas Than The Ones He's Getting
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided in Oprah Winfrey's "Goddess" of Oprah Winfrey that as far as gifts are concerned, she has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I receive."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special release of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday night at ABC about how they are going to spend their Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a small four-legged companion of the family gets his gift.
Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will also "of course" receive a gift, as the excerpts of the show's preliminary broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband's claim on the quality of the gifts she receives: "Well, I gave you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Well, of course, it's true, he was forced to agree by the president, but immediately afterwards he pointed with humor with humor to the first lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?".
On this one-one very relaxed show with the famous presenter, who strongly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obamas also talked about their most popular donors, which they received as children.
Barack Obama launched a round with a ten-degree gearbox, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father gave him at Christmas, which he rarely encountered.
I remember seeing my father, who came to see us at Christmas and how he gave me the basketball, the president told me.
Long after that, I realized that he had given me the ball.
The First Lady, in turn, remembered the dollhouse.
I didn't know how to organize it all in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved the little dollhouse, Michelle Obama remembered.
Johnny Hallyday back-on, RTL reports he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles for "injuries" after a major surgery he's had in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his closest ones, while the RTL station said the singer is in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again operated on in Los Angeles Cedars-Sinai hospital on Wednesday night after U.S. doctors found "injuries arising from surgery" the prolapsed disc that he had undergone in Paris on November 26, his press department said in Paris, saying these lesions required "repair surgery."
However, the press department of the singer tried to reassure the public and said the situation was "under control" and at the same time announced that a new medical communiqué will be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, which is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications."
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes we will be a little more confident, RTL adds.
The press department, on a query, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also reports that according to "some sources" no drain was placed in Paris after the first operation.
The rocker was operated on at Parc Monceau International Clinic for a prolapsed disc.
The operation, which was planned a few days in advance, was carried out by neurosurgeon Stephan Delayoux, a doctor well known in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the information of the RTL.
After the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at a Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles due to an infection that occurred after the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad time" but added that he "doesn't worry about the rocker" because he's a great "warrior."
He called me just before I was flying to Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupidity because spending 12 hours on a plane after an operation is no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, said Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that the infection was "stopped."
Mr. Camus also said he had met with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any odd concern.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on for a "small tumor of the small thyroid" and then for a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every health problem has been very closely watched and commented on. Fans and journalists noticed that the singer was having difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to again deny the news of the new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: premiere of Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in a big pool, won the 2009 European Championship title in a small pool in Istanbul in a discipline that he particularly likes: 50m freestyle.
The first day of the championship, at which the overalls are allowed for the last time, only three world records were set, although many more were expected.
One of them was surpassed by Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová to 200 m positional race and two of the remaining men's relay of Russia on a 4x50 m positional race.
A big grimster for Bousquet, who took a 50-m freestyle world record, of which he is already a holder in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal disciplines swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, where ten swimmers started for the first time instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Feskikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there is a world record within my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore jumpsuits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The jumpsuits have helped 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host them in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the overalls this time was not helped by the Germans Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in a large pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the record, which holds the 400 meters freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), in front of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't give everything to the race.
I knew I wasn't going to break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I've done my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent for the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Zoola's Romanesque sarcophagus board was auctioned for $1.5 million
A plaque of the Romanesque sarcophagus, which did not belong to anyone other than the French writer Emil Zola, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is significantly more than estimated, said Sotheby's art dealer.
The price of this two meters long and 63 cm high front plate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
"in representing four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satyra and bakchants, is a rare piece of similar pieces in the world, there are very few, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is the item that was probably the most bidding for, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola bought this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The album was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated her with her bath in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly the President of the Council before the coming to power of Marshal Petain.
It remained shaded for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz found out while searching the Louvre museum database that this album was part of the "remends of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
An interrupted attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday decided that the conditions for the transport of the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelay, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of a safe withdrawal, were not met.
After a telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything suggests for the time being that there is no possibility to carry out this transport, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
A Mexican government plane that flew back to El Salvador for President Zelay on Wednesday, said a source at the Directorate-General for Migration.
The government of the putschists wanted to force President Zelay to "discussion" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only in this way would give him the possibility of a safe exit.
But the ousted president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exiled head of state.
The government of the putschists "wasted another failure when it wanted me to give up my office (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he often speaks to the political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the ousted president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the interior minister of the puts government, Oscar Raul Matute, the Honduran radio HRN, said on Wednesday.
I will not apply for asylum to any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is headquartered in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors of Zelayi's departure mobilized on Wednesday's supporters of the ousted president who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army strengthened the protection.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, criticized the attitude of the putschist government.
They are showing their marginal stance on international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who became close to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown 28. June, on the day he organized in preparation for his re-election public consultation against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he unexpectedly returned on September 21 and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of here, he will be arrested and will be held accountable for the crime of "treason" of which he is charged, the putschist government says.
Puchist President Roberto Micheletti managed to organise presidential elections on November 29 to replace President Zelay.
In controversial elections recognized by the United States, but condemned by the countries of Latin America such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelay's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade license urges optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, and the results of the U.S. trade balance testify to the rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the deadline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with a technology dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is concentrating on "half full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on the numbers of the U.S. trade balance, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, had expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
A big novelty is the growing volume of trade, especially the export of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the United States' main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against all expectations, and the number of job seekers reached the figure of 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
Treasury yields with a view of 10 years increased to 3.482% versus 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the yield to 30 years rose to 4.492% versus the 4.408% day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime booed "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime were booing the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day on Thursday and prevented further demonstrations at which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in white", wives or close political prisoners were booed directly on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro regime during their march towards the center of the capital with a demand for the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Down with Yankees!, "Merglacians!", "The streets belong to revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the regime's advocates chanted with their fists.
Dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who had arrived "to ensure security."
The day before that, there was a similar demonstration in Havana against the "Ladies in White", but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana's Vedado district, about ten dissidents were detained by members of the plainclothes police, who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, AFP reported.
According to this journalist, the police have loaded dissidents who were booed by proponents of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions lasts only a few hours out of the rule.
The holders of the 2005 Sacchar Prize of the European Parliament of the "Wounder in White" organized an unauthorised march for "the release of all, according to the dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a sentence of 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their arch-enemy, the United States.
The finished miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by proponents of the government regime against "opponents of the revolution."
Cuba, with the Communist Party at the head and policy of one-party government, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disregarding human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman with a knife killed an 80-year-old man and injured 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five other people in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the peak of Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in a pharmacy or in front of him, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
The severely injured old man, born in 1929, died in hospital from injuries, according to the police syndicate of the Alliance.
In this pharmacy or before, the attacker then attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, aged in his 30s, began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital in which an eighty-year-old man died.
The life of the other injured person is in danger, according to police sources, vital authorities were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as a police source said, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more people, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old man, the other seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, because everything happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher's knives he carried crossed behind his back, said the head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to the testimony gathered by the AFP, tried to stop and disarm the madmen.
I saw a guy in a green jacket about thirty.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A mob rushed him, including one city police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at 61 level, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to detain an armed man and were wounded by their fists, a police source said.
The incident occurred on one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a seventy-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big blow on my stomach, Frederic Allione, a thirty-five-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later came the second thirty-year-old person, who also had stab wounds with a knife.
A man who did not have identity documents was subsequently arrested by the state police.
The state prosecutor in Nanterre handed over the matter to the investigative department of the regional police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody and awaiting questioning.
A police source has not ruled out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said six police officers needed to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "completely off yourself" as "all madmen of this type, whose strength increases tenfold in action."
U.S.: Polanski lawyer again asks for an end to prosecution
Lawyer for Polish-French director Romano Polanski again asked in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) on Thursday to halt prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of the moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the principal of the film "Pianist" has criticized the serious mistakes before three judges of the appealing court of the second district of California, which occurred during a trial at the time of the events of 1977.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now and immediately, lawyer Hummel said, adding that Laurence Rittenband's behavior "had a chill in his back" from the judge who was deciding on the matter at the time.
According to him, the judge (who had already died in between) allegedly before the verdict was made to the public prosecutor, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious offense against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski for: and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and sought), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr Wells finally declared at the end of September that he was "little" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, lawyer Hummel will demand the holding of a trial in which he will be able to present evidence of his claim.
The prosecutor reiterated what was already said at the first state, namely, that there will be no serious study of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski comes to court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court handed down a "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a underage girl, aged 13.
Since then, he has never re-entered the United States.
A prosecutor's deputy in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
In this case, we want to say not only to Roman Polaski, but also to other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs. Asayam.
He is of the opinion that the director "requests court kindness and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now has 90 days to take the decision, also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape."
Lawyer Hummel was not alone in asking for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to stop the prosecution.
The victim's attorney, Samanthy Geimer, also again asked for the prosecution to end.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear the perpetual harassment every time the Polanski case emerges and added: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski Arrested in Switzerland on September 26 at U.S. Order
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible banishment.
Wall Street ends no direction, hampered by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended direction on Friday, the market is floundering among indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising price of the dollar: Dow Jones gained +06.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final deadline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and Nasdaq, with a technological dominance, leaving 0.55 points and finished at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,166.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased greatly, and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also a confirmation of the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that "helped to improve the market mood in terms of the stability of the economic recovery," summarized analyst Charles Schwab.
In the U.S., retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate by the index from the University of Michigan, U.S. consumer confidence also returned, rising strongly in December to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices were hampered by a new increase in the dollar price against the euro, which is the highest in two months, which "strike downwards sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology stocks are losing ground.
The securities market has fallen.
State Treasure yield with a view of 10 years rose to 3.540% versus 3.482% on Wednesday evening and with a view of 30 years increased to 4.49% versus 4.492% a day earlier.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa.
After a month-long travel across South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates on Saturday are about to cross the target goal to achieve their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great celebration of beauty took place for the second year in the vicinity of Johannesburg and so far five candidates have won the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariata Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so many experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone confided.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, from 17 o'clock (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream a more beautiful country in which I put on a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy that I could experience it twice, confided Miss World by Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new appearance of the country and its "landscape that takes your breath".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, Miss is now concentrating on the competition itself.
India's Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priinky Chopra, elected in 2000, who also took part in Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winners, who both became the stars of Bollywood.
Being crowned as the world's most beautiful woman is every woman's dream, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassador of my countries and I want to go home with a crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be presented by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former beauty queen of South Africa Michelle McLean and Miss World Executive Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is hard to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World Competition.
As last year, the candidates participated in safaris, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Unusual to the president, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful commemoration will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I couldn't even dream of.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, she says Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm.
According to David's son, the news of the state of Hallydaye is "very positive."
The news of Johnny Hallydaye's condition is "very positive," as his son David assured us on his arrival at Los Angeles Airport on Friday, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday during the withdrawal from the plane, which he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 a.m. local time (21. hour of world time)
The singer's son, who was calm, said he would "as quickly" come to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, which Johny Hallyday was admitted to Monday for a post-operative infection after surgery for a prolapsed intervertebral disc, which he underwent in Paris on November 26.
According to a press release, the singer-super-told of the night in Los Angeles was "indicated to an artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was previously brought to artificial sleep by Cedars-Sinaï doctors in Los Angeles. The hospitalization occurred due to infection after surgery of a prolapsed intervertebral disc made on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the AFP photographer, his wife Laetitia attended a school performance of the French Lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The head of the department of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology of the hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catone, reported that he was leaving for the singer to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer was strongly accused by DDr Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons have said they were outraged, M said. Camus.
I've heard of the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes Johnny Hallyday went too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon.
Personally, I spoke to the doctor by phone and he assured me that this trip is no problem, which surprised me greatly, because I myself have already twice suffered from a prolapse of an intervertebral disc, he added.
Shortly before, he said on the RTL radio station that the singer had apparently departed after a Paris surgery without a drain, without anything."
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in art circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, on which he was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg in the removal of a hematoma resulting from a brain haemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times convicted of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
The lawyer of the medical chamber, Olivier Metzner, described him as a "man without scrupulous" who is "regularly" summoned in front of the medical chamber, and whom can not even be "recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux commented on the matter on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had a "absoluble course" and the postoperative examination was "normal."
The operation was not hemorrhagic, therefore the introduction of drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer's health problems have been growing since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with a question mark.
It is clear that the date of the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 (In Amiens) appears too close, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and invites the Nouveau Centre party not to continue to enjoy their abbreviation.
The UDF association, controlled by MoDemFrançois Bayrou, on Friday responded to the attempt of the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, to appropriate the abbreviation of Giscard's former party, not to use the abbreviation in any medium under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to appropriate the abbreviation UDF, saying that François Bayrou did not deserve to carry her inheritance after shaking hands on the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC) movement.
His move won support from MP Hervé de Charett (former za-UMP now for NC), who attributes ownership of the UDF brand, because he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property (L'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF Committee run by friends of François Bayrou, who has no intention of being expropriated, stepped out of his silence and filed a formal request to the minister and MPs to stop using the abbreviation and return the ownership of the trademark, under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the troubling statements that you will propose to your political movement + retake+ of the abbreviation UDF, the Association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centristte.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement +Nouveau center+, with the slogan +UDF of today+, also note the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC"immediately to remove all references of the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (of its) website."
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "in order to hand over the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that UDF "is a full political movement since 1978 "and recalls that Mr. Morin and his friends "call" to leave in 2007 , "to create a competitive movement, like others in 2002, to establish an UMP.
According to them, the Nouveau Centre movement does not have a right to use the abbreviation UDF (Uion pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to create a committee authorized to defend the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscardo d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered a trademark", he was not "for three years a member of UDF" but UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent manner, he used the non-existent registration of the acronym to do so on his own account.
This intuitiveness begins to transform into a crime, they declare, and then express themselves with irony on the NC strategy: "It appears to us that in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to create a name for yourself than to step out of anonymity by fraudulently accepting a name to which we have no right."
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
The court in Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier and sentenced whether he took advantage of the ten-year-old billionaire's condition of the 80-year-old billionaire's weakness to deprive her of part of her fortune, which is accused by her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
The photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of the famous, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, which is a crime for which a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of 375 000 euros is imposed.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in a case that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter attack each other and are struggling to manage the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a colleague of three doctors.
The heiress and the main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the prosecutor's office in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by March 10, 2010 while also giving a statement on whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and in which period.
I think he'll undergo it.
I will talk to her about the matter, said Mrs. Bettencyourt's attorney, Georges Kieman, after the hearing.
As for the lawyer François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
It's an excellent news (...). The expert will show that he manipulated this old lady who needs protection (M. Banier), confirmed.
It has been two years since the only daughter of Liliana Bettenciourt has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-rounder accusing of using the state of her mother's weakness for many years to obtain a billion euros in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, has always denied being manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's judicial speech by lawyers sometimes turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she expressed her distrust of her husband Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt adds, according to the lawyer,: "Could you explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier once or twice a day for Fifteen years.
Ever since she married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The Public Prosecutor’s Office in Nanterre again found that the conduct of the complainant was not justified, all the more so because the guardian’s judge had dismissed her request for the opening of proceedings for the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of participating in the court, she is not under the protection even in custody.
No one else will act for her,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, a prosecutor’s representative.
The court finally decided to comment on Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers's legitimacy at the time of the trial.
The Managerial Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary...
For more than a decade, it has been reminiscent of the behavior of the management of large companies towards employees in the approach of companies to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about co-estimating themselves with the "values" set from the mountain, as it was before, when it was necessary to impose products that came from the ideas of the heads of factory technicians.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution of market mining strategy in the right direction...although authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, return regularly!
The passive approach of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that mainly affects managerial cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI “requires an active approach and ability to anticipate from all stakeholders” and requires commitments from employees that are completely at odds with the revenue of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for a management revolution, which should aim to put workers at the centre of the interest of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to employees of Orange - will contribute to the revolution in managerial procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure after various turns will return to... what it always did!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of its own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of colleges for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of their thought comfort, they acquire an old behavioral theory, currently reinvigorated by “neurscience” from the US and widely disseminated without greater knowledge of the scientific constitution and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the "leaves" (sic) involvement of managers, the recent Ipsos survey showed on the website Figaro.fr, which only confirms the executives in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating the fundamental insight into all the intentions and practices of management : for employees, commitments to the enterprise will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is dealt with only by the study of Motivationally Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined dox that allows them to, through an image that says it says, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these factors of mobilization, managers can control, anticipate and counteract their "social performances" and put their human resources management "on the right path."
This creates a breeding ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
Speech from Oslo: "Just War" Obama earned praise from the right.
The U.S. right welcomed a speech on Friday by Barack Obama delivered the day before in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner defended the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who initially mocked the award to Obama 9. October, this time applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former candidate for vice president in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palinová, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself expressed herself on this topic of "sometimes necessary" wars in her memoes, which are just coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing the Americans would like to have to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessorGeorge W. On Thursday in Oslo, Bush, he justified the deployment of forces and used a speech to clarify his decision to send another 30 000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before.
Obama's next adversary, Newt Gingrich, said the president did a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the president's mention of "existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech entirely historical, Gingrich said during an interview on Radio's "The Takeaway" program.
The former MP, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, were thrilled to see the "left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee's committee that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the Peace Prize if the use of forces did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, former author of George W. Bush, now the editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a "very American speech."
Not only did he present himself as a "world citizen" as always, but he "speaks as an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they themselves did not create, and that they are not doing too much to preserve it," Gerson assessed.
A few discontents from the right include the Bush era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "uniform, pompous and uninspired," as stated on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich, is horrified at the sight of Barack Obama, as he justifies the use of forces.
“When we wrap the war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,” he warned.
However, the medium-left press holds a laudatory position on the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the Peace Prize to Obama to be premature, it assessed its output as "overperformance" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California daily inflamed states.
Obama "he said a speech needed," the New York Times said, calling the speech "small and instructive."
Road hauliers: three marathons to an agreement that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiating marathons, the unions of road hauliers and TLFs, the only employers' organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening, which ended the call for a strike and a threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, at Friday's signing of the deal, expressed "joy" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the discussion, the negotiators broke up early in the morning with the hope that the wording of the agreement would be signed as quickly as possible at the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that the three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostr, OTRE) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took another more than six hours of the meeting, which began at 11 a.m. to all of them to agree and at 18 o'H I agree.
This conflict "would hurt businesses very much" and "a danger of disrupting the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% increase in wages for the lowest salaries (under local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increases from €8.72 to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight, we will order our members to avoid blockades, no blockages of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied, "he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal" even though it was hard to admit a high-salty increase given the international competition ".
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and by 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a deal of common sense and respect for employees, said the Cmaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical deal."
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise."
The agreement also foresees a revalorisation of travel expenditure of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of 100 million euros in corporate salaries" which was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 bill on the 2009 budget, which was voted on on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "consistent" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the entire field, in the event of an extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "in the shortest possible time", Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be hampered by the disagreement of employers' organizations.
FNTR talks about "bad trade" as 100 million euros "has already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation."
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to act not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger the rat's eaters during the approaching Christmas holidays, Unostr complained.
For Otre, the deal threatens to "bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry" in the next 12 months.
Suburban trains RER A: interruption of transport at the weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The interruption of transport on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's negotiations between the unions and the RATP management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the issue of the premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, i.e. days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 a.m. and 20., on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every second train will run, outside this section only one train out of four.
The connection to the SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Galeries Lafayette department stores, which expect more than 200 000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP tried to ensure a connection with large department stores."
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by the RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train in two was in operation at peak times, and virtually no train was running at the time outside the peak, as planned.
As on Thursday, the people of Ile de France had arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station than usual, among other things, because there were no pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old at Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), explained that he rose "an hour and a half early to make sure he was arriving on time."
The Saint-Lazare station was not overcrowded, the SNCF State Railway announced, as a larger number of order-its and guardians of order were foreseeable.
The RER A suburban trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the station Saint-Lazare with a metro connection.
Other general gatherings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the management will be evaluated, which the unions rated as "weak."
The management of the RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban RER A trains in all respects, adjustment of working hours, career course, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who are demanding a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (Odborny Jih).
For now, the RATP has even postponed the proposals for the premium, which offended the CGT, saying that the management "was not able to solve the problem, while for travel carriers and the SNCF it was possible".
At the new meeting, scheduled for Monday, "properly reviewing the conditions of profession," RATP reported.
Which was the reason why unionists think the business is "making a joke about weekend travelers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the company committee at its Paris headquarters.
The management, which has so far refused any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of "reassurance".
There is a risk that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independents report a strike alert.
The unions are asking for a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indendants (Independents)) and make it difficult to deteriorate working conditions on this line, which carries a million passengers a day.
In the more advanced career period, drivers of RU suburban trains earn between 2200 and 2700 euros gross wages and 600 to 650 euros premiums for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and public holidays.
The Turkish judiciary dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision entails severe consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday decided to repeal the country's chief pro-Turd party. This decision immediately sparked protest demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which seeks to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it became "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority of-seven votes were needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres including its president, Ahmet Türk, and MP Aysela Tuglukova, are banned from participating in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the annulance of the parliamentary immunity used by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party leadership warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament rather than act as non-political deputies in it.
The decision is a continuation of the trial launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdhurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political display of PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic connection" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes at a time when the government is lending a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and attempts to limit Kurdish support against the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where many demonstrations have degenerated in recent weeks against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is detained in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a major city in the southeast, which is mostly inhabited by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, protesters threw Molotov cocktails or shot stones from washing slings.
About a hundred people demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict was handed down, Mr. Türk said that the justice decision would only "deplete desperation."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are on principle against the interference of the parties.
It doesn't solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete blast of democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK side, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow may come
Pretty buscher winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the winter technical services department FES.
But so that his staff can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES follows the exact plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt nationwide and temperatures fall below zero, they will run out to 20 so-called sections A large-scale spreaders, Brauburger explains.
These sections include main and driveways such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with descents like Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three o'CL A.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with wet salt within a maximum of three hours, which better holds, about 1040 kilometers.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock at night "to make the road free when traffic to work begins."
It's hard when it starts to snow only at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, "since no one is willing to make a place for the spreaders."
Only when it doesn't snow so much is the arrival and interconnection communications, which also include Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're going to complain there.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES infantrymen go on the road, preferably cleaning dangerous places and crossings.
FES usually can't take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which monitors bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As the iceberg is formed quickly on them, the spreader immediately as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will call them.
The Rubble of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high run on two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelimbs with sickle-like claws and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, it would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the issue of Science on Thursday write that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in the Equatorial dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to earlier dinosaur evolution, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about kinship, spreads and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began with excavations in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, it is unprecedented for sediments from the trias, reports Randall Irmis team member of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavators, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The finding confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god Hopi.
For Sterlinga Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "The fossils of dinosaurs from the trias are very rare, mostly only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
In the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when the loyders divided into the three most important development lines: carnivores theropods, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, "long-bloothed" sauropods and their relatives, and the Herbivores of Ornithischia (bird digger), which included, for example, the species Triceratops.
Tawa hallae is the original terrace after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced qualities, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found, for example, evidence of air sacs, which even the descendants of the thunderops have birds.
Thanks to the air bags, breathing of birds is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive thunderpod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation was probably already the common ancestor of both groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs still known so far lived in South America, scientists declared that lizards had first appeared there.
According to this, three lines of development were soon split and spread from South America to all continents that formed a single Earth mass as a supercontinent of Pangea.
She would also speak for the fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three of them can't come from a single, mixed ancestor, scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of heaviest dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bondonian paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could put together a distorted image, as very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved in South America, with the rare when they are rarely found on other continents.
As the dinosaurs proved that from the relatively rare secondary line of the reptiles to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the time of the Earth's Middle Ages, it still remains a riddle.
During the triasse, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
At about the end of the trias, dinosaurs spread all over the world and many new species have evolved, while relatives died out and the interface of the trias and the jury.
The history of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that dinosaurs accidentally survived, but reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could push the competition out.
The history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, the impact of a meteorite helped another group of animals, which also evolved into a trias and has lived in the shade since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors at the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna and Berkeley, California.
Associated with associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University took care of the worldwide uproar.
278 professors and teachers of Goethe universities, but also colleges across Germany, Europe and North and South America, solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "don't approve" the presidium-enforced police intervention.
Because the walls and works of art were scriung, university President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied last week by striking students and speakers.
Five students were injured.
Damage to the case, judges by signatories, do not justify "violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teaching police commandos."
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
The solemn focus on vandalism serves to "unjustifi and criminalize the protest" and distract from the contents.
The Presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The speakers call for the cessation of criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support substantible damage.
Justified protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi’s secretive Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hesse Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and cast are utterly unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbab National Assembly.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no sympathy for vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a member of the country's parliament for the CDU.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it.
The CDU takes the painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there was evacuation.
Linke has filed a motion calling on the Interior Minister to report on police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, it has been paid for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a top-of-court site where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district with 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the Moscow center, is considered to be "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers.
Since September 2008, Zelenograd representatives have established contacts with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed a "Protocol of close cooperation" in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's deputy mayor Yuri Rosljak and the prefect from Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, for Frankfurt signed by the head of planning officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ's companies will be allowed to take hold on to the growing Russian market.
Russian scientific companies, on the other hand, want to find contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaya Elektronika.
The county was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literary translation of the "Green City") has acquired its name from the forested hilly landscape into which research facilities are set.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be sufficiently prepared.
For supporters of the project, this is simply the "new heart of Europe".
Okay. The S21 is more than the launch of the railway station, more than a monstrous building that plunges the capital of Baden-Württemberg for one decade into desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
The head stations with the tracks that ended in the city center were then considered to be traffic-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as a brake on modern rail transport, because it was necessary enormously a lot of time to switch locomotives from behind forward.
Go for a break, go on, go on - that's how it should work.
And that's why the headquarters are disappearing: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a drive-through station that lies about halfway through the route of the trans-European railway highway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan about the "heart of Europe".
It really starts with the S21, although visions from the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves have recognized that the start of construction is almost unfundable in the Hesse and Bavarian cities.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, head stations no longer have problems with driving and going.
Still, it starts with Stuttgart 21, including the new ICE to Ulm.
This was done by the land and municipal politicians.
The railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Czech Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not the state concern.
Urbanistically, the project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will emerge that - if we trust the computer images of the designers - will contain much green.
For the railway transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passage railway station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 80's - attributed a huge increase.
Back then, there was no competition of cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must be primarily about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than truck on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
Even more serious is that the S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts consider it a real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other nodal points and narrow places in the network.
There are sixty larger projects on the Ministry of Transport list.
One of the most important is the construction of a roughly 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been underway on this route at a slow motion.
It would be necessary to push properly here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The track through the Rhine Valley will become the neck of a bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines airport verdict
The provincial government has left it open in the Wiesbabanka State assembly to go against the judgment of the Hesse of the Hesse Court (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and will have it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally assess the VGH's 400-page ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today justified in writing that the state would have to newly adjust the night ban on flights in the event of the construction of the planned northwestern runway of Frankfurt Airport.
Authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the provincial government, does not correspond to the law-ordered protection of the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 if it will demand a revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and arrived at the government's representatives to renounce a revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel has called on the CDU and the FDP to return to promises to ban night flights she had given before the election. Otherwise, this can be assessed as a "violation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP's election slogan "We keep the word."
Minister Posch has rejected the rebuyment of Schäfer-Gümbel, the provincial government is trying to get to its night flights through "overhand over rights and tricks".
Accurate legal control needs its time.
The Coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "fast first impression."
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction's statements to ban night flights have never been what the opposition puts them.
U.S. banks pay for aid
American, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America repaid $45 billion in aid from the Tarp Banking Fund on Wednesday.
According to a report by CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay state aid.
The institutions thus want to get rid of the restrictions that have occurred by accepting money - limiting the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has made $19 billion in net money with investors thanks to convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the amount from her cash register, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trade union sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis explicitly thanked the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday: A cash injection helped us overcome difficult times.
The monetary institution has hurt itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by procuring money on the capital market.
CNBC reported, citing sources, that the U.S. bank could announce a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid the aid in June.
Quick choice
It was faster than expected.
The station unveiled the successor just two weeks after the ZDF board pushed out of the office of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the board wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital in Berlin, was described as the favorite.
But the station did not confirm this - officially, to avoid the process.
But the role may have also been played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if this proposal did not pass to the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not known before the closing date of this release.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brennder's loss of the mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although to be expected.
The EU majority on the board of directors had already signaled several weeks before the election that they do not want to confirm Brender in office.
Resistance to the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hesse Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused further remaining in the office of the highly esteemed editor by arguing that the ZDF news surveillance quotas have fallen under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, the protests were therefore in which political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
The last time, 35 state-law lawyers who rate Koch's actions as unconstitutional were involved in the debate.
It wasn't for nothing.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957, in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romani studies.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey went to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal officer editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 lead and moderator "Morgenmagazins"; to 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then the head of the ZDF main studio.
After Brennder, who was elected a paper-experienced Medium Magazin journalist of the year on Wednesday, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's anti-candidate on the board of directors, Rhyinist-Palceiant Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that federal states should change the state treaty with the ZDF so that the personnel proposals of the intender could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brennder's supposed successor, Peter Frey, commanded the board with a clever chess move - promptly after the deposition of Brender, he strongly criticized the board for it.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate him in the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, both by Schächter and could have been elected by the board without compromising the party to push into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is somehow ranked among the left-wing liberals.
Studying Rids the Handgrade
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, the ministers of culture finally went to the federal states on Thursday: At the conference of Ministers of Culture and University Rectors, both sides agreed that it is the will to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the stress of the exam: In principle, each study module should be completed by one single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students should be checked and the "real and defaiable measure" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal States undertake to create a more flexible common structural assignment for bachelor’s and master’s degree programmes.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less trials
Since the start of student protests in the worm, the ministers of culture and university rectors have had winged words about better study in their mouths.
Now they are filled with specific content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided that the number of examinations will be partially drastically reduced: "Each module will usually be completed by only one test", reads the 30-page report, which is partly intended to regulate the approval of study fields.
"Significantly lower exam burden," said the chairman of the Accreditation Board, Reinhold Grimm, "wasting a misconception that significantly reduced the difficulty of studying."
To do this, the "difficultness of the study" in the future should be a "decisive criterion" in implementation.
Modules and contents "must be closely checked" so that "unnecessarily restrict students in the choice
seminars."
Students would be entitled to a space that allows and supports their own initiative.
The rules are to apply when approving new fields of study, but also for existing fields of study after review.
These need to be "re-accredited" every five years - which means that it will last until 2015 for all fields of study to be reviewed.
There are ten accreditation agencies that are subject to the accreditation boards set up by the Länder established by the Länder.
In October, the culture ministers called on the Federal States to act on the agencies in such a way that the content of the curriculum was not too large and the examination regime was not strict.
In individual Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the provincial ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, the Rhineland-Paalco has pledged additional resources for the further development of the Bologna Process.
From the money, universities should primarily pay for consultation programmes and study counseling, and strengthen the testing and foreign authorities.
For this, countries and universities want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to parliament.
According to her, only one exam should be required for the completion of the study module.
The formation of studies should be even more flexible, for this purpose should be guaranteed the recognition of examinations from other universities and making the access of a master easier.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all fields of study in the country should be checked.
The government and the opposition again argued on the country's study conditions on Thursday.
In addition to the praise, criticism of the resolution was also criticized.
The Federal Board of Directors of the Juso Higher Education Groups called for the creation of education policy not to take place in the future "by the closed door" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, at least a word, students as concerned should "at least speak a word" as a person concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the conference of university rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the culture ministers, with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bond resolutions did not go far enough: They demand a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access the superstructure master’s degree.
Second, the federal states must ensure that for today's generation of undergraduate students, there are enough seats available in master's degrees with the best possible teaching conditions tomorrow, GEW board member Andreas Keller said.
The Federal States must employ far more speakers.
But the ministers of culture did not comment on the free access to the master's programmes.
More than a footnoxus to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, who in this torn language piece thematizes the experience of a one dissident who gained freedom, but at the same time lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first working as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and later as a lecturer as a lecturer of a children's book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary prizes, 1993 he gave poetry at the legendary Frankfurt University of Goethe, and since 2002 he is the head of the Hessian Forum of Literature in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
A significant extra-literary commotion was taken up by last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which included "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security act".
Clearly indestined and slapped Söllner left a statement in which, among others, in front of fellow writers by the Romanian Germans, among others. Richard Wagner, William Totoko, Franz Hodak and Helmut Frauendorfer, admits to cooperation as a secret informator of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner won the German language prize in 1989.
Attempts at recruiting began inconspicuously, at the earliest in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, "that is, someone who did not resist sufficiently attempts to intimidate on the part of Securitate."
Poetry Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her, the unparalleled literary settlement of the mechanisms of the dictatorial government is the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors coming from Romania, shaken by a case that marks the depths and infamy of the political system based on control and spitz.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but is also a victim.
In the acts of Securitate, the secret agent Walter played a role, said Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive influence on himself by the secret agent Walter.
He was booing me at the time at all essential points, says Markel.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
In this form and before this audience, Söllner’s statement was not an unexpected but absolutely surprising confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote in July when she read her own acts, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Spitzles of Securitate.
The attendance, it can be assumed, they will speculate and in some cases probably know which name is behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Other than in the domestic, meanwhile, already very certain examination of the Stazi components, the manipulation of the estate of the Securitate control is still very diffusion.
In recent years, systematic education has been obscured and restricted.
One of the Birthler authorities, which corresponds to the National Council for the processing of the components of Securitate (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the publication of the act has been rather lengthy ever since.
Only since 2005 has there been a law that governs the administration of the components.
After the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, former members of Securitate still have a great influence in Romania, in which one of the former Securitate chiefs of Temešvár expressed his refusal to the award winner.
She has psychosis, after all, she was only questioned once.
The disgrace of power here was completely open in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as in the context of the withheld offense, has the inevitable questions.
Why now? Who was harmed? The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession is to expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than for the sake of guilt and shame.
The genesis of Herta Müller's work, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Saturated Champions League deposit
It looked as if a cleanly dressed sales representative came from a cute Christmas party at which the manufacturer of sporting goods was handing out a sweets, when he boarded a quarter of an hour after midnight to the called class C Mercedes, the new coach VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored sack of a sponsor. ̈ ̈
A man with a prominent baldness had him driven around a foreign city.
Otherwise, he could drive alone - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with happiness, the 55-year-old man was also not enough.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow will go on to work.
Or it's just starting.
In words, only three days of the Swiss engaged: "We have reached the eight-final", in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzling by success: It will be a brutally tough fight against relegation."
"A far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance from the royal class in Mainz even on an ordinary league day.
And to prevent the obvious weaknesses of the three quick goals of Marica (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyaka (11th).
Drawing
Eighth finals of the Champions League (flight 16./17. + 23/24 February/ rematch 9./10. + 16/17 March) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of the shattering rise of Babbel's successor will therefore be preserved.
Not only with the supposed healer, who gave the uncertain Stuttgart professionals a short self-confidence, a willingness to put and the joy of play within a short period of time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be bolder, explained the soul healer Gross such a simply-sounding successful recipe, which, however, under the action of therapist Babbel, proved no more effectiveness.
He swore a certain magic, Babbel's adherent Jens Lehmann admitted, "when there is a new impulse in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a long break caused by an injury for many weeks, became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "family" proverbial "fresh wind" and the working practices of the new superior: "It is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
It was obviously missing under Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, even players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened replacement and utterly overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after a 0:4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sporting chairman Horst Heldt recalled that although one goal in the season was reached, the other is still far away.
We're not behind the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home victory after three months was due to weekend events that came to life freshly in the form of a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt replied to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He threw the board of directors weak leadership and decided to change the coach after pressure from teenage fans.
Even the fact that his day off after the matches was canceled, Lehmann described as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formuls pure egoism," Heldt replied and announced the consequences for goalkeepers.
The two forties will probably no longer be happy with life.
Anyway, they are for one with others that without the work of a deposed coaching team it would not be possible to play a strong and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "big part of success," Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man agrees with the plastic bag.
Clash of the World Heavyweight Championships
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked with words and gestures of world champion Vitaly Klitschko.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title of the boxing organization WBC.
The referee's statement was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains the world champion in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson in Bern on Saturday night in Berne unanimously on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, this is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was twice the WBO and WBC world champion.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out k.o., which everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice being beaten due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th round.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bern arena, the 2.02-meter-high Klitschko was driven by a fight mainly with his left-hander.
Eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who before the duel announced the end of Klitschko's era, was withdrawing from the strokes of the world champion, so Klitschko could not push the decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
In total, passive Johnson did quite a little on the challenger and tried to just get into the next rounds.
Klitschko provoked with words and gestures, but his strokes rarely hit the world champion.
But even so, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klitschko for twelve rounds.
Before the duel, the challenger took care of a stir in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klička as a "resporting zombie" that "doesn't know anything properly."
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champagne was provoked, he withdrew from Johnson's nose sunglasses "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitschko stayed after the fourth duel after his return 11. October 2008 undefeated.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his "his" WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight before.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba's title in defense of the title and Chris Arreol of the United States in September.
In this fight I got only one blow and physically in good shape, Klitschko justified a quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the WBO and IBF world champion.
But the WBA belt is worn by Briton David Haye, after he fell from the throne of Nikolai Vulayev, 2.1.1 meters high in November.
Haye rescinded a duel against Klitschko in the summer, scheduled for September.
He is reportedly planning a duel against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Case Of Kunduz
Leading attack from the opposition: The head of the Greens faction, Jürgen Trittin, called the defense minister Guttenberg a liar because of the bad information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Levie) call on the chancellor to give an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed conscious deception.
The minister said "consciously untrue" to the deadly bombing of the two tankers in September, said the head of the Greens faction Jürgen Trittin on Saturday's news show ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual word: Lick.
The order for the killing was issued in disregarding the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg had, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not only the destruction of the abducted trucks, but the deliberate killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. airstrike, which was demanded by German commander Kunduz, Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to NATO investigation.
The Greens, the SPD and Linke called on the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to comment immediately before the Bundestag, as well as clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Ms Merkel must explain whether targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan Parliament's federal council - and, whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleagues Renate Künast have called for it.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office does not affect the concrete deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the ministry's trial of the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert also spoke out loud.
According to SPIEGEL, both of the two Guttenberg reported correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tankers.
It was officially said that they should deny the existence of NATO reports and conceal sensitive details from the minister.
However, it was said from the vicinity of both top officials that they even drew attention to several reports, among them a two-page document of the commanding Colonel Klein and one report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have asked in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that it has not received any response yet.
The ministry did not comment on the reproach on Saturday, pointing out that this will be dealt with in the investigative committee of the Bundestag, which will be established next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in the waiver state and hear voices that others can’t see and can’t hear.
Not only mentally ill or in drug intoxication, the boundaries between imagination and reality merge.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with the wildest imaginations and fanciful mirage.
But those who experience dreamy states in vigilance see and hear things that others do not see and hear, in today’s Western world, pay mostly as a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a weirdo.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels, they will take care of the boundaries between dreams, imagination and reality.
Dreams altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst delusion.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the vision of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of derogation, psychoses and hallucinations can derive from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise if the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain occurs - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is canceled.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity over him has no power
The connection between delusions and dreams employed philosophers and doctors from antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of a dream in a waxy state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "a great reluctance to ramaculate with dream states", for Sigmund Freud was even a dream "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusion, misdece" of senses.
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and gaudy colored.
Gravity over it has no power, it floats at the ceiling of the room.
He feels kicked.
Behind him, winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, penning teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery shoes, throwing it against the walls, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from walls and radio.
He can no longer put up with voices that scolding and insulting him.
Henning T. pulls two cables off the stereo, knocks them in a loop and fixes it on the hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one loudspeaker and puts a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop looses.
Be careful, they're yelling chorus voices tearing his drums, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today is Henningu T. 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychoses, the last 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSDs were launched.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoic psychosis, besides that, he is manic-depressant, he takes drugs against depression, maniness, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people get at least once in their lives schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is the most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, affecteds can usually no longer distinguish between the internal and the outer world, they are put into an over-excessed state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relational illusions or the illusion of persecution.
A hearing of votes in particular is a close-numbering - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is not able to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out the intrusive signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis of the floodgate opens up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is located in the center of the action, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, it becomes, as in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible, ghosts are a terrible fact, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucination
Other than in a dream, Fuchss says, "the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience occurs in a real frame.
Scientists are still in front of a riddle of why exactly our brain makes such phemes.
Exceptional states can lead everyone to lose their relationship to reality in the short term, Fuchs says.
Not everyone develops into psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that affected people have minimal brain damage.
We believe that at an early stage of development, neuronal maturation of the brain, such as the viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a riddle of how the neuronal system breaks, which has not manifested itself in it for many years.
The influences of the environment also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be an initiator of psychosis, if there is a disposition to it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain boils
Crazy is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive mirage as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (Unrealistine World in Our Head).
Hallucinations are one of the typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or cerebral trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain itself is hallucinated by the brain of a healthy person.
The hallucinations, according to Kasteno, consist of content of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or little suppressed; if our brain is boiled, or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries with love or other other exceptional states.
In more recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported that they had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. For 16 years, he has lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Housefin and goes to the local grammar school.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If there weren't those shapes and voices.
At breaks, it can happen that she is approached by a roundabout with long, dark hair.
When he answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her sees and doesn't hear this boy.
This shy girl is considered an uptight dreamer, but Sarah K. does not eat, she knows.
He's awake, hearing and seeing the boy, just as he hears and sees a girl sitting next to him in a pew.
It can even feel its presence, at least for a few moments.
She feels good, she likes this boy.
I'm crazy?, he asks sometimes.
But he knows this boy and other delusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather daunting
Often, mirage is a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, he can’t watch teaching many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else audibly and visibly on the tabule of the mathematical equation.
At night, the appearances are rather depressing.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is rarely coming, and too late, she can often tell if she is awake or whether she is already asleep, whether the images she sees, the grims, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and legs, are formed in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, screaming at those characters.
She doesn't say anything to her parents and friends about it, they'd think she's gone crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated from graduation last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations ceased.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten online, she knows exactly that she hasn't gone crazy.
Delusions are also an art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or stimulus is taken away from him, he will most likely have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain does not have enough jobs and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., the only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, she often played on her own.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that a man she told her father since she thought she was not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds are active, it is difficult for those affected as Sarah K. to distinguish delusions and reality from each other. "Every experience," says Kassten, "it takes place in the brain, and reality is also depicted there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to arise, so they act so real."
Also, night dreams are evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people does not differ fundamentally from hallucination in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises its patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
In our world concentrated too much on the knowledge, the imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief medical officer of the Psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, torance of suffering, but it also brings positives, creativity - a mirage is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined the so-called theovirus form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness to the dream.
The oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the person concerned considers real and can not even distinguish them retrospectively from the alert state.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation, who experience full knowledge of motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps lasting, the complete inability to move, replaces the life-threatening real situation with one’s own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
Type of border condition between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to manage a situation in reality, there will be a change in the worlds, but the real situation will come into the imagination.
An intense form of support for the senses and transferring the senses in some unbearable situation that allows us people to be able to shape themselves, to move in an instant into the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his individualoid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Herzwechsel) as a life-saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness embarked on a several-day journey, with his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into the world he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man who was bedridden, in a train sanatorium, the robot guards his health.
It lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility that produces narcotic substances from the blood.
On a motorcycle, the Greek kidnaps him into his homeland, surfing the company in the Alps on a hospital bed and meets a Korean mobster.
It sinks completely into the imaginary process, everything is real, and later in memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Clauses from any dream.
Dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, memories of those mental pathways are still clearly clear after years and in insignificant details.
Even brighter and more intense than a real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show the heiroid states, psychoses, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile even in the waking state our internal images of external reality are.
Every change in the state of consciousness is summed up by psychologist Kasten, "can lead to distortion of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be rewarding.
Snow may come
Burda
At 27 to take over children
The new head of the publishing house, Kallen, is a transitional solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding is also supposed to belong to the family 100 percent in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda has long seen his business in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old man of SPIEGEL.
We have carefully dealt with the details.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked only after that.
The question of whether they have the skills to do it.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees of their children at the fore if they are not sufficiently capable.
That would kill both children and business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the chairmanship of the board of directors since January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Department of Cashier, responsibility for the company’s assets was added, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s withdrawal, Direct Marketing, Foreign, Print and Finance were also added.
For the first time, no family members are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would have been 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallena's appointment also serves to "spanit 10, 15 years," Burda said.
The holding should belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda says.
In light of the Schickedenz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not sure before the demise: "It has always affected companies that have allowed themselves to be infected by the desire for capital they speculated and thought that might become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams about world power," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time," these deals are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming and this is a time when it is advisable to find out what celebrities wear and adapt your festive wardrobe to it.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which is necessary to be aware.
We present several proposals.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We don't recommend.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona town hall, founded the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote an electric car in the capital, Catalonia.
The LIVE’ (Logistics for the Introduction of Electric Vehicles) will set out and manage the travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and ensure mobility agreements, will handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the projectMOVÉ, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the purpose is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city involved in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are the three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVEE Plan to support the introduction of electric vehicles.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with the participation of Endesa in terms of promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or VERDE CENIT.
Zapatero foresees a 'calm period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish car industry, the main export sector of the state, awaits a "resting period".
In the economic report of the Prime Minister for 2009, Zapatero summed up the measures introduced during the year in support of the automotive sector.
“Without the Competitive Plan for the Automotive Sector, we would have a state of abandonments today, the closure of some of our major manufacturing companies,” he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the wishes of individual brands, it continues to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm for this industry is expected in the future, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he noted that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), has identified 800 million for projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary firms that mobilized an investment exceeding EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to support the demand and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being applied in cooperation with autonomous regions and car brands.
According to the president, this plan made it possible to reduce the average emissions level for new vehicles sold in the Spanish market by 6% and ensured a "significal increase" of entries, namely by "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Vehicle Salon will be opened in Madrid, a space for meeting both professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place on days 5. - 7. February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of Madrid Casa de Campo.

Mazda3 i-Stop: preserving the sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative effect on the sporting style.
And that's why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start-of-engine system - baptized also as-Stop-, a device that is currently only available with a 2.0 150-horsepower gasoline engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop...
All these aspects are excellent in Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver's seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
Using a tool and console assembly, we conclude that Mazda continues its Japanese trend in the development of futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us of the style that also presents by the Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, in particular, even more with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention the large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
So far, the automatic stop and start-up system is available only with a gasoline engine for two litres and 150 horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise levels, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most popular Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive as many miles a year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater comfort when driving and reduced consumption.
In terms of equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For serial equipment, it is necessary to mention the lane-tracking system (RVM), which prevents the appearance of blind spot, stroke control and stability, the internal light-sensitive mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels made of 17-inch alloy.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an additional cost of 1,500 euros: adaptable lights two-xener and BOSE sound system with CD holder, in addition to other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more kilometers per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a gasoline engine of 2.0 and 150 hp.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is 21,770 euros for the Luxury version and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sport-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L. A. has a red carpet, soft as hands Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the brand'Nine'. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'lady'.
The promise of Fon Peek
Peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view mail, without the ability to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine awarded him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing him outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, for which, however, it is necessary to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
Fon Peek, which was presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is a European version of the invention and its third transformation.
He is limited as his American counterpart, but brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or eagerly search for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) to inspect the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to read the tiny letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that it continues to have the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) means that operators start to think differently and consider various offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and more Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is paid at purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen in the case ofFonPeek, it's the possibility of buying with a permanent approach like Peek has already been in place in the U.S.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it is the best type from the consumer's point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color that Michelle is adored
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady USA.
To take Barack Obama as president of the United States, she chose a dress and a coat in this color, and she chose the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with glittering effects-, in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, the first lady of the United States seemed to choose to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The substance from which the clothes are made make make both models considerably different.
On the occasion of taking up the post of Michelle, she used a large lace in Oslo velvet with a print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with medium-high heel, now a similar model, but in gold color.
He also wears various hairstyles: this time the draggle, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have maternity-related work problems.
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger years who intend to get a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fameth and Career of Spanish Women's Women's Study, conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market due to motherhood.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of cohabitation there are many differences in the opinion of the number of children according to whether or not they work, and also by type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, begin to live with a partner earlier, earlier give birth to their first child and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, postpone cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
“Women from 35 to 49 years of age with stable employment have the first child on average 3.7 years since cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have devoted more part of their lives to the achievement of their stable employment and therefore had to postpone the cohabitation of children.
The type of profession also has a strong effect on motherhood, although less influence on the time of commencement of cohabitation with a partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is engaged in research at CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage anoradiation of the offspring is the degree of education.
The research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49 years, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 or. 32.1.
"There is yet another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education are getting married and giving birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or high education are doing the opposite priority to get a stable job, before marriage and the birth of their first child," Delgado said.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal motto 'Because I am worth it'.
The 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant international-grade actresses, joins other famous personalities of L'Oréal Paris, such as. Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Falsday') and Freida Pinto ('Milionist from the Hut' entered this selected club.'
The men's part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin' partner in 'Lost').
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to talk about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, both earlier and present - met for the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, on the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
Manuel Vicenta Poker
Manuel Vicecent will donate thirty X-rays of writers in 'Ax poker' (Alfaguara, illustration of Fernando Vicente) to whom he met in his literary life (and, in some cases, in everyday life).
It does not do so in the dreaded and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but is looking for something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicen does not spare any scare or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading pleasure, even with repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
Albert Camus: “On the pages of this book, I have found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, as much as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoy of a counter-favorite, a morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.”
“A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not an intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, meaningless as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him.”
About Graham Green: "Our man has been shrouded in passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege for reaching heaven by the way of damning."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand-dollar peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the northern side, from which the best climbers often collapse."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange person.
He himself said of himself that he was the heir to a farmer from the county, other times he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, they were great dreams.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured on the bridge the deranged cry of this man from Munich to bring his echo into the night of the 20th century in its literary form, fleeing from himself and calling for the future and speaking violently to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: “Once she knelt and prayed: ‘My beloved God, make me stop writing as a woman.’”
About Joseph Conrad: "Spenser's verses were engraved on his grave: 'After the effort comes a dream,/ after a thunderstorm a quiet port,/after the war rest,/after a full life death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage he also carried his depression.
The husband completely agreed to tell him that Edward VII followed her between the assailants or that the birds were singing Greek.
Never before have a man been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with folly.”
About Pio Baroja: "What else was it about Martín Santos than to target Joyce on Baroja?
What else was Benet's point than having Baroya executed Faulkner's gun?
What else was Cel's worth than to make oneself to the famous at the expense of the man's fame?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood, in the Fuenlabrady district, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 went through the thrush and our dog, a crossed rescued from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, without a word he was twice kicked in and severely injured.
Our indignation is all the greater because we don’t see anything fun in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was on a leash.
And on top of that, the old lady's shock after this incident, when she clashed with these individuals on a walk, she began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil-obsessed person who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old person or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog weeped all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint with the nearest commissary, but we doubt it was for something, and in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Indignant has prompted us to report this fact.
We do not understand what happens to today's youth when they are amused by the fact that it suffers from a defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not understand where the right behavior, respect for animals and humans has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using helmets
Tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, mainly with younger motorists, as both subjects reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of using the helmet, as this is the only means to prevent head injuries or deaths in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of their transport safety commitments, which "means more than designing and producing even safer products," and has confirmed that it seeks to fulfil this purpose in the form of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of a helmet while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first stage where there will be signs of more than 500 motorcycle repairs to make it known to the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that traffic safety "is a constant problem" of this company, which is a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main goal is to continuously increase product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more, these are the first increase in 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures from the patronage organization of Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam dealers.
However, it is better to quarantine the positive figure, as November 2008 is a bad time for comparison and meant a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles applied for in the last 11 months accounts for 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January,958,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pickups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/chassis.
And the smash, which most damages demand, even when they were bought by private individuals, most purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies, and in total 100% of the cases it is financing through third parties.
Other factors such as cessation of an activity or continuation of the poor economic situation should be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In the given situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the purchase of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention ionesses doing business licenses of small and medium-sized companies, which intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded again that it is necessary to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles, as well as industrial vehicles (cubes and buses).
The Association of Sellers expects that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and, according to calculations, sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the handbrake is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock braking system, it will also be with ESP stability control, the helper of the handbrake, all this will become mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, it already forms part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the other is set a deadline for the elimination of the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measures put in place in the EU aim to increase pedestrian protection, while operating in a way that it can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary handbrake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency case, which the system detects after the driver is depressed.
But it can't always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the car parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident did not stop the brake from the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the brake force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the braking system, shortens the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 fatal accidents per year could be avoided.
Reducing this number will be even more pronounced-according to calculations would prevent one of the four accidents with the impact on the person-after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using a radar or camera) will capture obstacles and report them to the driver, in addition to light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if needed.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device impresses as intensively as possible to the brake and reduces the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, to Opel employees at Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April -probably on April 8 - as reported by Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for the Opel.
Nick Reilly, GM Europe's new president, is trying to make every point of the plan first agreed with the party involved.
And as a result, the final document, which will be first submitted to the staff and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production facilities is based, may be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken in these days.
Not surprisingly, the Swedish government has increased pressure on U.S. manufacturers to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM enables contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper operating under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of the assets of Saab to Chinese company Baic.
It is still valid to close Saab at the end of the year if it fails to sell it.
Driving with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
On the basis, first of all, the automatic drawstring roof is in a canvas with manual control, reducing the weight by 21 kg; furthermore, aluminum doors were used, such as. GT3, which means an additional 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to the reduction of weight by an additional 7 kg; after mounting sports seats another 12 kg,thanks lightened 19-inch wheels another five kilos.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means an additional six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means an additional kilogram.
It is also offered with a dual-clutch PDK transmission, one vehicle with a hand-shifted six-speed speed box has been tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, mountain sections with many intricate corners.
His behavior can only be classified as inviolable.
Reducing weight does not mean that the vehicle is not printed to the asphalt.
Rather, on the contrary, we have not tested such a small and light model for a long time, which would also carry such safety when moving in the corner, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete capable of warming up the muscles during a short drive for the necessary time until we order him to sprint, braking, and restore the engine use...
Whatever we want. Thanks to the steering, which is as communicative as accurate, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound according to the will
The sound of the V6 boxer, 320 hp (about 10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced by the option of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that has previously been used in Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether when sucking or recuperating.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we drive through with the Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and in some corners we came across at dawn on icing and gravel even on an advanced morning.
Definitely this ultra-light car is one of the most entertaining on the market, as it is a bit more than the Merry Boxster S modification.

Baskonia Awarded Victory in Israel
She won a brilliant victory in 82-91 during her hosting on the complicated Maccabi Electra course, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus she got to the head of her group after a big performance by Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triple points was announced for the best in the team (29 ratings).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer to an end to win.
In addition, the great precision from the 16 triple points circuit contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match began with a headlong for the blue, who from the beginning stood on the mark.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already suggesting that they attacked the Israeli squad very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main scorers 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava team opted for the inner game of Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by whistling and applause when returning to its original location to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to show itself as the best in his team with 13 points, although without six in Splitter's rating already suggested that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the macabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'by Elias' they could win.
Eidson and Pnini have definitely contributed to the 'yellow' to return to the limelight (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, injured but not dead at all, needed several accurate games to catch their breath, and then the Mirza Teletovic machine gun appeared, which three-seater almost in a row and with the help of Englishe and Ribbas returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which the locals reached at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaws have skinned in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to deprive them of the well-deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their squad, did not give up and tried to keep the squad alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter, who was ruled out for the seIvanovic foul, they did not hesitate and defend well, and although the Israelis came close to the final minute (80-85), the match already had the winner aTel Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos and left him the lead of Group B in the Euroleague in a match marked with three attacks from the side of the Unitedias, but above all by the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team did not scare the environment of the Hall of Peace and Friendship or the opponent, perhaps one of the more sick in Europe, and with a big budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusan to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, lit up the pitch with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity ofUiciaya, although the arsenal of the locals in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score of 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the supporters of USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to function and showed its advantage in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to an injury to Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez were burdened by the Unicaja team
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with triple points, they increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible retaliation
The third part was very offensive from the side of Olympiacos, which, although losing by 19, proved the superiority and even managed to equal the difference from the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unianaya tried to overcome the absences and the last absence of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja, thanks to the lead and three-point points of Cook and Lewis's contribution, she left a certain hope for a win of 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to strengthening and superiority in centimeters in its zone, proved that it was unstopfightable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalize the bazacket of the average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja withered and handed the lead to Olympiacos.

Brazil sets out the date of Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for remaining Manuel Zelay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The Deposed President must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his term officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, the chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been hiding since September 21.
“He is aware that he must leave on 27 January after his mandate is over and seek another refuge.”
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before a set deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum sought to be imposed on him by the government "de facto", chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the predominated mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in an environment where executives take decisions about a future that is insecure in itself.
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the market was the asset of the debt by directly buying assets and indirectly easing liquidity in a zero course so that financial institutions could buy assets to deduct.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have already come virtually over and, without questioning their disparate liquidity policy, are starting to throw a little sand into the gears, as the Spanish Bank of Spain did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic resumption without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in the return of the reduction in risky returns.
The monetary and gender bond differences have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Again, they are pushing for quality, and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for the investors elected, expanding the differentiation of eurozone countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost not affected by this instability, but at that time the Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the Kingdom of Spain's qualification.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not unhelpful to silence advocates of moral risk, who once again sought to burden the conscience of those responsible for world economic policy because of the hindrance of the devastating consequences of limiting the recovery of employment credit, when in fact it would be necessary to declare a new Thanksgiving day.
However, the situation in Dubai represents the tribal struggles between the emirs to restore power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers deficits, elections and a new government is taking on.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to bail out Hungary before non-fulfilment of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member country not to meet its obligations.
But what makes sense is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to transparency and to oblige its own citizens to account for common responsibility in the need for emergency measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expected, we are before the period of normalisation of the transitional premium, after some excesses in supported positions would be within the expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt gap will increase the same as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European disparities are reduced and ours continue to expand, it would be a typically Spanish risk.
The issue of Standard & Poor's is just an anecododon. When our leading indicators force most studio services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 upward scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not give a great hope of living this warning for the Spanish economy.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "cautiously, buddy to the driver".

Iberdol President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy is debated in the next two decades these days.
Following his intervention, followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán provided the press with a few remarks on the proposal, which he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdol, Spain needs an investment of 50,000m million euros by 2020 and an additional $60,000 million from this date by 2030 if nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this does not happen, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola actually believes that in the next decade investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but of distribution networks and international interconnections
From 2020, the issue has changed and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas plants and coal-fired power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes the bill on a sustainable economy just passed by the government, corresponds to the line that the company demanded, did not want to let the veins as a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, "a clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite "precision" measures as President Iberdola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be adopted now, because their maturation continues and a stable tax framework is necessary for their launch.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary Ferrovial for airport ground services, the Swiss porter, will play the role of a preferential partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cost services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet expired, has been valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed the cooperation protocol to create a smart infrastructure innovation centre
The association expects an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which is in Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the research of energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water business.
The construction, which is underway, is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,077 million euros).
Her rivals are the French business Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5-kilometre tunnel in Brisbane, Australia, on the East Coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in this country as a construction and concession highway.
The town hall wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting a public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initials in English) for further development of the project in the business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the administration already has the final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
Offers are expected to be presented in May, and the projected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (€1.047 million) and in the last phase of competitions three companies with a significant presence in European construction sites.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Accion, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies, and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
Against the Accion Group, Northern Direct is in play with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which passed through the sieve, is called LBJV and is involved in the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the construction company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), also the local Baulderstone (property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a major company specialized in civil constructions Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction and privatization, but it carries a clear difficulty of entry in a way other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the Hochtief or Bilfinger is, in addition to Asian references, still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has gained a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton quoted.
Million-dollar assets
Acciona is relying on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activities of the energy supplier and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of businesses that build and manage Salting facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The underground road subject to toll, promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructures Office, called the Northern Link, is to connect the western highway from Toowong with the circular route in Kelvin Grove (see map) of 5 kilometers of tunnel. It is the largest event to reduce Brisbane’s traffic congestion.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to enter for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid pass would open in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to be projected in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars ($308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract Hochtief
Australia still delivers a significant profit, as it announced a contract with the government estimated at $154 million yesterday.
Share-funded ACS will put the infrastructure of the national network of the broad band with fiber-optic cable through its local Leighton filing.
This situation will allow quick access to the Internet to 400,000 people and provide the work of a German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the construction of the King George tower building on 27 floors in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work was yet to begin and Hochtief closed the sale of 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, it will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC allocated tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its Alpine branch, the FCC has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer tunnel for the motorway in Slovenia worth €64.5 million.
The company obtained a contract a few days after the work was carried out to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for execution is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore gets advertising in Renfe
Renfe has assigned advertising and marketing services over the past two years to Sra. Rushmore for an approximate amount of three million euros a year, the company operating the railway reported.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies that featured in the audition listed by Renfe, of which four advanced to the final, among them TBWA, which was responsible for creating advertising for the past three years.
From now on, it will be Sara. Rushmore to care about designing and producing campaigns.
Fine 63 million for France Télécom for the brakes on the competition
The regulatory authority for competition in France fined 63 million euros lFrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean-based areas.
According to this institution, the operator has limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and fidelity programs with consumers on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has bought more than 560 million euros of fines since 1994 for putting obstacles on its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the office that oversees the competition believes that France Télécom committed a similar offence as in the past and that there was therefore a recurrence.
Application Shop
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store to increase revenues that will not come from voice broadcasts.
From the beginning, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries as Spain.
Playing in the Champions league brought Madrid and Barça from the beginning
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth-grade most profitable club in the competition.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
To win the UEFA Champions League doesn't just bring fame. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
To the extent that the competition distributed €5.362.5 million among the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish ones) that have participated in this event since the opening of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money he received for his participation, and the only one along with AC Milan, who won the main prize three times.
The Catalan current champion and the last winner of the defunct Europe Cup in 1992 is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich's Bayern, two teams, who also charged the most money for participating in the previous Champions League.
Even though she lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to get the most money through the Champions, even though it won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for distributing the money used by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to make $109,000 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA donates $413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have reached the participation received CZK 3.8 million only for their presence, in addition to the additional €550,000 for each match they participate in.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 for each squad). Eight-finalists get three million each; eight quarter-finalists3 million.
Each of the last four gets 4 million.
The champion will earn $9 million, while the second finalist will earn 5.2 million.
In this way, the club earns at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça received $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four places assigned.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday published the details of the purchase of shares, with the help of which it wants to raise the peak place between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offering for the acquisition of (options) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share it would pay at the age of ten and for which interest would apply for this deferral of 1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day deadline for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had merged with the regulator.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to stay on the margins of possible offers to buy and match the court swings of his former leaders, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazars, the election of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit, was announced.
This decision makes it the first woman to have a high function in a food business.
It is a newly created place that will be subject directly to the president of the group.
And it is not exempted from the controversy, as the business continues to be immersed in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos to the Salazar brothers.
In fact, it is not possible to shred the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new transfers of funds
As for Salazar's credit, former members of the Council of Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified at the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authories the option to exclude Patternina in participating in Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday allowed the exclusion of the Inversor Mer to Federico Patternin9. October.
The supervisory authority explained that it permits this operation, since it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and considers that the "sufficient" content explaining the brochure presented after the modifications introduced on 2 December.
CNMV clarified that the offer was aimed at acquiring 55,0000,008 shares of Federico Patterna at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company’s capital, made up of 6,142,786 shares accepted for trading on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
He further explained that 5,5592,778 million shares were immobilised, which will not be able to be transferred in any way until an offer was concluded, specifying that the price was fixed by Federico Patinina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for car valuation
These days, they are rioting and accidents are not only earning car repair shops.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance claim are towed to a service where the expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insured event is the same, and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of the workforce can be a long and complex work.
Calculate manually the cost of repair from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and workforce can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this kind of system.
Service providers and solutions for estimating insurance and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solera is a leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation tools and elaboration of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not at all easy.
According to Eduard Velázquez, Sales Director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of which provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of processing data continues to grow, as more versions, variants and motor solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
This is a very feverish job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic design is carried out, where it is possible to "puncture" individual parts of tourist cars.
When it comes to a model with a massive sale, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for a minor car, it can take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models with information about are Porsches, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
They exceed 99% of the mobile park in circulation.
To carry out the work of documentation and the elaboration of databases, Audatex has eight centers divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The National Seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (normally experts on mechanics) work with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million a year in the development of these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are included and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense stream of information allows businesses to make different uses and the provision of different products.
The most common use is focused on repairs and maintenance, but by country, there are also tools for controlling spare parts or for calculating the sale or residual value of the car.
The only undertaking at its disposal to have a guide to informing about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
Taking into account the products offered by Audatex, it's easy to get the support that professionals in the sector can take advantage of.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard solution for the valuation of claims intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the time for repairs estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is paid according to the application for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, no more than ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the full identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it has been removed from the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass concentrates on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to disable vehicles with an overall insurance claim.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying the tendency, conducting geodemographic analyses or finding deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a particular brand have passed through service due to an accident or how many serious insurance claims have suffered over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for connoisseurs and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices, and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is an Einsa Group company founded in 1971 as a service provider and resolution of damage assessment, crashes or car maintenance
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover volume increased by 20% per year in the last three years and charged 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization began to be the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of her brother is produced in Europe and 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
World invoicing of the Soler Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will make 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group cost $1,000 million on the stock exchange, and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2,4,400 million.
It has been listed in the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insured event.
The operation envisaged the subscription of 59.5 million euros from the 85% of the company's capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of the purchase was to provide more value-envalued services to customers with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, spare parts sales and professional dealers who have to register before the start of operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads, and about 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, the car whose chassis number has been decommissioned cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Cars with historical value may have authorised operation, although they were discarded, after preliminary proceedings.
Service budget in four steps
