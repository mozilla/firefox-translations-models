Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in a store in San Francisco
The twenty-eight-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the staircase of a local shop this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who wants to hurt him, adding, "He finally started to thrive."
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a twenty-eight-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, the medical office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
The victim's Louis Galicia's brother told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a regular chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for the restaurant, Sons & Daughters, said their deaths were "shocked and destroyed."
“We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss him very much," the spokesman said.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and grief belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank was sleeping in the dorms at first, but that he had recently "finished to thrive."
"He found an apartment, he was walking with a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked our food, he made us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to take part in an argument.
It was the brother who took things as they were.
“While everything else in the world is wrong, he was an uncut diamond that lit up every day,” he said.

Czech Railways has invested more than 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested more than CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually declining.
Czech Railways has invested more than CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles in the last six years.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in the reduction of the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
The carrier put a larger share of investments in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money was directed, 40 percent were then invested in the renewal of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, the upgraded older vehicles are included in this indicator as completely new.
If the modernization of vehicles were not expected, the average age of ČD's locomotion vehicles would increase by ten years.
On average, personal wagons are slightly older, the average age of which is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of manufacture was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, classic trains composed of wagons and towing locomotives have been gradually disappearing from the Czech and global railways in recent years and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive decreased from 280 to 223 units, similarly the number of classic wagons from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was mainly disposed of old vehicles equipped with leatherette seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
From the investments that ČD plan to carry out in the vehicle fleet in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic express lines.
The contract envisages the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
Authorities have known about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We are completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial board of the online daily Aktuálně.cz follows the story of a billboard in South Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where there is not only an interesting walk in the treetops, but also the Olympic park.
The highway managers know they're standing there in the dark, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of similar ads across the country.
According to officials, a flask law is to blame, due to which it is not possible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
A complex bureaucratic circle is needed first.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start again.
A quarter of a year ago, the Road and Motorway Directorate admitted: at the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno, an advertising billboard stands on our property by the state road.
But even three months were not enough for the officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
As if no one cared that he was standing next to the road, in a fifty-meter protection zone, where for safety nothing is allowed.
Road administrators say they can't simply cope with the billboard because of the leaky law.
Maybe load it up and take him away.
"We must not just afford this," says Nina Ledvinová, spokesperson for the Road and Motorway Directorate, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel, which must be preceded by the removal of the billboard according to the law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which the online daily Aktuálně.cz began to monitor in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In South Bohemia alone, the editorial board counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to the road or near the road.
The same is true of other countries.
"We have trouble forcing companies to remove the banners," confirms Jiří Klása, the head of the transport department of the České Budějovice Regional Authority, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to Klása, the winding law is to blame for tying officials.
First, he must be intricately addressing the owner of the billboard to give the ad away.
But bosses of companies are often unrivalled or know the trick that Aktuálně.cz has already described in the past when it became more interested in the issue: just move the mobile stand with advertising by a few meters, and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising in the trash.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new device and we have to contact the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
The change could be brought by a new law, which will ban billboards by highways from September next year and limit them even on Class I roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities won't be relieved.
Companies can still earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on the lease of illegal areas and no one can afford them.
For example, a billboard attracting Lipno belongs to the company Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the České Budějovice municipality currently conducts three administrative proceedings with it for black-built billboards.
The company faces a fine of three hundred and thousand in every proceedings.
These are more advertisements that were placed without permission in the protection zone of the 1st class road.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Transport Department of the České Budějovice Municipality.
Advertising that Aktuálně.cz is not yet involved in these cases, but will soon be added to them.
According to RMD spokeswoman Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written requests for removal, and the case will be put on the table of regional and then probably magistrates.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that fails to contact.
She does not take over the post office and canceled the official seat in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It is unclear who is behind it.
In the past, the company's post office went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
However, Fischer, whose Euro Billboard is renting and offering them to advertisers, has rejected any connection in the past.
This spring, when the RMD became interested in advertising at the Lipno initiative, Fischer had the state officials sent a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his guesthouse, where the company is allegedly newly based.
However, even from this address, no one has called the highway administrators to this day.
Futile struggle.
Similar silence or opaque changes in settlements are not uncommon.
We gradually fined one company for two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed the name and ID and there was nothing to deal with.
The executor returned the case, the ads continued, perhaps in other places.
We are quite helpless against such companies and their business practices.
It is like fighting windmills, one of the officials admits, on condition of the preservation of anonymity.
No one is yet addressing the amendment to the law in this regard.
Aktuálně.cz spoke to several MPs who were interested in the problem.
They have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards in the main Czech roads.
The government has denied this.
Billboards are not only a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national, but also regional and municipal politicians.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they themselves need them because of advertising in election campaigns.
I do not give the rather established impression that when something does not work, it is necessary to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, statisticians estimate.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's crop exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
On the other hand, the harvest of rapeseed (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is according to the estimate, which according to the condition as of 15. July published the Czech Statistical Office.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a tenth drop compared to last year.
Last year’s cereal harvest was above average.
This year’s crop exceeds the average for the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy seeds will be higher this year.
Rapeseed growers will harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they received 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decline in cereal production is due to a reduction in the hectare yield by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in sowing area.
Farmers have sown three percent fewer fields this year.
The winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be 3.3 percent less this year.
The farmers sent her in more fields.
However, the decrease will be affected by the lower yield of hectares, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
About one-fifth decrease is expected by statisticians for spring barley, which is most often used for beer production.
The reduction of crops is due to a reduction in crop area by 15.2 percent, but also lower hectare yield.
Winter barley, on the other hand, is produced by 6.3 percent more.
The harvest will also increase.
The rapeseed crop is estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more than last year.
Settlements expanded by 7.3%.
But the hectare yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rapeseed crop will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, while sowning on an area a third more extensive than it was ten years ago.
In the last four years, the fields with poppy seeds have also been increasing.
This year, the farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when the poppy in the Czech Republic was grown on a record 70 000 hectares, however, the fields are half.
Thanks to the expansion of the crop areas, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise by 2.5 percent compared to last year to 27,423 tons.
But the hece yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police officers charged two men for knife attack and machete, the court sent them to custody.
Police have charged two attackers who attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete on Tuesday in central Olomouc.
"While the victim tried to escape, they caused him a staple and cut injury, which required treatment in the hospital and further treatment," police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
Both obvious perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack by police.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to take them into custody and the court granted him on Friday.
Both men face between three and ten years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with a knife and a machete for assaulting a thirty-five-year-old man in the center of Olomouc.
The attackers caused him seed and cut injuries, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which occurred on Tuesday at noon on Freedom Avenue, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
The masse of the skirmish between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked with the help of a knife and a machete of a thirty-five-year-old man.
Although the assaulted man tried to escape, they caused him a sow and cut injury that required treatment at the hospital and further treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
During the skirmish, which attracted a lot of attention in the city center and due to which several police patrols and officers had to intervene on the spot, it was family disputes.
Criminologists have charged a thirty-four-year-old man from Slovakia and a thirty-seven-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to take them into custody and the court granted him on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
The machete was also used in the center of Olomouc during a mass fight by the attackers also five years ago, it happened only a few dozen meters away, before the disco Varna in Riegrova Street.
Police said at the time that a group of roughly ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the business who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most glaring examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážné Square.
It should have been working as a hotel.
But still nothing.
Do we need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what to use existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several apartment buildings, which, despite their location, size and often monumental protection only desolate and are empty.
We have selected real estate in the center using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, opaque relations between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

The Clintons made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to disclose his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, grossed $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were donated to Clinton for charity.
Most of the Clintons' income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
U.S. Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax statements on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, grossed $10.6 million last year, AP reported.
Most of the Clintons' income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign ahead of the election.
The tax report showed that the Clintons paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, as well as a state-state and local income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
But Trump has a similar step, and he has not yet decided to publish his tax return.
There's a possibility that Donald Trump is not paying any taxes at all, Clinton tweeted minutes after her release of her return.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrecy surrounding Trump’s revenue, among other things, to raise doubts about whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims, the AP reported.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with his former First Lady, today released a report on his tax levies over the past decade.
Together with his wife Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity, and paid 25.6 percent of their earnings in taxes last year.
In Nigeria, a polio broke out again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram prevented rigorous vaccination and killed the doctor.
There have been cases of polio in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government declared an emergency vaccination there, as two children infected with the disease here paralyzed.
The vaccines were transported there by helicopters.
Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were active in the affected area, defending the vaccination and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was circulating undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, an extraordinary vaccination of polio children will begin, as two children infected with the disease have been paralyzed there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed in Somalia two years ago.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children and another four million in the surrounding states will be inoculated in Borno state.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly transported polio vaccines to the stricken northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulting unnoticed in the area for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have previously prevented vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where polio children were detected.
The two affected toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly freed from Boko Haram.
Michel Zafran, director of the WHO section responsible for the eradication of polio, told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria will begin as early as next week.
In the state of Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long operated.
The area was only made available to international organizations and the government at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that new polio cases are a big disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to report next year that polio was eradicated in it.
The WHO pointed out that it was possible that although the disease did not appear for two years, it still spread among the children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, half of all polio cases in the world accounted for Nigeria.
While in 1988 the polio was still in 125 countries, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the turbulent stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis has met twenty former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps thanks to the police.
The pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look confidently into the future.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for the fight against him.
Pope Francis has met in Rome with twenty former prostitutes who were freed by police from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the turbulent stories of the fallen women for more than an hour and subsequently urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes visited by Francis were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensification of the fight against him, the pope's spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fate of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican in April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France is hit by jihadist factories.
Without the help of Muslims, it will not be possible.
Muslims themselves are supposed to help France in the fight against radical Islamism.
Moreover, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing major changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer rooms.
And more will follow, the Home Secretary announced.
More than a hundred jihadist factories operate in the country.
“If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee that religion of freedom,” he said.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only the imams educated in the mosques and prayer halls preach in France.
At the same time, it wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, the most from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
For this, preachers who can sow radicalism in France come to mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he added.
The key to ensure that these goals are achieved by the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, is now working in the country.
Even then, the foundation was supposed to contribute to the more transparent flow between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon hit by internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine, a debate about a new institution that will replace the dysfunctional foundation was already inflamed in January 2015.
All this has been hastened by other terrorist attacks in France, which were carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently said that the new foundation will be established in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also supervise the imams.
For now, it is unclear where he will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also various educational centers.
However, a few proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
This would be paid in practice by the sellers of halal food, for providing certification.
Some of this money would then go to the foundation's cash register.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims, who will go to Mekka.
Every year, about 30 000 of them go there for a traditional pilgrimaging to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should operate in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the sermon is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is in the campaign against the radicals.
And more will follow, the interior minister recently announced.
In France, there is no place for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of our country’s principles, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, according to estimates, there are about 2500 mosques and prayer halls.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled about 80 mums and are considering it for several dozens.
But not everyone thinks that the government’s actions can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This does not happen in mosques, young people are radicalized on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Centre for Scientific Research.
The Kelemen track lost in Round 1 of the sprint with the star Baugé.
The Czech track cyclist must fight for advancement to the eight-finals in repairs.
Track cyclist Pavel Kelemen lost a duel with French great Grzegorym Baugé, defending silver medalist in the first round in the 1st round, after advancing from the sprint qualifiers among the top eighteen, defeated the silver medalist in London.
He must fight for the eight-finals in repairs.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track, 27 riders stood up and the best Czech tracker of the present time gained the 14th best time.
He managed a two-hundred with a fleeting start in 9.69 seconds.
In the main knockout stage, he was the fifth Baugé, who already has a bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Kelemen in the end was pushing the experienced Frenchman, who watched the procedure.
The great performance flashed the gold defender Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old Briton finished third fastest in history and won the qualifiers in the Olympic record of 9.551.
As expected, he also easily dealt with the last advancing, which was the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet in the line-up with Bradley Wiggins was also successful, which in the 4 km pursuit race set a new world record of 3:50.570 and advanced to the final.
The maximum (351,659), which had belonged to the British for four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the field
Representatives of the junior doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Council of Young Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must seek the entire Council to support further industry actions in early September.
The JDC says the ministers have not been able to resolve the issues regarding the treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject the contract agreed with BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "quietly" on issues, a good word to reject the contract.
She said: "In this light, the authority of the executive of the JDC voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and to request new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Executive Board formally asked for a special meeting of the BMA board to approve the running programme of escalated industry events at the beginning of September.
The dispute led young doctors to declare six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the junior doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which BMA recommended.
At meetings before the vote in front of 54 000 young doctors and medical students, he told BMA members that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said the treaty would be a burden on the medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of “incompatible”?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to the eight-month long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterparty in the sumptuous hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more to this reconciliation.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin was not smiling, and he was barely radiating warmth, even according to his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his “expensive friend” to Mr Putin – five times, as one of the reports reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their level before the crisis, but would be even better.
The next day, some of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm betrayed the exact opposite.
But the lingering cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was furious at the time.
Putin handed out wounds around him and accused Ankara of slamping a knife in the back.
The scandal was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuild real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
For months, state-controlled media has been campaigning a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it looked as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
More serious was accusations from top state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came an official message that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the ceasefire's declaration are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during a failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken it.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - mainly the abolition of charter flights, which annually transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey.
This number has fallen by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will certainly relax here when the flights are restored.
They make money from Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the report in the newspapers Vedomosti said.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as what he sees as a poor response to the coup attempt.
In addition, long-lasting hostile streak of talks on joining the EU and Putin's accession - who is eager to take advantage of the cooling and tear Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after attempting a coup.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seafront palace allowed Russia and Turkey to show what one of the analysts described to me as the “incompatible alliance”: how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West are joining forces.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
You could say that after nearly three hours of introductory talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned this issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answers to a question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two states could find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of utter catastrophe, when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian warplane - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least speak together again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside of Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand is to be suppressed into the role of the back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
It eased when it nearly disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategists used "RBS" in order to protect other brands of consumer finance.
It was worth millions of pounds to sponsor international sport, from the Rugby Championship Six Nations to Winbledo champion Andy Marraye.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more stand out for the national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will come more to the forefront - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our travels to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered us with questions from Ross McEwan.
“The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and brand that our employees are working for because we are now becoming a brand bank of brands.”
Because the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our staff will work under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations championship, preparing a profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
“Have it been a good time for us to move on to a brand bank, because the basic question (which we ask ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?”
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we said we would become a great customer bank and introduce those brands.
But along with the way we focused on the needs of customers, and not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes going on.
We can recall these brands, I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the Predilection lead to the finish of the 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory in Newmarket brought him 3000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in Britain on Friday in New Market.
He reached this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track - on the Pridilect horse, which is coached by John Gosden.
The forty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who achieved such a result in straight races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple-time champion of Dettori, who had previously won a horse on a horse, said: "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is also here
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because it was here that I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on earth with 20 000 people.
I am relieved and I am very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when Predilek brings in after victory
Two jockeys of this milestone have achieved this hurdle race - jockey champion Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has led more than 4,300 winners to the finish line during his career breaking records.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 winners in his career
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from the other riders in the weigh-in.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn’t only ride on weekends and big races, he would have had 6 000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie drove the winners in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
It has a lively character, which is good for the British racing sport. But more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori Celebrates His Success with His Famous Celebral Jump
From the fleeting finishes to the fleeting jumps - Frankie Dettori was the delivery of the British planar races for two decades.
It was like a rollercoaster ride.
A plethora of the winners of the big races, including his well-known "great-belt seven" in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off due to drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a 6-month ban, but showed incredible inner strength and returned to all doubters in its best shape.
And maybe this isn't the last time - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue racing at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Putin Releases Chief of Sermis Forces Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest collaborators for many years.
Sixty-three-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin "leaked Ivanov from his service of the head of the Russian presidential office," but the reason was not given.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno was previously a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn, in 1972, graduated at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) it is reported that he later worked as head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he was appointed to Putin, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of administration is to support your activities of the head of state within the meaning of draft laws and control to what extent your instructions are followed.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to release him from the post and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Will he convince smiles?
This move completely mystisfied Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for a long time and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcasted by state television, the two men said he was leaving the post of head of the presidential office at their own request.
But smiles in the cameras have convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this a consequence of a power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
But the official assertion that a man once thought of as a possible president longed to suddenly pursue Russia's environmental policy has been met with great disbelief.
Notes to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to give me this very demanding post, you could even say a problematic post, for four years.
I've been head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, he worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 90's, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest associates.
At one time, there was even speculation that Ivanov could become Putin’s successor at the head of state after his second term, as the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
This post was taken over by another close collaborator of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, star of the crime idea series, was released after he hit the director
Gibson was involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his firing was announced.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS, the details of how Gibson's character disappears from the series, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, a little later.
The 40-year-old actor, best known for his lead role in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has appeared in the series since the first season of 2005.
"I love the thoughts of a criminal, and over the last twelve years I have put my heart and soul into them," Gibson said in a statement, which he issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end. But that won't be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans of which this show could ever hope for.
The series is expected to return to the 12th season on September 28.
Fish mysteriously landed in the town of Banff
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be the sand eel left there by the water whirlwind.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a short film of his find on the Periscope channel thinking that someone might help him clarify how about the 5cm fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern plateau and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
This is the first of the four caps between the "both fans of the platforms", which are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30 000 tons.
It has 10 000 tons of iron and 20 000 tons of concrete and 46 pendant ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic secretary Keith Brown visited the construction today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building the Queensfera Crossing.
On this project, we all see how construction engineers, in a deed of an impressive scale, have used more than 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel to design this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the cap between the viaduct and the platform of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
In its place, there is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, the concrete for the last parts of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be picked up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first closure in the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of civil engineering.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and very delicate operation at the same time.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6 000 tons and it was necessary to drag it with an ascent of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team worked with were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Saving at Moelfre Bay: Three Men Are 'Happy They're Alive'
Three men are "happy they're alive" after they were washed away by water from their fishing boat at Anglesey's.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station reported an alarm on Friday at 13:20 a.m. British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued unsteemed.
"We saw their boat circling their vicinity and we thought the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones, a lifeboat helmsman.
"Thankfully, the strong winds away him before we left him before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted without a life jacket as he clings to a buoy.
All were boarded the coastal lifeboat and transported back to the station of the lifeboats
Jones said: "These men dropped into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had a rope for an emergency shutdown, but somehow it disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when it was overturned.
Someone was holding a protective hand over those boys.
The judge refuses to deal with the case over Tluchoř's wife.
Petr Tluchor is one of three deputies who, according to the indictment, should have received a political traffic from Prime Minister Nečas and his then head of the cabinet, Jana Nagyová, a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Šnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř made it possible for their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned companies.
That is why they also faced suspicions of a bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they were compensated for a total of almost CZK 2 million.
The compatrioture is now appearing as a witness in the case after the Supreme Court's intervention.
His wife works in a courthouse on the Fruit Market and resolves civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious (addressing criminal matters) and prevent possible objections.
The case will probably be in charge of another Prague judicial district.
The king has already acquitted Jana Nečasová twice, formerly Nagyová.
It was allegedly abuse of military intelligence to monitor Prime Minister Nečas's first wife Radka.
In this case, Tluchoř did not figure.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in this way for the court to be excluded if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to be judged, he said to the diary.
"It seems crazy," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged in the case of political traffic.
According to his attorney, Petr Toman, however, any objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 heard 13. June indictment of former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas Jana Nagyová (now Nečasová) and other defendants in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nečasová and her husband come to court.
Tluchorova was supposed to deal with statements about Peroutka.
For example, the ex-deputy’s wife was supposed to judge the remarks of President Miloš Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is dead!
The girl was apparently killed in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two same-old girlfriends from London Gatwick Airport last February.
The Home Office did not comment on the report on her death.
According to police, the young Londoners who fled from home were secretly transported to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadida Sultana, according to the media, headed for their other former classmates from London's Bethnal Green Academy.
The case sparked a huge wave of attention last year, as well as tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria so far, about 50 of them young women and girls.
A number of them have joined the radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for a hundred-thousand-dollar salary.
A great paid job for which you don't even need college.
This is what the IT guy looks like at first glance.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only for Czech conditions extremely high salary (in Prague you earn up to 180 000 CZK), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to a huge shortage of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, almost 20 000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to statistics of Grafton recruitment agency, the most wanted are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, candidates do not compete for a job position, but job positions for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a must for IT people.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate’s intelligence and educability, but it often doesn’t have much to do with knowledge of development.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which once graduated college will not replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most earned in Prague.
The health wages everywhere are high above the national average.
They will come to the most money in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hit parade.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
Technical directors will reach the highest earnings.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but even there it does not fall below 80 000 CZK.
IT project managers are also in demand.
At the start they can earn 60 000 - 100 000 CZK.
The fight is also for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, it does not apply to IT guys.
If companies drag and overpay an expert from another company, they like to reach for a graduate.
They can raise it in their own way.
They can't do without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but it is necessary for IT professionals at least decent English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are looking for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker speaks multiple foreign languages, it is interesting for his employer, because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds director Kubačka.
Joóó in Google, there is paradise.
Czech workers can only quietly envy employees at Google.
Of course there is flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various part-time jobs, not only for mothers.
"The company provides the new dads with four weeks of extra vacation after the birth of the baby," says Martina Jonek, a Google spokeswoman.
Pampering also includes health care for employees and families, catering, transport, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn is green and it does not matter what you want to learn.
But the benefits do not end there.
Such a full free refrigerator is also definitely not to be discarded.
A healthy lunch (in some localities as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-ticups in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the speaker reveals.
And in order not to throw anything away, what is not eaten, he puts in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these unbelievable advantages by Czech standards?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“For Google, it’s not important that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, progress or development, ideas, and innovative solutions,” he said.
The UN has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Human Rights Commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "monsters serious concerns about Bulgaria failing to comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He said: “it is particularly unsettling to witness how important and influential public figures are publicly expressing support for criminal armed fighters that brazenly hold hunts for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey.”
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who switch to Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested in an irregular manner," Zeid said.
Worse, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has arrested 14 000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21 000.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness, which pays off
It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the last decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people from the sofas and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens originally shrunk to TV, later on video games and most recently on smartphones.
It's great to keep track that technology and outdoor activities are not excluded.
I’m talking, of course, about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 90’s (later drawn series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game in the beginning of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
The input in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of the servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has in a few days.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out looking for Pokémon to track with GPS, and when they find them, they can "photograph" them (via screenshot on the phone) or "catch" them.
Mania has engulfed the generation that played the game at a younger age, lifting it from the seats and driving it out to look for Pokémon.
In the USA, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the “average” person does every day.
Apple's Cardiogram, which tracks 35 000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of people who exercised every day jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company does not have information about who is playing Pokémon Go - it sees only gross data on the levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns striving for people to “find 30,” “getting up off the couch” and “being active every day” fell on barren ground, as most public health messages are boring and destined for people who don’t look good.
However, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in controlling weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot all give here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine. And fun.
Some people even make new friends when they chase the Pokémon.
As is the case, of course, there are also those boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk in the door.
And what, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their time, smartphone apps, such as Fitbit, were able to track our activity, but they didn’t give us any reason to do something like this game.
The novelty is over and the interest in it begins to fall off at some point.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in multi-fight women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the skipping.
Effortless on the beam.
In the simple, they all were speechless.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally, the Olympic champion.
The nineteen-year-old American gymnast went straight to the multi-fighter title on Thursday and surpassed the others on the full line under the Olympic spotlight.
The overall result of 62.198 clearly confirmed her lead over the silver medalist and member of the "final five" team Ala Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Alijati Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a performance on a beam in the final of the individual in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win multi-strike, and fifth overall, confirming her reputation as her best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final rating was on the board and her long journey to this point ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks it in the same league of unique athletes of their time as Michael Phelps, who have given their sport a new dimension:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold. Her stunning line-ups are a mix of ambition and precision, and Olympic 1984 champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the female racers, but between herself and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals, would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), on the left, and Aly Raisman are hugging after winning the gold and silver medals in the final of female multi-strike at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
She won her first Tuesday when she was an exclamation point in a celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that during her long journey to the top, she never looked forward, which is not entirely true.
Part of her line-up in the simple - the one that contains the typical triple-nacking double-turned double-turned one - is set in Latin music that would just fit home, into the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's no coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on the way to the gym, where Boorman trained and where she gained strength.
The multi-fight competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 - this is the sequence of victory that can continue for as long as Biles will want.
Even though Mustafin took the lead short thanks to two spins, it was just an illusion.
The shed and the shed - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back to the lead with 15.433 points behind the beam - and finished with 15.933 points in the simple.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering red, white and blue shadows appeared tears as Biles came true when the wish she had once written in her diary as a child had come true.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a retribution for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but then she was a bronze because of the sum of the top three sets.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "grandma", was a lot ahead.
After her simple ones, she sent the crowd of air kisses, overcame by a return that sometimes seemed insecure.
For Biles, this nineteen-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it has become a complete hit, has a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women and a girl died at the age of 12 during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while they were sitting in the car, talking and listening to the music.
Authorities have reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, were shot dead 12. June in a car parked in the driveway.
The report said the armed man was standing on the passenger side and fired eight shots from a handgun. He then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the tropic is not worth the three-time murder because the attacker did not take his wallets, nor the amount of $2,900, which was carried by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sgt. Jonathan Howard said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks occurred in four months in which seven people were killed and two others were injured.
“This is going on in a residential area in front of houses,” Howard said earlier this month for CBS’ KPHO.
Police believe the suspect was using several cars, including brown Nissan from the late 90's, a black BMW from the late 90's and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty van of six months before the triple murder. Police believe that the originator was this serial killer.
Investigators found the shell casings and assembled a bullet from the remnants of bullets in the seat and from under the bonnet of the engine.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: "Its condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike her peers, she suffers from microcephaly, which is a consequence of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I was the first to think I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent have learned that Edmund may never have known them and that she might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested he be placed in an institution.
“My first reaction was that I thought people weren’t doing this anymore,” Picciut explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Until the age of three, he could not sit or crawl. And he still doesn't talk.
Some milestones are already slowly being fulfilled.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is showing off the sign language with which Edmund says “please sing me.”
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says that Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetics, as is the case with Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may differ significantly.
It's too early to be able to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciut recalls the emotional toll that the uncertain future is taking.
I keep asking, “What’s next?”
What's next?
And she's still not sure about it.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis is, because I don't expect anyone to tell me at all.
But Picciut has an encouraging message for mothers of all children suffering from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods required rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare an emergency on Friday. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi will spill from its shores and threaten extensive flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and assistance is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's office for national security and readiness for crisis situations, said they were receiving applications for vehicles for driving in the water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the trinogram of Tangipahoa asked for ten thousand sandbags.
Flood patrols will remain to work in most southern Louisiana by Saturday.
The weather service said in a statement that about 8 to 13 centimeters may rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama, a flood patrol was on standby on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
According to the forecast, the Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are scheduled to culminate over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said the two said could flood a number of homes in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He said the danger was flooding downstream in the Ascension district, when these flooded flows will be poured slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, slightly south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest levels recorded on Friday at 9 a.m. local time.
Rescuers are still picking up people from torrential waters in Amie and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step son, were previously among those rescued at Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other half-son, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it all the way to my waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all members of his family were disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said crisis workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of heavy rains, the flooding is "quickly spreading" and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rainfall had fallen from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid trips required rescue residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the cancellation of classes in five school districts.
A branch of the WWL station CBS reported that 200 homes were flooded according to the eldish from Tangipahoo.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, which are now flooded by both of them.
The mayor of the municipality, Robby Miller, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals trapped by the high water.
In the village of Amite and in the city of Hammond, shelters were established for those who were evacuated.
"They'll be able to come home when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the Tangipahoa district in the city of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and locals were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had the last big floods here in March," said Lacy Landrum, the town's administrator.
Looks like these floods will be similar.
Rupert Lacy, manager for crisis situations in Harrison, Mississippi, said persistent rain continues on the Gulf coast.
He said a couple of houses were announced on Thursday, but on Friday none of them appeared in the report.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and she's still there."
Mahai Brown (6) - 'boy shot like a solve, survived firing in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia. This week marks the second shooting at a child aged 6 in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahai Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weaknesses, legs, arms and abdomen, but were conscious when transported to the hospital.
"He got a lot, his little body was shot through like a solution," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition in hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was supposed to enter the first grade of elementary school.
Mahe Brown is among the four people who have been shot in the Germantown section.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more victims are in stable condition.
According to the station's report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a twenty-nine-year-old man in a critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be a gunman.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was likely to be a shootout between several armed men.
Cartridges were found at the scene from offensive-type weapons belonging to various offensive weapons.
It was certainly a continuing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
So it seems that there were several armed fighting persons who were actively involved," Philistralian police captain Anthony Ginalidi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been detained and police are reportedly examining video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time the girl, was shot in the arm with a stray shot on Tuesday in front of a house next door to West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women's team of gymnasts for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colorful girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black women and Latino at the top of this sport.
Gymnist number one in the past four years has been an African-American woman.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second place last year.
It means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who showed off unexpected but master gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's individual-bomph.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing a sports peak, but in gymnastics lessons in the ground it doesn't look like it.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same journey as the Aly and Madison to the Olympic team.
They are the “final five” because the team of gymnasts for the next Olympics will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mostly in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, trips, jertches, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families). And that's far from all.
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training sessions, and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training, which are more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls who inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or at low cost in Harlem for more than 15 000 young people within the city (mainly black and Hispanic descent) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (y my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, achievements at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to us who will want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Attendance in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing the "girl strength" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's motion, young doctors are ready to enter further strikes
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be an end to disagreements over the changes. But 58 percent of the 37 000 junior doctors who took part in the election rejected the treaty.
Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract in July, saying the NHS was in the “many country” and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend working procedures to improve care in the unsocial hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairwoman of the BMA for young doctors, said in a statement last night: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labor crisis and thus fair treatment of all doctors."
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with the unwillingness to engage the dr and often with deafening silence from the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this possibility is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement, and resolve the concerns of junior doctors.”
If this does not happen, then the young doctors are ready to take the next steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100 000 visits were postponed, as nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers hoped that after concluding the revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be no disagreements on the changes.
BMA wants higher payments for work over the weekend for 54 000 junior doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS employers, urged young doctors not to take any strike.
Mortimer said: “The industry action will achieve little or nothing at all, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services, and there will be growing concern, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families.”
In the past two months, we have negotiated with the advice of young doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and others we have responded positively to them with concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as busy, flexibility in training, further training training, further training training sessions, other training sessions, study leave and gender pay - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health take the agreements reached with BMAs in November, February and May.
The drug for sixty crowns per day can reduce the danger of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs around sixty crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend administering it to more patients for an extended period of time.
The drug against blood clotting Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a seizure occurring again in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after having a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to humans for four years to further reduce the dangers of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be administered to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140 000 people suffer from a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer from another attack or heart attack.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is torn off, a blood clot may develop, blockage of blood to the heart and the development of a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, block the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca and is sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces the risk of clots becoming less likely.
In the proposal for the NICE directive, which was published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg along with aspirin, twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Successly, despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer from another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.
Ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, is shown to be effective at reducing the dangers of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand treatment options that are available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the danger of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, the proposal for treatment above this time is not recommended.
With computer culture, fraud has flourished in Muslim areas
The mayor of the city of Hamlash City Luthfur, Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, which was linked to government news
The culture of political correctness has led to an overlap of spreading fraud in Muslim communities, a government report said today.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticizes the police, election inspectors and town halls for ignoring voter abuse for "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
An earlier secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption intervention, said that the intimidation of voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons and protect the barked voters from the polling stations.
He recommended that voters take their identity documents with them and be able to prove who they are during the election.
At present, voters just need to state their name and address.
In the report, it is also proposed to apply indelible ink to the fingers of people when casting a vote in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It asks that the press be given greater access to the meeting documents and to the decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from a wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor of the city, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his post following allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically affected" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said he had “led his campaign to be a religious duty of the Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were challenged or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and someone else is issued.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the postal vote - which is said to have been exerted by senior members of the Muslim community during it exerted pressure on people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, pictured, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
His report states: "Waslific has been presented that the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, primarily in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh."
“Abombled there have been fears that... state institutions have shaken eyes to such behavior because of “politically correct” hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.
Sir Eric has made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including for political activists to manipulate postal votes and prevent “voting.”
The report, now rated by Theresa May, is also asking for more thorough checks in registrations to prevent the use of election lists for immigration fraud and levy fraud.
Consider the possibility of requesting voters to submit an identity document before the vote.
Using indelible ink on people's fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Carrying out systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting limit for a period of three years.
Ban political agitators and activists from manipulating the submitted postal votes and electoral envelopes.
Giving the police permission to create cordons around the polling stations.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute people exerting illegal coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibiting taking photos at polling stations.
Require only Englishmen (except Wales) to work at polling stations.
Strengthen the training and ensure that workers follow the rule that voters go to the electoral booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says he is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Election Trial Court has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty in terms of reasonable doubts - in the power of evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the fruitless "checking boxes" in the departments for registering voters at the town hall.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court decision in the Tower Hamlets case by awakening.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Infatuated by the cycling doppelganger of Duchess Kate and other doppelgangers of well-known Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games went crazy this week to French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the twenty-four-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete this year seeking gold, who can boast of her own dove from the ranks of well-known personalities - at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the well-known personalities currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL women's column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As hunted animals: A member of the American archery team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to the Kate doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
The American archery team racer Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after his images emerged in which he is strikingly similar to a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he had heard of his resemblance to Leo since he was a child.
"He doesn't see any great resemblance himself, except his beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking form between British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafin with her big, distinctive eyes was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series Gell, Matthew Morrison, for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan with the "Athletic version" of the actor from the film The Beginning (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova prides herself not only on the same dark skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the USA team, fans say he looks like a “athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitte.”
Profitable women: The star of football Hope So (left) and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape to face and eyes
Not just one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarities
On the waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind a similar appearance of couples
Recently, a Twitter user on the site expressed her satisfaction that “The rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
Football star Hope Solo and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a really unbelievably similar shape to face and eye.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of actress Laura Linney, or gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, who boasts a beautifully wide smile that seems to follow Gabrielle Union's smile, the star of Bravo, girls!
CBC Olympics columnist apologises for saying about Chinese swimmer that she 'shouted'
Viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympics at the CBC station were outraged by an analysis of the performance of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place of the women's 4x200 m relay race in free style
The Canadian station CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a fourteen-year-old Chinese swimmer "dragged like a stink" during the race and "stuck it out."
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was turned off when he began chuding his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200-meter relay finale.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring a "revival" to the CBC commentary team, said, "The little fourteen-year-old from China gave up, you foggy."
Too much excitement, she was wandering like a stink, she exploded.
Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race at a time of 1:57.79 - 1.6 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadians to drag China to beat China.
Viewers in Canada quickly reunited online and were horrified by the tone and the language that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “The CBC announcer said that a fourteen-year-old swimmer “shouted” from China??????????????”
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's relay race in the 4x200 freestyle race was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you foggy."
Byron MacDonald's critic came from all sides on Twitter and many have asked for his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and it sounds like we'd be a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment, saying, "We're sorry for commenting on the performance of a swimmer who leaked to the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC eventually apologises more than 90 times to people who tweeted in reply to comment
Co-commentator Scott Russell had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and put their agrad in a response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald commentator's notes
The station also quickly apologized and made a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, she should not have gotten into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the broadcast and those who follow us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by saying he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize now for commenting on last night after the women's relay," he said in a broadcast from the Olympics on CBC.
“I was referring to the performance of a swimmer and not the person of a swimmer as such.”
"I don't have to say that I didn't intend to be disrespectful and I'm very sorry."
Customers at Primark scandalised by a woman who shamelessly tried her underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman undressed to try panties on the sales floor in the middle of Primark, the shoppers were not sure which direction to look.
To make matters worse, she tried how the size fits her, took off her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued viewing and eventually tried four pairs of panties at the shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
Primark store at the Bouvelie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried her panties before returning them to the shelf
The mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman, after trying her underwear, “she put on again and left the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own tights and panties, and put them on.
"Not even trying to find a discreet place - she was just standing there, cheeky like a monkey."
"Everyone just stared as she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like it because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, dressed again and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was looking at - not even that she'd think of the guy who'd buy the knickers she'd tried."
Miss Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and no one cleaned them. That's ugly.'
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "When she left, I picked up the things she'd obviously tried to take them off the sale - the only right thing to do."
“I would be terrified of the idea of getting new panties home and finding that another woman was wearing them, stripping them off and that they weren’t washed.”
A Primark spokesperson for the store said: "Primark knows about the incident that occurred in our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9."
All products concerned have been withdrawed from sale.
How to defend against a gun attack using Krav Maga
The outside world is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, Grand Master of the Couvy Maga Federation based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the superiority over the rapist, whether it comes close to you from the front or from behind.
If he approaches you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn to see your attacker and "have a free shot path."
You then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before hitting it in the face with your elbow.
Then the knee is followed by the groin, and while the attacker wriths in pain, twist the weapon from his hand, hit the main in the face and begin to recede, while holding the gun at him.
If an armed man coming to you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body off the firing line, grab the gun and wriggle it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, put the strength in the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then wriggle the weapon from his grip and begin to recede, still at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video where you can see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way to get out of the robbery - if you are not a Grand Master of Krav Maga - is to spend all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest spots in Europe to travel guide
The British traveler decided to put up a difficult test of his immune system and the gag reflex - by licking the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and travelogue author Ian Wright, 51, originally from Suffolk, in evidence of the strength of his immune system, limped his tongue out a euro banknote, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a sailing button on the toilet on a train and a Russian public phone.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
However, the experiment, based on the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on the train, which was used by thousands of other people, may seem utterly repulsive, however, there are actually many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health specialists about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked left anything worse in his mouth than an aftertaste.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the durability of his intestines on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he safely tested his immune system - from public railings at train stations to flushing
In the film, who filmed about it, he says: “I haven’t cared much about my health since I was a kid, and I put everything in my mouth, from dirt to eating worms and muddy water.”
He certainly confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swap, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while the newly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy maker Valio have made a thundershold film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the movie, he said, “This is almost the most disgusting thing I’ve ever felt in the bathroom.”
Nothing dirtier than this exists!
I'm not going to licking anything because it's disgusting here.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help people strengthen the intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for Refreshments, Juices and New Categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow self-interest and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in gut health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of talking only about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon, and through this document, we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “ Let’s put it this way, Ian would have lost my respect if he licked something I wanted him to do – like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
To lick some things was naturally easier for Ian, others were pretty hard.
I'm glad we filmed some of the dirty things."
In 2015, Valio conducted a survey that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria mainly with stomach and intestine health, and 58 percent of respondents said they use products containing added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Family of Socially Needed to Destroy the Municipal Building in Saltash in Cornwall Before Eviction
The socially ill family left damage to their municipality at a £50 000 after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forcibly eviction from the house, the housing association officials were shocked when they discovered that the property was in disrepair.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, garbage was lying everywhere on the floor, and the walls were scribling.
The family has already moved out and is thought to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about whether the house would go rescue.
She said: "For the people here it was a nightmare, and I don't think people should live like this.
It is necessary to consider a number of circumstances, because this property will probably come to the attention of the "not so nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who stayed in the house at times, and police said that the terror of the family was involved in were street fights using baseball bats, intimidating surrounding residents, drug use, drug use, and loud shouting, quarrels and swearing.
Skeldons (47), whose name was listed on the lease agreement, was sentenced to antisocial behaviour in June.
In several rooms in the house that may be demolished, stinking garbage were found.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, there was a plucked floor covering
Neighbors say they saw them on the street fighting, and regularly people called the police here
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner for a million this week after they were given an additional 11-week period to move out voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved greeted the eviction, saying their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We've lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here can't be counted at all.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because there was an unbelievable silence - we're not used to that!
It'll be nice here when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, chairman of Cornwall Housing, said the family failed to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Trash and old toys were lying around in an overgrown part of the municipal house
He adds: "It is a shame that the tenant has failed to accept responsibility for her own behavior and for the behavior of her family. Eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to be frightened by her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the local community who bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring a little comfort to the neighbors and at the same time will bring with it the message that we will not tolerate unsociable behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three tenants' tenants who lived in the house at different times were around 20 years old.
Polluted mattress that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after eviction
Workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that have been dumped around the house
In 2014, she officers raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, scales, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty for possession of the B-class drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the foundations of her son's house, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth after eviction.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their lease agreements
Angela Crow of Denova and Cornwall police said the eviction was sending a clear message to other tenants who will continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and to those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
The police of Den and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-social behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low overflight of a military jet plane over the beach
Tourists who savored the rays of sunshine in Aveiro, Portugal, were terrified to death
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion Aircraft Flew Over Unbelievably Low
The military air force said it was a training flight, and insisted there was no threat to security
At the moment when the low-flying jet descended above the crowded beach, the frightened tourists were engulfed by panic.
In dramatic footage, a military plane can be seen reaching the distance of almost to the touch of sunning people on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after they were disturbed by the noise of the engines of the jet aircraft, without seeing what emerged from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted video footage of a dramatic overflow on social media, said: "The plane flew over twice really low and at one point it seemed to collapse."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I surfed and I really thought the plane would fall on my head."
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a plane flying low appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to bear himself low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft reportedly flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that the safety of people has not been compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify a fishing boat as part of the training.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the regulations.
Half of the funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (ČOI) found out during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, the funeral services most often do not inform the survivors of their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The CTIA imposed 41 fines totalling CZK 73,000 for this.
This was reported today by its spokesman Jiří Fröhlich.
Inspectors found misconduct at 47 of 95 inspections.
In addition to non-information about prices and missing certificates, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified gauge.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This was about urn wrappers, candle covers and vases that were not properly labeled with mandatory information.
"Given that there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the inspection will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined IS killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
A lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the family had learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that it was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a group's stronghold in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee from a war-torn country and returning to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others, that these are real dangers associated with the way to the war zone - is that it will discour witness people from making a decision," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the eastern part of London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then on a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she married an IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she was widowed.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The Democratic leader, Harry Reid, says he is confident that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is nominating Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of his election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person to replace the deceased Supreme Court judge will be elected by the future president.
Reid said during a conference call on Thursday that he believed Clinton would pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."
Reid's spokeswoman later said he had not directly discussed with Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and that he had only speculated.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to “swing a boat” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the president of the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland's appointments are "soners" and "coach" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit in office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for “women even for men”
Treats magazine works closely with photographer David Bellemer to release a calendar for 2017, inspired by the Pirelli calendar from the 1970s.
But instead of the revealed celebrities, the NU Muses is trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nudity magazine is different from an old-school playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
He clearly believes that the calendar, too.
“We need to return to depicting timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by photos of the female body,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is vinyl going: who really buys gramophone records?
Vinyl is loved by lone men of middle age.
Before you decide to overwhelm the comments section with pepper notes under the pseudonym All-LoneMenWhitesEddomEan, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of gramophone records is connected not with the boom of millennials who want to enjoy the originality of the ownership of a physical object, but with the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not really about the accumulation of an enthusiastic fan – the whole thing has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to enjoy their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are loved by themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a TV report, the camera would follow me as I go to the busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gemic. Then I'd pull out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's see it."
Let's take a look at it.
While his charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent vendors are slowly fading from the heart of Soho, hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, clothing and office supplies - several fantastic specialized workshop shops with turntables have remained.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I will face close to the different men in these stores and try to see what their age and emotional state is.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and looking at shops to fill in hours.
I ask him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3 or 4 thousand recordings.
All the recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture at the top (he sent me the photo by e-mail, I didn't follow him all the time to go).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records that he couldn’t afford when they were originally coming out, and he’s buying what he sold in his youth and didn’t even have a vindra.
“A lot of what I buy is from the late 60’s and from the early 70’s. These are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12. I was too young then and couldn’t get them,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves. He adds: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers she encounter fits into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old gramophone records back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their gramophone records back,” he says.
This could explain the boom of gramophone record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of gramophone records?
It won’t take you more than a few seconds to find out in a shop like Phonica that in music stores you will find a pleasant community of people with a similar mindset.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly offended by a contactless payment system.
Some fans of gramophone records may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and opt for the familiar environment of the cover of turntable plates, things that trigger memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling the gap or owning something material can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, for me it's so, and I think a lot of people are in a lot of people too.
It's an easy way to fill the place in your head.
“We are all like their social workers!” says a co-worker from a meeting of gramophone records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a gramophone that they never use, while 7% of those who buy gramophone records do not have a gramophone.
At this point in the report, he was probably worried about walking through the pile of compilations of bossa nova.
The "trophy" aspect and revival of interest is something Jonny (42), who works at Sounds of the Universe (three men).
“Someone recently came and said, ‘I don’t have a gramophone yet, but I want to buy Radiohead on the album so we can put it on the shelf.’” he says.
The percentage of such is not large, but it happens.
It’s more about the product page than music.
People come to us who say, “I don’t have a drama.”
These are younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are seventy couples, tourists who take photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the stores before - the loudspeakers, instead of taarse jazz, the latest Wild Beasts pop full of synthesizers and sex is good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly alone, but you can hardly predict intrusic mental trauma when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elorora (27) walks for a few minutes in Fop and inspects various gramophone records at a discount.
She's one of those who's looking at the windows rather than spending feverishly.
According to her, she doesn't earn much, so it's out of the question that she's going to collect gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something. But gramophone records have their charm...," he sighs longingly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that has reportedly inspired a new generation of gramophone record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very biased girls in tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls who are just clustering around Polaroid cameras. Then the father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by the gramophone boards of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any mediocre collection of turntables.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a purely "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for others, there is not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where more time and money is more likely than in other areas, is also where the most spent on the most luxurious goods, as vinyl is certainly.
But while, according to my findings, the results of YouGov seem accurate - that is, at least in the records stores, they do not take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in reality, in the records stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or in offices.
He certainly doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around the records shops on Berwick Street, scrolling through the recordings and avoiding looking at a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the back of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrator - video report
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years of age and measures five meters
Court in France refuses to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected the orders of authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 makeshift shops where people sell goods inside the camp, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, in makeshift restaurants they sell tea for 50 cents or basic dishes for several euros.
The Prefect Office in Calais argued that places need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations said in court that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals, which offers state-supported associations and other groups, do not provide an addition to food for growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from running 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's objections were "completely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much greater role than just serving food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said the premises provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was a cafe in the camp, the Jungle Book Kids, which is run by a non-profit organization and which offers 200 meals, English and French lessons every day, and asylum counseling for hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp.
The petition to protect the “children’s” café was signed by more than 170 000 people.
The Guardian received a letter saying that closing the café "was a disaster for these children, some of them are only 8 years old."
Charity organizations Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer rose to more than 9 000 - the highest number so far in the whole time.
He thought he was dead.
Ulč is resurprising himself and volleyball Ústí.
"Since March I could have been practicing normally," he reported at the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What were you?
I had a double-sided pulmonary embolism, then because of it, heart problems.
Because when I was at a university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So he caused trouble for a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know it.
It hurt me, no one found anything.
Then the clot got up.
The vein is damaged in the calf, it will hurt all the time, especially when the weather is working or changing.
But nothing that limits me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
He had.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevěnice I did not know that I had an embolism, and I could not move there at all.
I threw up my blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was still completely finished for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Wooden Houses, my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going to go up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to watch myself more when I fly somewhere.
But you can do everything about it.
Only when I wanted to return to Příbram immediately last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing my own home alone to be able to play again.
I knock it, physically I'm better off than before.
What do you expect from Usti?
I'm looking forward to it, the bunch looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers to come.
I hope we sit down humanely so that it fits together.
Will You Pick up Usti?
It had a reputation as a bay, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now it finished second.
There is a new team in Ústí, only a few players remain.
It was the last in the extraleague, so there is a lot of room to improve.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first rounds who will be a brut, we won't.
Is the coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced and has experienced a lot, he'll think better than the last place.
But my arrival had nothing to do with it, I made a deal sooner.
There were other coaches in the game, I am a great friend with one and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came, and I'm glad.
He has a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for decades, he's a former good player.
He'll push us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to be happy to be happy and I like to get the opportunity in a not-so-hot team.
I was in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a foreigner, Australian Boehm is already training in Ústí.
What does it look like?
I happen to know him, at the universiade we played against each other in the group.
And we had a couple of times there, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the games, so we already know each other in a friendly way.
We beat them 3:1, I immediately poured it to him at the start of the summer preparation in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Z are still arriving.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been texting with the American, he looks like a nice guy, the Brazilian knows how he's going to speak English.
Did you contact the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recorder, the one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of players they were, I found on the Internet playing, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the boy jumps, he's tall.
We wrote some messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he fits in with us.
How are you looking forward to the position of the recorder?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I will be twenty-four and I have no character to switch to it.
I'd rather be in the center of the action, I prefer to run the team rather than led by someone else.
I probably wouldn't want to play anymore if I had to be like a second recorder and devote myself to it at full time. When something is not done to the fullest, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Six months in Příbram, when it wasn't Kustic as a captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems and he left.
We've been climbing up since then, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, of which I am a young man, I alternated one and two.
An excellent year was in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and chose Příbram.
Budweiser wanted me from there, I stayed, but I didn’t finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short position is the Phelps domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is sweet as always," Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and his mother cheered again in the auditorium, this time the son Boomer slept peacefully with his headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming competitively and in a few hours it'll be over, he said moved.
In the final behind Phelps by almost two seconds, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagigo, who won the long position.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (display) and Carl Lewis (distance) Michael Phelps is the third athlete to dominate the same discipline at four games in a row.
For most of the race, other American Ryan Lochte and home-grown Thiago Perreira stayed at the lead with Phelps.
While the gold defender in the final round fifty put on a crushing finish, they fell outside the medal positions.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand its unique medal collection.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the position of the position, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter-long butterfly race.
The legend could not be overshadowed by compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the signing doubles double track after a hundred.
In the final, he left 37 hundredths of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third ended up Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While from last year's World Championships Murphy has only fifth place out of two hundred, he became a sign-making king in Rio.
From the imaginary throne dethroned Larkin, who managed the same double at last year's world championships.
He won a medal at the Olympics only now.
Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared the gold on the Kralařská Hundred.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiak it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuelová the second after silver from the relay.
She won the Swim Gold at the Olympics as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport will become a love for them and they will get to where I go, said the touched Manuel.
The third was the Swedish woman Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-meter-meter butterfly race in Rio in the world record and has silver from the two-hundredths of the rounding.
The sixth time was the world record holder Australian Cate Campbell.
The boob double hundred was won by Japan's Riee Kanet, for which it is the first Olympic medal at the age of twenty-seven.
She has no precious metal even from the World Championships, its maximum was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Yulia Yefimova, who is struggling with the animosity of spectators and rivals due to the start of the Games despite the doping past.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
I'm so tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was enforced only by the special panel of the CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the Games.
They dealt with my appeal and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, let them go to the arbitration court, she added.
Hermannová: Disappointment, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
Less than an hour before the game, they learned who they were coming against.
They had to make a quick-to-tie try.
And then, in unconventional time, the match began on a small court number 1.
The first set did not start well, then they finished the lead of the opponents, but at the state of 19:19 they did not manage the endgame.
In the second they were clearly better and levelled, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
Above all, a number of broken services meant a loss of 10:15 and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermannová said.
How would you evaluate the match?
Hermannová: After an unfortunate start, before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, my income was lost in the last ball, which I had become accustomed to before.
We lost a set, which was key.
In the next set we got on them with an overview on the pitch, with a different defense and we pushed on the service.
There was a very bad serve in the tie-break, that's where we dropped off on this page.
It was disappointing because we could beat the Russians.
Sluková: Too bad at the beginning of the first set, we missed it there.
We were able to download it, but the points were missing.
The second set was great and in the third he decided the service.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and it was about the five, we hesitated a lot there.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play on the little court number 1?
Sluková: Similar to China in the by-backyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock at night, complete silence, the music didn't play, nothing.
That was the difference from the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn't do tactical preparation as for the other teams.
But Simon (coach Nausch) prepared tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of papers with tactics ready, so we were pretty well prepared in this side.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at half past eleven, but not at twelve.
The block of Russian Birlov in the preliminary round of the play-offs at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannová in the hug in the preliminary round of the playoffs at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group from ten, we had the regime shifted before.
This was two hours more.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance at twelve o'clock.
But I think we've prepared our best as we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not typical and it probably won't be my favorite time to play.
How do you assess the Olympic experience?
Hermannová: Since the procedure from the group was our goal, it is on the one hand fine, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep from it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big brother is here, the first surveillance SIM is coming.
You won't escape her.
The new rules are intended to apply to all those without a Thai passport who decide to acquire a SIM of one of the local operators when staying in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who work in Thailand, for example, or have married there.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and the Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The plan for the sale of SIMs intended exclusively for foreigners was introduced to the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measure, which will allow their location to be monitored, intends to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasit, this is a means of maintaining national security that will allow the criminal activity committed by foreigners to deal with.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs should help to detect even people who exceed the allowed length of stay.
At dealers, special SIMs for foreigners should appear at the side of the SIM exclusively designed exclusively by Thais.
The aspect will be the viewing function, which will be permanently switched on for cards designated persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This SIM feature isn't for Thais, because we can always track them easily," Tantasath added.
It should be added that in Thailand, prepaides are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators handed out free starter SIMs to tourists at airports.
They were fully anonymous.
Ten telecoms regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are also considering the introduction of the same measure as Thailand.
Even in them, the mandatory registration of SIM currently applies, however, the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the forthcoming measure does not require foreigners to acquire the SIM of a local operator when entering the country.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case Thai authorities will be short on them.
Operators of the country know only relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after logging in the SIM to their network.
They know the phone number, but not information about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to local operators’ rates is so abysmal that most tourists start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities’ efforts to oversee the movement of foreigners have been legally criticized by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in connection with the protection of privacy, compares the forthcoming system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if necessary to monitor a specific person.
Unspecified punishment will be imminent for any abuse of the system.
"If the service provider monitors the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with the crime," Tantasath added.
In addition, the system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number is currently recycled only after the 90-day period, after which the SIM did not log in to the network, the number could be renewed after fifteen days if Thailand left.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a whirlpool on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the care of the property is provided by the administrator.
The condition was enough parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older buildings.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking the floor, high energy intensity and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old development is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová with her colleague Kamila Poláková from the Artiga studio.
Why did you reach out to them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to everyone?
Cooperation with the architect would be recommended to everyone, if he designs an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the design of the interior itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials, and based on the client’s wishes, they are able to match the interior appropriately.
We cooperated with the architect Lenka Langerová already on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even when reconstructing our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-residential space with adequate facilities for a family of four conceived as a modern, but not cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and to realize intelligent home control.
And, of course, it was necessary to ensure the quality of the execution.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you interfere with the final form of the interior?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from the architects.
At the beginning, we set what we expect from the design, and showed some interior elements that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors, including the works of Karel Malich, Karel Vyschal, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, the architect helped to orientate himself in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the idea of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then verified whether everything is tuning together with the help of visualizations.
Have there been any complications in the implementation of which you had to give up the original ideas, or vice versa, to accept new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned would actually be shielding the surrounding buildings.
At that time, we literally changed the layout overnight from the ground up.
On the kitchen counter and for the lining of the fireplace wall, granite was used.
In the interior, wooden surfaces complemented by leather, for example, for the upholstery of the Dining and bar chairs Norma from Arper, prevail.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes or is there anything you wish you had differently today?
I believe that it is a modern air interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
We are not going to make changes, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the plane of the shielding and settling of the terraces.
Perhaps the only rebuke is to the floor, when walnut wood turns out to be too delicate for the household with a dog.
The Word of the Architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the top floor of a new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout solution and several other modifications.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of sun tunnels in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This gives us daylight to the darker areas of the apartment.
Also, direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the construction modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which made me get to work in a magazine.
Why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I was choking in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere among people.
I thought every Frenchman was very negative.
People in France are negatively attuned in general, but lately it has gotten even worse.
Interestingly, you mention negativism.
This is how some people value the Czech character.
Believe me, you are not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not find it that way when they come to France, because they don’t see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
A big topic is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
There is also a problem with people’s behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street I was living in, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through my fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel comfortable in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job anywhere else and I came across a vacancy with Air France here in Prague.
I have to admit that I did not know Prague at first.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn’t know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch some negative reactions or swearing, but I feel like people are freer here.
That I can do anything, dress in any way, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you uncomfortably, for example, when you have special clothes and the like.
I started to feel really single in Prague.
Praguers don’t think they care about such things.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for a while for one travel site.
Then, with another friend, we set up a website where people offer and are looking for shared housing.
So far we operate only in Prague, but we would like to expand it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends who are half Czech and two more friends of Czech.
I have to say that the next specificity of the Czechs is that they initially hold their distance more.
He won't let anyone in the body.
That's quite a difference from the place where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned not to speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in curfews or in food.
I want to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by the fact that everyone can communicate at least a little bit in English, I do not need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're Muslim?
Basically, no.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My leader, the Czech woman, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense of: They are not French, but Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But that someone would have a problem with being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
Even though a colleague once alerted me to some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said not to go downtown, that they'd be swearing at me.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that anything can happen anywhere these days.
Until recently, I could not have imagined that something like this had happened in France.
This is not just for Muslims.
Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur'an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists shield themselves with your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even if I shouldn't feel that way.
I try not to follow the reports of violence, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that is not my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met in Jiřího z Poděbrad Square.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they do not agree with the violence.
I don't think they have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My collaborators are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a bit more religiously based than me, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam, because we all perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, they taught Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of women.
How do you see it?
I don't feel subordinate in any way.
Rather the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It also has to do with the fact that you do not wear a headgear.
For example, a hijabi?
And it mainly reflects the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a really principled Muslim.
They pray five times a day, but the scarf just doesn't wear.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone as they interpret it.
When you read the Koran, you should make up your own mind about these things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, “I am not the Prophet’s wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the headscarves require, I take it.
Do you plan to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I feel great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
The yachtsman Kozel Fenclová wind in Rio blew on the progression rungs.
Friday's rides at sea in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, came out to Czech yachtsman Veronica Kozelska Fencl.
In the Laser Radial class, it moved up to 10th place before the final two races.
This would ensure the Czech participation in the final race.
You collect packages as pokémon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
Behind the idea to use already planned trips for transporting shipments are TV director Matěj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, they breathed life into three applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the national Převez app in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities recorded in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first than we will focus more on abroad, says a forty-one-year-old manager in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How does the Transfer I App and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data on how much you can transport the package and how much you want for it.
Someone is asking for a transfer on that day.
When the route and time of delivery are convenient, it is paired and both come with a mutual notification.
At that moment, the chat opens, where the pair arranges the handover.
How many people would have to register by estimating so that each package always finds their courier?
I do not know the ideal state, I cannot estimate how many registered and how many trips are needed to make the coverage absolutely optimal and each supply is paired with demand.
It already works on the main roads and it is logically easier than on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building their trust in the meantime and find that no one will run away with the package.
Have you had to deal with such a case yet?
How many users does the service have two months after launch?
At the moment, we have about 5 to 6 thousand people who create paths.
We consider this a success and we believe that more will be packed.
Is there a risk that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be a competition for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the matter the same day and for a fraction of the price.
At a large company for delivery within two hours, you will pay several thousand.
Here you pay a hundred or less, because that is the way someone already does.
Should traditional carriers be worried about the possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope it will be so.
The market has huge potential, huge multinational carriers feed here, as well as retail chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that the quality does not match what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox saying they have to pick up the shipment at the branch, first that day after 19 o'clock.
At that time, I had been in need of the package for six hours and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that will not annoy anyone and sends a signal to the competition, let them try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither of them ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a manager of the music club, Matěj Liška as a TV director.
In 2014, they began to prepare the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already scheduled travel between the world’s capitals, primarily by plane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three-quarters of a year and launched the app in March 2016.
They started developing the Transfers app in December last year and released in May this year.
It is a local version of Shippansee modified for the Czech market.
The application Mesík and Mesík Profi have been developing since January this year and made it available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications, which one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The sharing economy has been a theme lately, and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Aren't you worried about working in an area that no one can say much about where the line of sharing is and where the grey economy is?
It's the same, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if it is successful and we go up with it, we will be the next thorn in the side of the gray economy.
But even though someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to circumvent tax authorities and tax controls.
Every user, either on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make a receipt out of it.
What do you think the service has so much potential?
The sender saves money and the ferry earns, or lowers the cost of the trip.
This is the strong idea that brings together the interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we would like this to bring this one closer.
Nice stories can be created, people are happy to help someone and talk about it.
Maybe someone will deliver forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
In my opinion, people have been lacking in personal approach for a long time, we say about this app that it is a service of people to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package does not run away?
Each user of the application together with registration scans the identity card and provides a bank connection, a credit or credit card.
These are the channels that give service and man credibility.
Couriers also collect asterisks based on the sender's rating.
We also offer insurance, we still tune the details.
The courier is liable for an uninsured shipment in the event of loss or damage, but under the criminal law, he does not take responsibility for the content if there is anything illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a submachine gun or ten kilos of hashish in a closed package in his suitcase, he is ambushable.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, traceable by the administrative authority, which is the only one who will be able to consult it, nor are we ourselves able to see them, the data are protected against abuse.
How much money does a courier get after successful delivery of the shipment?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender is charged by a few percent extra for mediating contact.
This money is our profit, but it is only a few percent, because we want to push for volume.
Also, no one can charge the courier for not delivering the shipment when he actually delivered it, the takeover and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We've got three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and a big as a bass of beer.
After that, there is no further restriction and if someone has a seat in the car, he will transport the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier can see what he wants.
You don’t even have to pack the thing if you don’t want to hide the content.
You stick the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to launch the service?
My friend got the idea more than two years ago, I didn’t pay much attention to it at that time.
Then he showed me a demo application with a transnational range, which mainly targets passengers of the plane.
At that moment I told him that I would not look for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put savings into it.
The next year took the development than we founded Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the entire product.
But this is not a version that you are now focusing on.
No, we focused marketing on the Czech Republic, where we try to catch the application, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to respond to customer feedback and we are not so much addressing the foreign market at the moment.
We know it's a long-dalact run, but we don't rush, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippanse LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgraded.
I will take it arose when we said that the national segment can be much more interesting and that we will at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application Mesík is local, for the city.
But it can send the package to the exact address to the other side of the world.
It works for the sender as well as I take over, but the difference is that as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your mobile.
We called the application for couriers who want to make a living from this, we called Messík Profi.
So someone can make money by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the last application in Prague will be downloaded by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the way to work.
As everyone is fooling around with those Pokémon now, they can collect exactly the same.
One sees where there are orders around the city, come to it, click and see when it has to be delivered and transports the shipment.
It's set cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be crucial for companies to send shipments, fill in the data about them on the website, so they will create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them every month.
Are you currently working on the project full-time?
It's getting used to it, but we normally have it at work to feed and develop the project.
There is no strong multinational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other stimuli and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage with us to manage not the Czech market, but who should go with us to the global product with us and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is meant to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part, and the solo game will be more varied in it, according to the first information than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is to be based on the concept of the network action in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, includes the possibility of using a battle titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will include levels aimed at skilful movement.
They will resemble platformers and include puzzles.
Double jumps, running on walls and rope slips are essential to overcome them.
Sometimes it will be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will also be maps resembling mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and slide down the platforms and close massive doors.
You will modify the form of a battlefield.
The pace of the game should oscillate between fierce action and calmer moments to explore an unknown planet.
We'll play as Jack Cooper's path, dreaming of a career as a pilot.
Cooper crashes on the alien planet Typhon, along with Captain Lastimos, inhabited by enemy soldiers, at the start of the campaign.
And the wilderness will not be indulgent about him.
In addition, Lastimos suffers fatal blows in the crash, and Cooper is tasked with putting the captain's titan in operation.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot's repair.
Cooper's calls with the titan will also be significant.
It will serve as a source of information about the soldier’s past, but at the same time humorous moments will be created by robot-depersonalized communication.
For example, if the titan is dryly listing all the injuries that Cooper faces during the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was provided by the server Polygon.
In addition, the result will be possible to assess in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is 28. October, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes alive, but the original label remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the THQ publishing house, in 2013 it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
Nordic released, for example, Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
In addition, there are 23 more games for the publishing house and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, by the time I was retiring, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a twenty-year-old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - at first she obviously tried for him for a long time, then they got together.
She's such a big guy, probably her type, because she walked with the like in front of me.
She's completely crazy about him.
On those first days, her voice even changed, she had a girl's, in love.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I watched the whole thing.
He went from work regularly at half past four, so she always went shopping at three.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later, I found out that they were meeting in his house, in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were there.
I got my keys, decided to catch them there.
But I don't know why, in the end I always stayed at home.
I never got there to take the decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife thoughtfully controlled me.
I soon found out that I was handling, that I would do what she wanted.
And I did it.
Maybe I'm just a slip.
At the time, my neighbors told me that he knew about it.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all burst, it would be bad.
That it would affect everyone in the family, only the daughter knew something.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But once I went to his apartment, that I needed help with something in the laundry room.
He went there with me and I told him that I had been anonymous, that he was meeting with my wife and that everything was instructed.
I asked him what he was going to tell me.
He was standing there, shrugging, staring at the ground, not saying a word.
Then, at that time, I met his wife on the way home from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to that, and she didn't tell me anything.
No one told me anything then.
I'm a person who's never gone anywhere, who has a hard time getting to know someone, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about the divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this and life would go on.
But that wasn't the case.
And I've never really come to terms with all of this.
To this day, I still have it in me.
I used to show her a lot, but in the end I left it for peace.
He continues to live in the house next door and I continue to live with her.
It's just more than my wife, my housekeeper.
At home, she always did everything - she cooked, washed, she cleaned.
She's hardworking.
I think she always tried to have no other reason to complain.
And you could say he's kind, too.
But sometimes I want to caress her, hug her, and she won't let her.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
She once told me she never loved me.
That she had and likes me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him to this day, he is her god.
And I don't enjoy that kind of life.
Even then, when it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree with it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
After the terrorist attacks, France is escalating the fight against radical Islamists and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their faith," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only the spiritual educated in France preach in the country.
It also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, when the money often comes with preachers inoculated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls plans to set up a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then-premises prime minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, it was supposed to contribute to the more transparentity of the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But she was soon struck by internal contradictions, and she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation will likely be the former interior and defence minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, known as a supporter of the secular state.
In France, there are about 2500 mosques and prayer halls, about 120 of them serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clergymen from the country and are considering this step for several dozens more.
This week, German police also cracked down against jihadist clerics.
The imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where the faithful allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015, a debate broke out in France about a new institution that will replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All this has been hasty by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also oversees the imams.
However, it is not yet clear where he will get funding, even though several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, i.e. mainly for meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
This tax would be paid in practice by the sellers of halal food, for granting a permit.
Part of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who will go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30 thousand of them go on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia from France.
In addition, only preachers who have undergone educational programs at local universities should operate in the French mosques.
Thanks to this, their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"We have closed twenty of them from December and others will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"In France, there is no place for those who preach hatred and disregard the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly injured by an unknown gunman on Friday morning at a shopping mall in Zaragoza, Spain, the Independent reports.
The shooting occurred after the woman and daughter left the garage in her car.
The man waited in the car in front of the shopping mall, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, reports the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, an ambulance had to come for a man in critical condition.
The crime took place around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Citing the Spanish news agency Europa Press, the Independent reports that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Threads with asparagus, wakame eyelashes, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes light, well digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so from the summer gardens smell grilled necks, pork pork neck.
Nothing very healthy, not very light, even sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
True, grilling is economical for time and dishes, moreover, it is a social thing and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make well-delicacies that special dining, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook anything long, bake, fry or stew anything.
They will contribute to our health.
Whether it is homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-adodopted griffles are enough to make the preparation fun and food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
There is even a need for more time-consuming cooking and cooling rice.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment, and then it depends only on the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
There's no eyelash like an eyelash.
The advantage of a number of Asian dishes today is that raw materials are usually commonly available.
Including pickled sweet-sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the real pink gary zafer has a unique spicy sharp and at the same time delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several kinds of vinegar and zigzag.
So it is enough to buy a bag of the appropriate size, and a side dish with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes within a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America also as an "tool" for the preparation of various baked, cooked and fried foods that are packed in them similarly to aluminum foil.
The banana leaf then gives the dish a specific flavor.
In our country, they can be bought in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, choose only the leaves of deep green, and therefore healthy - uncracked and without stains.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad from wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought frozen again.
Who often eats or prepares sushi, you will probably know especially the algae nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed from which it is produced by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called leaves of nori − i.e. slices intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame − dark green algae growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido − it is also fresh and dried and as popular as the algae nori.
By the way, who does not know miso soup with wakame, supposedly Asian women have been using it from time immemorial to recover after childbirth.
And this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents graying of the hair and is literally packed with minerals.
Dried and beaten wakame also serves as a spice, for example, to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to infuse in the water, then rinse, put in boiling water and cook for half a minute.
Then it cools down in ice water, cuts out the center ribs and continue to be prepared, like a favorite salad.
However, buying it already ready, frozen, is the simplest solution.
All that remains is to wrap a roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a bomb of longevity.
If you resist and do not throw in extra grilled pork belly.
Eat healthy, light and summery.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh meal that deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done in a moment two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of cucumber, 60 g wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of chilli sauce, 20 g mango and 40 g of pickled garbage ginger, a little pine nuts.
First, prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we remove it and wait until it softens.
Meanwhile, in hot water, we simmer the asparagus sprouts briefly, after about three minutes we let them cool down quickly into the icy water so that they do not lose color.
Put the vegetable filling on the allowed paper and pack.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumber, which we cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chilli sauce, add the chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
Put the asparagus sprouts on the banana leaf, add the rolls and finally decorateli the whole dish with wakame algae, with pickled ginger, slice mango, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-square rugby, Fiji selection takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in seven-inch rugby ended in a devastating hitchhiking at the last hurdle, Fiji defeated the British at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio at a high of 43:7 in the final match on Thursday night.
The Fijors gave a master lesson in processing, landfill, evasions, support game, running on the line and brute force - and they won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unfamiliated prize of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain third on a given day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of the seven-gage rugby, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A 7:5 win over the South Africans in the semi-finals the same day is maybe in the final.
However, Fiji would also beat a 15-member team in full health in its form.
It is not going to be a consolation for the British, but they may rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the lead coach of the Fijo-manes is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
The UK has traveled a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every game in Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, the penetrations of the British rebounded for joy.
For captain Tom Mitchell and other teammates, it was like running behind a series of buses on the move and the World Cup champions led 5:0 when Osasa Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The timer showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, from which there was a conversion.
12:0 and Britain has made it hard to touch the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the giant Leon Nakaraw and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only slowed the Fijoans.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another after returning, and there was still more than 1 minute left on the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouva then broke through the bare-came Britons and rushed to the lane where he scored.
The conversion to 29:0 was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji had been born for rugby 7s while the British were still learning to pass.
That's exactly how it is.
The British made mass changes after half-time and stopped the onslaught of the Fijo-women... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after a brilliant-up play by Fiji Josua Tuisov, he continued to penetrate.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown into the left corner to increase the not 36:7. But the game was long ago won by the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands, and their fans sang on the galleries, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely joyful approach of the Fijians.
In the closing moments, Mata Viliame further attempted to sweeten the Fijans' victory.
A whistle came from, the Fijo-shuffed Fijoms hugged, and the British fell on the turf completely beaten.
Before that, the same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semifinals, and the UK defeated South Africa in a tight semi-final - the difference between one conversion.
Kyle Brown took the South Africans into the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the defensive line thanks to his dazzling foot work and scored under the hook in the second half.
The great late landfill of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony from England's fifteenth team, secured the victory - and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the fight of a cancer to win the rowing race
You won't find more emotional gold on these Games - and that's something to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing exhales in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though two of them were sitting at the oar, there were three voices in the ship. When the ship whizzed across the surface towards the second Olympic gold behind in a women's pairs race, there was a voice of the still-present coach Robin Williams with them in the boat. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying on the water surface with the elegance of swans - does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
Behind every gold medal of rowing is a batalion of helping hands, which, piece by piece, make a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who didn't know if he would live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer that can be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It will change your perspective.
The cancer was detected in December 2013.
The happiness for the whole trio was that he could have undergone treatment at the beginning of 2014, in the off-season, and thus shorten the outage to a minimum - if we can call it that in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get myself together quickly.
That was an impetus.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said they were saying a few steps is enough.
That's how it started.
Linging in itself is the way, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual, as he attempted to manage his own unease.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiments behind her mission in Afghanistan, said: "I've been down with emotion this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
Once again, it emphasizes how much it means to me, how much Helen and Robin worked for me, and so did Robin.
Until now, it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so he deserves a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were focused at the most at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we did not want to achieve something fabulous.
We were not looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to whiskey well, go out and win the race, which we managed to do.
The couple will take a year to think about before deciding what happens next.
Glover is getting married next week, her future is TV adventurer Steve Backsharall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took approximately six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling about it," she said.

Prison?
Rather, let him drive people for free, says the manager of the taxima Rubeš to the landmark indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate clerk in Prague are, as ČT reported, the defendants.
You have made a series of reports in which you have uncovered the fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in the group that will stand trial.
You faced a few unpleasant skirmish encounters with exposed actors.
How much is the news of the prosecution of the members of the organized group is a landmark for you?
I expected a court to happen.
I am particularly curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail.
That's useless.
Primarily, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by bringing all people for free.
This is a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean that you do not see any punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a ping, another delivers pizza, and one completely bailed on it.
The defendants can theoretically receive two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
I have a problem with impaling freedom.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the companies they have taken from it.
For a quarter of a century, they have done the fact that they destroyed our country's name and dirty robbed people.
Let them make a good card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a community service.
As someone, they go to collect garbage, they would get a car and they would drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll get probation in the end, and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and subsequently at Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
He is one of the people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the Stream.cz internet television, where he participates in a number of shows, is now preparing the Prague Guide program, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, Rubeš advises on which services to avoid in Prague and what, on the contrary, he recommends to use without any worries.
Previously, he filmed a series with the names How to do it, City of Fraud?, Life in Luxury, A Enough! and Prague vs. The money.
They are referred to as an organized group in the indictment.
The police followed her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as a mafia?
They are such cute mafiosi, not as we know from the Godfather.
It's more about the mafiosi - juniors, but they are certainly organized.
Just in that they guard each other's stepladders (taxiric habitats).
Prague is all sorted.
I have tracked that, for example, the main railway station does not like Paris, Parisskaya does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everyone just watches their place and every group is somehow organized.
It's probably a convoluted network.
But there are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate official who warned the driver of scrutiny.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon from the streets has not disappeared.
What percentage of Prague fraudsters in the taxi service, according to your estimate, is this?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst on the street are still.
I'm talking, for example, about Aleš Ryjáček.
This is a person who is really dangerous - in his car he carries a telescopic baton, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by the Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I went with him, he asked me seven hundred in three kilometers.
His police did not hold up for some reason.
Only a few people from the whole big group were selected.
However, the situation is the same in other locations in Prague.
Thus, the prosecution of seven people is difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague mischief, which seems to have much larger dimensions.
Of course, it's completely useless.
It will help, but all evil is not eradicated, that is true.
Do taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists still in the same places that you showed in reports, i.e. at the Charles Bridge or in Pařížská Street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations, they stand every day and violate the ordinances every day.
This is ignored by both the municipal police and the Prague City Hall.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's a complete indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Nevertheless, some of them, even if it is only part of the group, will go on trial.
It's a breakthrough.
I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be for the center of Prague to improve.
And while I feel like I need a little better, I will continue to do so.
We need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
This cannot be content.
But it's not the case, of course there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught a taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was 56 crowns (used the trick with a decimal point).
He had a receipt for it, the police arrived, and this taxi driver was so cute that he was still walking to those police officers and asking them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taximeter glued the decimal point and robbed tourists by 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the audacity of fraudulent taxi drivers did not back down even after you showed the faces of those who charged nonsensical amounts for a short ride in your footage?
Their audacity is still incredible.
What happened to the taxi driver hoping for 56 crowns?
Police sent him away saying they could not discuss him at the scene because he issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem even in the court (six taxi drivers and one ex-official).
On the one hand, there will be a taxi driver with his receipts, on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the municipality may not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I filmed parts about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage in the report.
Are you concerned that this fact could protect them from the court?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver could ride for six or ten crowns per kilometer, because he would not make a living from it.
You talked about a trick with a dime that fraudulent taxi drivers move, especially in front of foreign clients.
Is it still up to date, or are they afraid to continue using this trick after the publication of your reports?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
I recently went with a taxi driver, bracing in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that black cardboard from the side of the taximeter.
When I ask him what he has, he said, "You know what it is."
If the taxi driver-fraudsters did not work too much fines, can they be vaulted by the court with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can discourage them from fraud?
You talked about the fact that you think they would always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should be more to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that fortunately the fair taxi drivers in Prague prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack um.
They can't walk in much and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they held the demonstration (because of the proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it did not sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said they were not protesting against Uber, that they just want to have the same terms as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and only the best possible advertisement for Uber was created.
How do you evaluate the overall approach of the Prague City Hall in solving the problem of overpriced fares?
It is clear that the criminal police had to come into it to solve something.
The magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole that was leaking information, that is, the taxi department was doing its job for several years completely unnecessarily.
I hope they charge the official to the last check all the thwarted controls to realize what he's done.
That's the worst thing for me to do.
I was even on one control drive with him, which I found out only from their schedule.
It has been several months since the publication of the latest episodes of the series.
What's the response?
I think especially of foreign viewers, on what is actually the most focused series.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play the videos.
And when we walk around the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people who can be seen in the footage are really standing there.
The famously famous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put a fence around them so people can look at them.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need to?
Yeah, yeah.
I ride with services where I don’t have to pay in cash, but by card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no fraud.
But there are also many dispatching centers that are fair.
I only took a taxi on the street once since.
The driver said to me, "I mean, you have the courage."
Bém dressed as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were mentioned in 2005.
Former Mayor Pavel Bém set off on a control ride in disguise as an Italian tourist in the same year and on the first attempt the driver cheated him by two hundred.
But the editor Rubeš had worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for driving from Staroměstský to Wenceslas Square, which is about 195 crowns per kilometer calculated by the creators of the reports.
The Prague City Hall set a maximum price at 28 crowns per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the recorded reportage: for example, a two-kilometre road from Pařížská Street to Truhlářská cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For a ride on Anděl, which has 2.5 kilometers, they charge even six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
Dirting from it goes well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be taken from the folds.
It is not easy and it does not go quickly, the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in Háje approached her work.
Hats off to it: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb countless times and climb down again.
"The restor should be meticulous, patient and unpretentious to the working environment," she said.
This is far from the first restoration work in the Frýdlant region.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the rear wing of the Frýdlant town hall were restored, the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Piet in Frýdlantská Okružní Street, Mariánské pole in Frýdlant or Atlanta in the facade of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
The restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Kryštof and Kateřina from Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned of the build-up of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts will be secured against falling and displacement; either they will anchor into the wall or with each other.
They also have to treat and preserve the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be golden again.
"Then it will begin with gilding the inscriptions on marble slabs with pure slice gold," said Věra Sobotová, a member of the State Monument Care of the Municipal Authority in Frýdlant.
There's no record from the past that the tombstone has undergone any repairs.
On closer inspection, they take a captivate of holes, drilled in marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and they're remnants of the decoration of the tombstone.
It was richly adorned, unfortunately after the raid of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
They literally combed the tombstone, Sobotová noted.
In the church Finding the Holy Cross, restorers are with a slight exaggeration as at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put the tombstones in order, which were underwater, the baptismal font, murals in the tomb and now the tombstone were restored.
"We would also like to go to the stained glass in the future," Sobotova said.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Regenerov tombstone will cost a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not deposit any of its money into this part of the restoration.
One hundred thousand crowns will go just from the win in the regional round of the Historical City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, clarified the mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The release of the win for the restoration of the tombstone was decided by the council.
Opinions of experts on the future development of selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in the horizon of one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The S&P500, which was going through 12% of its corrections in February, is now at a new all-time high and has already gained 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interest of central banks in the long term, which have always reached their own in the end.
In a situation where U.S. stocks are at an all-time high, volatility is disappearing again, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets grew happily and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the US central bank and, as today, the volatility index (VIX) has remained steadily below the threshold of 12 percent.
And not to, too.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is underway, and last week has also put its hand to the Bank of England, which will buy £70 billion bonds in the coming six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing pushes even lower yields and contributes to the near-performing elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
Of course, this is a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and China is stabilizing, and Brexit is no longer a topic, so we probably should not be too surprised if U.S. stocks continue to stay in a similarly calm regime.
Too bad Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very glad that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, European Commission chief Juncker said when the French politician (truly experienced, because he was cleverly propelled by so many different supranational political positions that we would find a better example of the so-called European elite) was best-seeing to seek the European Commission's main negotiator of the conditions of the UK's exit from the EU.
Juncker’s selection blew out hints of hopes that it was in the EU’s serious interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with the UK.
However, most of the British media have adopted the name Barnier as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a rocky federalist.
He hates the UK.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He conceived it as only he could hold it: the obstinate enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
The supporter of multilateral regulations was the co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union and grudges against everything that comes from the London financial center City pushed for the legislation of the overly harsh regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, adamant and apparently reckless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How in this context not to remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation, to which the balance sheet, overview and the empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is why today Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Vaclav Klaus - at least in this one.
It would be for everyone's good!
Earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin has released his loved one Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday released Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office.
Anton Vajno takes his place.
This was reported by the Russian media, citing the announcement of the Kremlin's press service.
Putin has suggested that he was releasing Ivanov at his own request.
During the meeting, broadcast by Rossiya 24 television station, the president said he was meeting Ivanov's wishes when he took office, that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The news of the exchange at the head of the president's administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current representative, Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is described as one of Putin's closest associates.
This former KGB officer, for example, has held the posts of Secretary of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister in the past.
He will now also leave the seat of a member of the president's security council.
But Ivanov said during a meeting with Putin that he was actually a record-breaker at the head of the administration of the head of state.
He lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already been replaced in this position.
Neither Kvitova nor the doubles Strýcová and Šafářová will play the final.
So far, neither of their tennis matches has been turned into a final turnout.
Petra Kvitova lost her first fight, succumbing to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puigová after sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitova was followed by the Czech doubles players Šafářová and Strýcová after a while.
Although the Williams sisters’ slayers reached for the win in the first set, they missed two setbols and the Russians eventually captured the set in a shortened game.
The second set was lost by 4:6.
The Czech rowing scored half the success in the morning program in Rio: skier Ondřej Synek won his semi-final when he beat the second Damir Martin from Croatia despite slowing down by almost a second in the end.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind has calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, Synek said.
Unlike him, his rivals had to fight for advancement.
So it took some strength away from them, it could be easier for them tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the rower of Prague's Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not walk in Snyk's footsteps.
The thirty-five-year-old rower took fourth position in today's semifinals in her ride and on Saturday she will start in the B final and the fight for 7th to 12th place.
Gold from London will not be defended.
I didn't make it to the final for the first time in the Olympics.
I'm a little bit sorry, but on the other hand, I went a quality race and I put everything I could into it.
The opponents were simply better, Topinková Knapková bent in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed she would get to her fourth games among the elite six.
She gave up the fight just before the finish.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could get out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could advance to the finals through the Austrian.
Unfortunately, she went a life race today, said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained a young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who did not manage to break out of qualifying for the second time, this time the foore in the lie.
Nepejchal took 33rd place in it.
Qualifying was the best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky with 629 points, Kiril Grigorjan (628.9) advanced from the first place.
Nepejchal's shot was worth 620.5 points.
For the first time, athletes also spoke to the program in Rio, including Czech sandemiers Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachová is 11th place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is the twenty-second.
It is led by British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as the second Belgian Nafissata Thiam.
Both took care of the best high-altitude performance in the heptathlon.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Apart from the absurdity of the question asked this question: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, while the Russians have not.
In both great Eurasian peoples, dictators appeared in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed to the 94 million victims of communism, cited by the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare or inhumane experiments.
The Nazis inhumanly wiped out about 6 million Jews, and the total victims of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocillations.
In Germany or in the USSR, not only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, either actively, passively or just by cowardice or sticking its head in the sand.
This is not just the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal, came immediately ending the war.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: Daddy, Grandfather, why did you take part in such atrocities?
How could you do it!
This brought a real reflection and healing of society.
Until recently, the German elites mainly took care of the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly do not need to add back Alsace-Lotrin or someone - to revanch - militarily think of it - may be recognized by everyone.
After losing the Cold War in Russia, there was no big reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was finally closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The politics of Putin's Russia is the revanch, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and the future of one’s own people are no value to the universe.
Beat yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that this is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - predetermined to Asian (self-self) tyranny.
Who benefits from the rise in tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation has deteriorated at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimean region.
Who is the growth of tensions good for?
After a prolonged period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia were again deteriorated.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side was the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the news from both opposing sides contradicts and it is difficult to independently verify them, so we only have the opportunity to think about the old known question to whom does it benefit?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of members of Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia came from the case of pilot Savchenko a well-known response that they were allegedly hijacked on the territory of Russia.
If we accept the Ukrainian version, what would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: in nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly by the West in the form of further toughening of sanctions and intensifying the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, there has been a retreat from the situation in Ukraine against the backdrop of the immigration crisis into Europe.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost its credit in front of its residents, when the current support of President Poroshenko is around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have gone bankrupt long ago if it had not been for generous financial injections by the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention again to its country to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation in front of voters in their country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the power forces leadership again want to prove themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to a large Russia.
We can only hope that all those who are trying to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their huge responsibility for the lives of not only the soldiers, but of all ordinary people on both opposing sides and stopping their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria has reported inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value in a few years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero since October last year, when the positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, as measured by the CPI index, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous period of 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in the travels of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2 %), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices have fallen for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
U.S. intelligence agencies are said to have been tracking Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about Russian attacks came public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was dealing with an attack on the servers of the party headquarters of the Democrats.
However, no official report mentions the Russian involvement in the attack.
Moscow has denied involvement in the attack.
The report of the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because its disclosure would show that U.S. intelligence agencies are monitoring the hacking attack and the way they do and what sources they use could be revealed.
Two Russian intelligence services were involved in the attack.
New Advisory Council for Cyber Security
The material about the surveillance of the Russian footprint was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters reported.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight leading deputies of Congress were informed, called the gang of eight in the US.
It consists of the heads of both chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democrats' chairmen in both chambers Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Congressional Gatekeeping and Security Committees.
Acting Democratic Party leader Donna Brazil announced on Thursday that she is creating an advisory board for cybersecurity to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of Democratic Party's servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
On the initiative of the consumer for health problems after eating food Salmon wild smoked - pieces 100 g, the expiration date 22.11.2016 was carried out by Prague hygienists in Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Můstku.
The inspection found that the batch L230125622/T4 with the expiration date 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out, is no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the expiration date was taken 11.12.2016.
The presence of Anisakis spp was confirmed by the laboratory examination. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - the larvae in the body cavity or muscle of the fish are a strong allergen, and human-eagested larvae can penetrate through the gastric wall into the internal organs, Šticha said.
We are very sorry for our customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale and, as a precautionary measure, we withdrew all other batches of this item.
The misconduct occurred on the part of the supplier we are negotiating with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, Alberta spokeswoman Barbora Vanko told the news outlet.
If the customer has purchased this product, he can return it in any of the stores of the chain and receives money back.
Larvae destroys frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrňata.
Hygienists informed the Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration about the occurrence of the dangerous product.
According to the server bezpecnostpotravin.cz, people after ingesting the parasite can become ill with anisacosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can occur without symptoms, the Czech News Agency reported.
Symptoms occur an hour to two weeks after consumption of insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
Three weeks after the start of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leaves the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either with sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or when it is frozen.
Veterinarians have currently checked the salmon with the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had a parasite in them.
The shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Expanded, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, there has been 919 packages to date.
Currently, the unsold stocks of the product from stores are being drawn up, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal told the Czech News Agency on Friday.
Immediately after finding positive samples, veterinarians banned sending other products from the warehouse.
A seventeen-year-old British woman wanted to flee Raqqa, apparently killing her Russian airstrike.
After the initial enthusiasm and swift marriage to the jihadist, who was soon killed, a sobering came.
The expected caliphate paradise has been transformed for British girls into hell on a land from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister Hali, according to her relatives.
She repeatedly made the phone call to the UK and confided that she wanted to go back home.
To leave the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without thinking, The Telegraph quotes the lawyer of the family of the late girl Tasnim Akunjee as saying.
The last clues led to Raqqa, from there the girl last heard.
Then came only the news of her death, but it cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in east London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before it could flee because the house she was staying in was leveled in May with the country of the airstrike, Britain's ITV News reported.
Television added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that was attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You could bear the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area, Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer, said.
In the week when (Caedia) she was thinking about fleeing the territory of the Islamic State, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think she interpreted it (Kadiza) as a warning and decided not to take any chances, according to the BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with her 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abbas, set off on a journey of 17. February last year.
At home, they said they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from it through Turkey to the territory controlled by IS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in her power to get Kadica back.
You could bear the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could, tensile all the strength to get her daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing, according to him, is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent case for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, they realized how things are there, understood how far it differs from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and they wanted to return," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadizi's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also paused, their families have to accept that they are most likely dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to prison without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the regional center and the seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the mid-18th century, courts have been held at the town hall and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts dwelt were pitiful and many prisoners attempted to escape.
A lot of them successfully.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the premises of the prison to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, it had heating and gas lighting.
In one way, it was not in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, because smaller repair equipment was costly to operate and did not pay much.
Stories of Convicts and Ghost Hunts.
For the public, the prison opened a century later, visitors can compare the old building with a new one to see for themselves how different the conditions prevailed in them.
Guides in period costumes amplify the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can lock themselves in one of the cells, mostly for a photo in remembrance, or to evoke the feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray prison is one of Scotland's most famous sites where it supposedly haunts.
Several groups of paranormal activists have already gone there, and to this day the museum allows people to come to hunt for ghosts.
However, such a night will cost 300 pounds, which is about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
'Animé' effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by the anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality every day and play with the identity of ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a figure who seems to step out of the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any mistake will be released immediately.
Snapchat filters have earned criticism in the past accusations that the app promotes blackfacing or promoting white skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when this week offered users a filter that gave them oblique eyes, crooked teeth and inflated faces, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated controversial questions point to a bigger problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and outraged quickly spread, and Snapchat said the next day he had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of the accounts to the characters of the anime, not as a caricature of Asians.
But the observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded the painful stereotypes in action.
Others, without a bluntly, refused to compare with the anime.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea, whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that "it is hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and the effects of the filter.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is tightened to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural limits.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from meeting halls in corporations to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that’s offensive to some users,” said twenty-five-year-old Katie Zhuu in an interview on Thursday, “it’s hard for these things to go unnoticed today, as they used to be.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in an interview over the phone, she said she was confident that racially motivated problems reflect the lack of diversity in recruiting workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the bulky white, completely male management of the company, and the article ended with a hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either the case that they don’t have any diversity and colorful people among employees at the moment when these things are decided,” said Zhu, who has a Chinese-American origin, “or colored people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak.”
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures regarding the diversity of its employees, provided that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently recruited a recruiter who should focus on an underrepresented population and internal management of inclusion.
Zhuová adds: “I wonder if they really need other such users who can say it’s not okay,” adding that his account will remain cancelled.
Army Officers Misrepresent Intelligence Information on IS, Parliamentary Committee Says
In a report issued on Thursday, the parliamentary committee said that officers from the U.S. Central Command changed intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they were providing events from the country.
According to a preliminary report by the working group compiled by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense, "extensive discontent" among central intelligence analysts was found, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of the U.S. efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military central in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The statement said: "The outsets of intelligence agencies approved by Centcom's superior officers usually offered a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than confirmed by facts on earth, and were more consistent than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community."
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are harmed when a misalyy analysis is presented to the superiors of the policymakers," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and a Republican from California.
The failure in the leadership of Centcom goes back to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the persistent problems of the central staff in the description and analysis of U.S. efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While no decisive evidence is offered that the leaders of the Obama administration ordered the reports to be amended, the report said that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the central staff’s press releases, statements and statements from the congress were significantly more positive than what events were actually,” the report said.
Centcom's representative, for instance, has publicly stated that a major military attack to takeover of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq, remains under Islamic State control.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," MP Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Kansas Republican Party, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking U.S. intelligence staff handled the outputs of the staff's intelligence services to downplay the dangers of IS in Iraq.
Republicans formed a working group after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence information regarding the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday must be followed by a more detailed examination after further investigation.
There is another investigation in the intelligence services of Centcom, led by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republican working group.
“By 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created a very close process for compiling an assessment of IS information and Iraqi security forces,” representative Adam B said in a statement. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Deputy Democrat.
According to Adam Schiff, the process "veterled has distorted the outputs of intelligence services," he harmed the morale among analysts and "unsufficiently taken into account dissenting views."
However, Schiff and Democrats say they found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to “a model or political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon Inspector General, which was launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-chief Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the parliamentary report because the inspector general's investigation is still ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes do not agree on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue about these fundamental issues of national security.”
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the bombing of the American-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now proclaimed by an increasing number of defense officials).
However, last year's accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the fact that the Central Staff sincerely evaluates military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis venues.
Criticism of news coverage over the Islamic State has been reflecting the conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research work stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would happen next in the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in opposition to Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, authorities reported that Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements otherwise, air strikes against Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group's financial resources, as the group built temporary refineries and sells oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been handed over outside the headquarters.
Commander of Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized the past year after many lawmakers found the Senate's testimony to an over-violence assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and replaced him in Centcom by a gene. Joseph L. Votel.
The US won the field hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today the decisive match will be played in the UK team
Katie Bam scored three goals in the match against Japan, which ended with a 6:1 victory, and just a day after, she scored the first two goals of the game for the U.S. women's field hockey team, in which America beat India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a success worthy of remembering, but Bamova (27) said she was not sure if she had ever done such a thing.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who write down their goals.
But he knows this: the Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to 4:0 matches and share the first place in the group with the UK, which remained undefeated on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will face off on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide which of the group of six teams will finish in the first and who will be second.
The first-place team avoids the strong Danes, who are at the forefront of the second group.
Whatever the end of Saturday's game, the Americans caused a stir here with their surprise ride, four years after finishing among the 12 teams at the London Games.
There was also Bam on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took the hockey stick for the first time in her hand when she was 3 years old (her older sisters of twins played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
The 2008 Olympics escaped her because she didn't make it to the final roster.
Then came the year 2012 when neither she nor her team members did very well.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have a work pace in London as we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bamova started in the first half by scoring a goal with a bekkent from the vicinity.
India entered the match without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score of 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then zigzagged into the middle and scoring the ball into the goal to get the American women into the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who helped to one goal in each of the three victories, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampoline in the middle of Olympic rampage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competition and effort.
It is how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay peg that is passed from the gunman by a swimmer, gymnast and triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the papers, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in a cafe, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecka, or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then he's Logan Dooley, too.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimples on their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be heard in the homes in prime time between advertising and spots of sponsors if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumping.
The Olympic flame doesn't shine for all competitions the same way.
Further from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not universally recognized: shooting from air guns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably reign for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the insights of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first listed at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, the sport remains almost unnoticed - many of whom I have asked not even knew it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a medal in jumping on a trampoline, and until 2012 none of the athletes made it to the final.
Prizes in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be won by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada.
But jumping on the trampoline is still another misfortune, partly because the uninitiated ear will seem more suitable for a clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comical potential - comic vibrations of endless reflectance - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines.
The word "trampolina" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", which means "jump record."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to almost 10 meters and performs sets with several elements (salt, screws and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty and "time in the air".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Gold medal warriors have to go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They are trying to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall, but as the TV news reports, also a different imaginary line: a world or Olympic record.
This unanimous endeavor is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a bit exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on the trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The orbit of an athlete on a trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a state weightless like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulty, but for the duration of the line-up there is no fierce fight to achieve the goal, no distance measuring, but only a perfect, graceful lath of time and gravity.
This is the closest thing when the Olympics and the Zen will come close.
The qualification and final of women takes place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'xted East time, the men's competition then on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block that starts on both days at 14 o'cate.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise peaceful, pleasant moments that you will probably overlook through other fights.
And if attention is to be reached only in such a way that male athletics will be the subject of love perspectives and materialization - as the US gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans, who are gasping for breath.
"Protesting Generation" in Ethiopia, long-time U.S. Ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia have encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
But over the past few months, anti-government unrest has engulfed the country, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses say police officers shot dead and killed hosts of unarmed protesters.
On circulating videos of protests that are likely to come from the end of last year or early this year, members of the security forces are being beaten to beat young people with sticks after being forced to stand on the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It’s always been difficult to keep this country together and take a step forward will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the danger of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has evolved at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia is hard to describe as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without cease speaks of government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But that can change.
"When you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He protests all the youth.
He protests an entire generation.
There are many complaints and they concern everything from disputes over the ground to the absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's election, which was widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now control 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, there is increasing pressure on the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this inaccurately marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
The Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past years, such as the Oromania Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and rearm themselves.
There are several factors explaining why, after years of squising below the surface, these bitter sensations have flared up again.
The first is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks for up to the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly the case during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians have spoken about how they gathered for protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between the Oromas and the Amharyan, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oromas and Amhars are not natural allies.
For many ages, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian hills of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce, and used Oroma, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on the road to a united leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oromis.
The largest protests took place in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many of the Amhars and the Oromis believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up around 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Melese Zenawi.
Zenawi, an insurgent leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unequivation.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly masterfully able to reveal the initial signals of discontent and used the ambassadors to process the opponents and get them on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, an analyst at the conflict.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been pulled from a relative unknown in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigrayan region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the Tig's controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be further shedding of blood.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005 after thousands of people protested what analysts called the election that the government had shacked and then stole.
This was followed by a hard crackdown during which many protesters were killed - albei less than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop.
There is dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amhar city of Gondar attacked business firms owned by the Tigers, and the resentence against the Tigists on social media became increasingly common.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an aunerous situation.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone over neighboring Somalia, although it recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West wants to unequivocally support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to disintegrate in an already volatile area.
"That," Abdi said, "the edge is a very sharp edge."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and funding IS as a 'sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump on Friday attempted to downplay the latest controversy that floods his campaign with a statement that he was not serious about it, insisting several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to speak clearly with the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward situation, who have defended him hard in tumultuous times and must explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
After this proposal at the meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in talks that he really did not intend to say that the president and H. Clinton created IS.
But in a tweet on Twitter on Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The paper was the opposite of an old-timer just one day old, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump remark by reminding Obama was seeking to destroy IS, the Republican candidate did not respond.
The latest storm comes the moment Trump has attempted to focus his campaign's focus on the economy, while his preferences in pre-election polls are falling.
Trump and Clinton took part in a duel in Michigan on economic issues this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, and he said that she said her speech was boring.
Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
At the end of July, when he received a wave of criticism, when he spoke out with a suggestion that the Russians should break into Clinton's emails, to later explain his remark by saying: "I am, of course, sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and moderate them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing, to what extent some reports have a response to his supporters to find out how they react, and then, by reaction, “submitted an explanation in one way,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist that followed the language that the two candidates used.
But I also think he is agile in his statements and knows that they are vain enough to be explained in different ways.
As the results of the pre-election polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more snide tone in recent days, instead of alleviating things for general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, which was released on Friday, showed that Tump is far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very closely behind it in Florida.
Trump attempts to avoid apologies for provocative statements he says, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump facing increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put Trump's unpleasant situation in the uncomfortable situation of his devoted supporter, who must stand behind him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively on Thursday in an interview with CNN.
"I believe that what he is saying is a legitimate political comment," Giuliani said, when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he completely erroneously called a newcomer. And it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, has allowed IS to grow and not be able to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Ahead of Friday's rally in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to blow the fire around him on Twitter for breaking his every word and being biased against him.
He laughed at the “porous, pathetic” TV scholars who are trying to understand him, and said, “They can’t do that!”
Several Democrats snipped Trump's adology saying it was just further evidence that he wasn't eligible for the presidency.
The cafe was pushed out of the market by prices. He is now back in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg, where you could pay only cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps in the shape of a cupcake.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel was plundered and from Verb is now a soap store."
But if there's a change in New York, it's also a rediscovery.
The resurgent Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is also good.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and CEO of the new job.
He started in Verb in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay him a move to a new place, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez, 36, left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bread supplier and bought the same espresso machine model.
He even reused the lighting from the old Verbu.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
There are sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find bowls with brown rice.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but the offer of fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original regulars.
“A lot of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of such customers, Rebecca Oliveira.
Mrs. Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and went to the Verb Cafe often.
She even walked when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verbo," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day she had a mixed chai instead of her usual iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been visiting Verbo since 2003.
He goes to work and always orders the same thing.
"At a quarter and eight o'clock every day, I'll come here, and they're already preparing my bun for me with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what usually, but sometimes he lets bacin, eggs and ham on his bun on his bun.
Rodriguez said he was not sorry that the soap store took his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we could still take advantage of it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also accepted the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it soon so that his new neighbors feel at home here.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juice maker wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the cafe to expand into the neighbouring building.
It is enough for many customers to get back their old favorite.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, it said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe opened again, to enter and have coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office as president in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in an Oval Office and had lunch.
The gourmet president Roosevelt enjoyed selected dishes from 5. avenue, such as goose liver paess and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu for this day, however, was more modest: eggs on the devil's way in the tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of a residential home on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work, "A Square Meal," published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed cooking solidarity and gathered with the reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg store with sandwiches, a small austere buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had a turkey, a mashed porridge and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meat meatball, which, according to the couple, was excellently suited to talk about food during the crisis.
“The meatballs were very popular,” said Miss Ziegelman.
It sold peanut, liver and bean meatballs.
They were made from that admiration and other inexpensive foods that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grimaced.
"They'd lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet of eating what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner served freshly baked cake.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" follows in what ways the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, fearful point for the American people," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same feared was the new budget diet: mysterious foods spread, like meatballs and food from saucers, as a "a wonderful way to use leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as the cooks could hide unaestetic ingredients under the cream sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the focal point of American food - has become an economically allocated luxury.
The strange mixtures, which were intended to serve as a caloric and nutritional filling, took precedence over taste or even common sense in cooking.
During the surveys for the book, which contains recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of roasted onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter with baked onions does not go together.
It was typical for a lot of homemade recipes.
Just like never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the shepherd of the Federal Office for the Domestic Economy from 1923 to 1943 - ran the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over the reins of the budget, and converted spaghetti, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, into tasty dishes.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, desserts arose in the response of the government to its hungry citizens, such as the pose of President Herbert Hoover “I’ll have a pie”.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowe farm kitchen of his childhood, he dine as a chosen millionaire he became.
"He likes to eat continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-row.
President Roosevelt would probably make the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't forced him to set an example of his own stomach.
As the book tells us, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all. This led to the White House “not just served the most permissible food in Washington, but also the most dismalized way prepared.”
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis subsided as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they better understood Miss Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - for example, why couldn't shesth throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, “The people were sick.”
There was an accident with the walls.
When the tables were clean at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ached for lunch.
"It's called a plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give sleek names to modest recipes.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly buried the spoon in thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a proper manager, he said to his wife, "A little chopped-swallowed would shove."
Europeans: Migrants are going for benefits.
Most of the refugees pouring into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what the series would look like if we filmed them.
A group of Russian artists calling themselves 2D Among Us make fun of their native country.
Using a photoshop, he creates collages that humorously show what it would look like if famous shows and films were filmed in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the cost of legal representation in the case of patent against hepatitis C against Merck Group
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of lawyers’ fees that arose in the trial of a patent against hepatitis C against a drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a ruling was overturned, according to which Gilead was to pay $200 million for the damages of Merck's two patents in connection with Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni's highly successful drugs, after a federal judge repeatedly found an illegal act on Merck's side, among other things, a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to waive the fees incurred in the case-by-sponsorship.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the next-generation drug market against hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in drugs from Gilead.
U.S.-backed military units claim to have gained full control of Manbij city
U.S.-backed military forces have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now composing the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals who hid in the city.
Units have liberated over 2 000 civilians that the militants have detained, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij military council told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching,” he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax return stating that the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had revenue of $10.75 million in the year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-president Bill Clinton contributed $5.3 million to the joint cash, and former Secretary of State awarded $3 million in income from Simon & Schuster for his book on his work at the State Department.
Clinton's co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of the state of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, have filed a 10-year tax return.
They paid a real tax of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign, said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit of the U.S. Treasury Department tax department as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaign aide on Twitter, adding to the Democrats' tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special adviser to Trump, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audits were over.
According to Trump's critics, among whom is the Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, business transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is speaking strongly on the issue and on Friday released a video of recalling how high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, the question mentioned in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all other presidential candidates have done for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said in front of people.
Politico reported that Trump has paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 90’s, and the New York Times has quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim this may be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that all those who earn more than $1 million in a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, in Nebraska, where Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, Buffet called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also passed the IRS audit and that Trump is “defean” by the tax office, but the electorate.
Clinton's campaign was released by tax returns retroactively until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York state, paid a federal tax on average 32 percent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons’ tax returns for 2015 show that, unlike most Americans, they are only $100 in their pay income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported income on dividends and interest rates of $109 000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into human dwellings - throwing condoms filled with chilli powder.
This process has proven itself, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this procedure and trains volunteers in the villages in the north of Tanzania to use this non-violent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used to use a spear in their defense.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since they were developed by this... set of tools, we have seen a change in behavior in these communities. People much more believe that elephants can keep outside their fields without hurting them," Honeyguidido Foundation chief executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second step is to shine a flashlight on the passing elephant and lowering the horn.
If it does not deter him, it will be a throw away of the so-called “milithic cloud”.
Chilli powder mixed with salt with the firecracker wraps in a condom, its end is knotted to only the wick.
After launch, the condom explodes and a fine chilli powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually, one breath is enough and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is the firing of fireworks, which evokes a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director leans into Berlin's hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel on the "request" of Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin sparked a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calls to Israel, according to an employee's "requirement" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of a documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah", ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in a list of hotel calls codes.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 Israel was removed and deleted in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Hotel Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility of calling to Israel via its own call center.
The director sought an explanation and turned to the reception of the hotel with the problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmanna said, was "shocking."
The hotel's staff replied that the measure was "decided after consideration for the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this step irritated the director even more.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's call code be erased," Lanzmann quoted the employees as saying in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great embarrassance."
We were horrified and shocked by the events.
It is a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain, is even more shameful.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event provoked a strong reaction online, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel has simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," the statement said, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street, stands near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any allegations by calling the event an "overview" and "apologized" to Lanzman.
“Never has been a direct order” to include Israel in the list of codes for calls, Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
He adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The clash of students and police occurred in San Paul, Brazil, on Thursday, when students gathered at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement tried to disperse students, which ended up being used by the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of San Paul Governor Gerald Alckmin in the goal of saving money is also the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300 000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could be seen spray-paining signs against interim President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes just days after the demonstrators took to the streets en masse in support of the deposed president, Dilma Rousseff, when the country's senate decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran rises 71% - RT Business
According to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagarian, the trade turnover increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian firms that are trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran grew by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent, reaching $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jump in the trade ensured the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued around 35 000 visas to the citizens of Iran, mainly travel.
In addition, Iran first made it among the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It can be safely said that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be surpassed,” he said.
At the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes there will be a change.
"Personally, I can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Wheeled Skinner cattle rush home after Britons win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night when the VB team's trio defended the title from London 2012.
The twenty-three-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of a brake that Sir Chris Hoy took for his Scots, and the young man pleased the legend as he rushed to the finish and stole the victory from the hands of the favored New Zealand.
Britain surprisingly won four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the end of the modest sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in March, although Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for the specialized introductory racer Jamie Staff.
Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoye's departure, the place he also made available, which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton also made.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with Hoy champion four years ago - and with Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but took the jersey in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly backwards after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in strategy was a large part of the transformation, where Hindes drove on a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes climbed the podium, he did not take their eyes off them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set the Olympic record in the final and we beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win it.
After a 2012 triumph alongside Kenny and Hoye in London, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later pulled back the remark and Britain's rivals had no choice but to appeal.
This time there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London with all the British flags on the bleachers."
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for the nation that won seven of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then a successful five days await us at the velodrome.
With the form that Kenny showed, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
It would then mean a total of six golds for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, for Kenny - which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, it also means a total of six gold medals for Kenny - and a total of six gold medals.
Anyway, how much Hoy gained.
As the next, Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and will last another three days.
The twenty-eight-year-old Bolton native said, “Now I’m enjoying this one.
A team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for myself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
That was the only medal race that day, but Britain was still waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull have qualified as the fastest four-kilometre squad for the four-kilometre squad.
They ended with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (22:42) take place on the second day of the race, which will certainly be targeted by the Wiggins.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when the referees called on him to measure the height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie achieved a world record with a time of 4:3.260.
The VB team relied on its strong track cycling team and dominated the middle season of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After the truly exceptional performances proving the utter superiority in Beijing and London, it has decreased during the preparations for Rio expectations.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least, the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the velodrome races illustrates, it seems that the legendary reputation of the UK team being able to deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of Portland melting after termination of power supply contract
The future of Portland's aluminum melting plant in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies the enterprise with electricity and which has informed the intention of one of the owners of the melting contract to terminate the electricity supply contract. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
This step is taking place after the Victoria government earlier this year decided not to extend the provision of subsidies that keep the business running.
The validity of a solid twenty-year subsidy expires in November.
At Alcoa Portland, up to 2000 jobs could be at risk.
When closed, up to 2000 jobs can be at risk - direct or indirect.
And because the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be additional avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry ejector in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
Alcoa's tavern in Portland is a lose-bearing and threatens to close.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the business, originally in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices of the plant production.
AGL, which supplies large aluminium ejection from the Loy Yang A plant in the Latrobe Valley, said she expected any of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumin, small business shares are held by the Chinese company CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the apparent demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue,” she said.
AGL said the treaties were so-called "providing treaties" that were due to come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so their validity will actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the 2017 fiscal year,” the plant said.
Any potential impact on AGL profits since fiscal 2018 is now limited due to the strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written the value of contracts according to its books of $187 million "in case of termination."
Alcoa said that the contract decision to terminate "doesn't have an impact on its ... ability to operate a tarpaulin or secure the supply of electricity to the tarpaulin."
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into effect from November this year, although it still needs to explain why it has backed down from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and Tomago race near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts per year.
If both companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in market demand [electronic energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the real estate TV show Kardashians - now the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of a clan's mother-manoager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover of the September issue of Vogue magazine.
Kendall, an ambassador for the Estee Lauder brand, who performed at fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry at this front page," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply sequel humoresque performed by the Kardashians?) staged video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (Barin rioters Rob and Caitly and with them all the popular uncle from show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). They forgot about the cover of their sisters just so that the scene could end in a classic turn: they are preparing a secret party.
It's an adorned storyline of almost every "biphinchobial" episode of a children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we'd forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure that other girls could feed on this publicity.
Because when we look at Vogue magazine's September issue, we've definitely entered the new era of the Kardashian.
Kim's older sister may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (it was on her with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the magazine's September issue is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The edition, which by its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that from 832 pages in last year's edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The unveiling of the star, which appears on the cover, is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the magazine's films have escaped before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evdelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has certainly been more “celebrities that make models” than “models who are celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar winner and Dior ambassador, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But while it is very unlikely that Kendall - whom the magazine describes as a "breakthrough model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people, nor to the stars of real estate shows, or children of today who know how to make a well-dired video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadida in June, calling them "the girls of the moment."
These feelings flared up again with the news that Jenner would appear on the Vogue cover.
But this dissatisfaction is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue in September.
She's a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
He's showing off for Mark Jacobs.
It sells you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she performs in a reality show, perhaps only as one way to see Kourtney and her children.
Community Legal Aid Centres Reject 160 000 People Every Year
More than 160 000 most vulnerable citizens are rejected every year in community centres of legal aid and are preparing for the effects of further restrictions on funds for already overly used services in the sector itself.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly advanced-aged people, immigrants, endangering workers, victims of violence, and people without funds to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already refusing when they seek free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to burst, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The director of the community centers of legal aid in Queenslas, James Farrell, said that according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers, five thousand people were found to be rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without the abolition of the decision of the federal government, the situation would deteriorate.
"Community legal aid centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who escaped from relationships with the rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families passing through separation, workers who are unfairly laid off - all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leading to thousands of other endangered people from Queensland will have to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We call on Queensland's public prosecutor and Senator George Brandis to immediately prevent this shortening of funding, to get the help they need when they get into legal issues.
In the past year, the government of the state has fulfilled its commitment to securing the financing of legal aid up to the full average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community centres of legal aid and their clients' communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after a member of staff allegedly pointed a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been filed a lawsuit for alleged inaction after they were told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February aimed a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep.
The incident was described in a court file that was handed over by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign-to-source software trainer in the state, on Wednesday at a state court in a lawsuit.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he came to the conclusion that "it would not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "keeted his fingers of a gun, put a real index finger on the trigger and pointed the barrel on Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file states that after a complaint with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
“Weapons don’t have to fire to cause damage,” Bordini said in a lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee sparked a stir when he told voters in North Carolina that owners and gun owners (registered in the U.S. in the Second Amendment to the Constitution) could intervene if his opponent Hillary Clinton is elected and will be able to appoint her judges.
The Trump campaign says that the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate for the violence.
In the lawsuit, the Bordini is seeking compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for endangering personal security, unlawful use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the report for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news outlet in Charlotte, announced that Phillip recently left the campaign.
No one responded to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services in a short period of time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is leading a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is vastly appealing, just like London 2012 was, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions are able to benefit from the Olympics.
The Olympic Games marked huge benefits for both Startford and East End.
And we do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses close to Heathrow.
Only for our local communities, we will create 10 000 new teaching venues, 40 000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would ridicule ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out that they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and businesses, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team on the Heathrow that, on time and with a budget, introduced an 11-billion-pound infrastructure investment program, starting with the T5 terminal - which was voted the best terminal in the world for five years in a row, after Terminal T2 built between the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third runway, which is worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge success for the UK, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be it, too.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand the Heathrow, secure trading for the future, leaving the legacy of skills and employment that Britain may be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Treasury Department of Business Affairs.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in cat and mouse game in ad blocking
Experiments on how to bypass advertising-blocking programs have become a cat and mouse game for companies that make money from online marketing. At least that's what one of the companies that programs such software says.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted on its site a post stating that users can update the filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the page are advertising.
Adblock, however, now claims that the new codes have already been circumvented.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open source ad community and those trying to circumvent them has been going on since the blocking of ads was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another fix.
The fact that a company owning the world's largest social network has been involved in the war only proves how much the blocking of advertising has become for the industry.
According to the study, this was carried out by Pagefair last year, and Adobe uses ads worldwide by about 200 million people - almost four times as many as it did in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook ads, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The spokesman said the company is against advertising filters on desktops because mobile filters for mobile apps for the social network and Instagram do not work.
Desktop ads still represent a profit high enough for Facebook to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it would update the "ad preferences" setup tool to give people the opportunity to better control how ads appear to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters are concerned because they could also block content on the site that is unrelated to the ad.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Advertising blocking is an insensitive tool, so we’ve focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by car Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to the incident in which a woman was run over on Thursday morning on the highway, who probably attempted suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actor of the "desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but according to the police, not all have been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and all those who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said to Le Tribune de Geneve attorney Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
The prosecutor must find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases from the past five years, drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases - one of whom was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of charges of negligent homicide after shejourn on a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court said the victim was drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and fainting on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was travelling in a reasonable manner and that the presence of the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident that occurred at Morges should log in to the police on the phone number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20 thousand visitors to come to Prague Pride in Prague.
On Friday, the Executive Director of AČCKA, Kateřina Petříčková, said this.
The sixth year of Prague Pride started on August 8, the festival brings the life of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) closer.
Last year, about 35 thousand people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses," Petříčková said.
According to the organizers’ survey, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of CZK 3100 per person per person.
Gay tourists are available to special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clients are very lucrative, interested in stays in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is also held as part of the festival program this year.
Experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China lecture.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also be devoted to several thematic areas, which are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival on Saturday will be a traditional procession with allegorical cars, which will come from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
The paratroue, attended by thousands of people in recent years, this year will honor a minute's silence in memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat are celebrating forty years.
Indecisorable DIYers Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained both small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series directed by Lubomír Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, were the cartoons of the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who invented for a magazine with two DIY, Mr. Ouholík and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the dramaturge Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimír Jiránek to cooperate and together they created the film Kut'áci.
Today's appearance with a yellow and red trick and a beanie and a radio came the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak Television began to be created in the Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given DIY in 1985, this time it was made directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other parts were made.
After his death in 1995, other parts with other creators continued, many of them Beneš’s son Marek participated.
At present, there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these DIYers, who pour everything under their hands, but they never get angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, which will be illustrated by the well-known gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and characters, and other toys with the depiction of Pat and Mat are the hit of every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sporting and one of the lives.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved a historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what kind of things do people spend the most at airports?
This is Friday's overview from the world's websites.
The first medal from the Olympics.
The island nation of Fiji is celebrating its historic success.
The rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the UK team in the final of the Olympic tournament of the seven-grandigh rugba.
It is the first ever medal that Fiji won for itself at the Olympics.
The wait for the first precious metal took sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympic Games was sent.
Coach Fiji is a great credit for success.
Ironically, he is the Briton Ben Ryan.
He has been leading the team since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen, he could be satisfied unlike his compatriots.
"Let's play freely and lightly and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually dominated it, and a small state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The report was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without hands and feet from 11 months has been given a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old girl rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her doll's hands and feet, and then she sits together without prosteses.
Harmony was diagnosed in less than a year of life with meningitis type B, doctors gave it only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He also has a perspective.
I saw her introduce herself to other children with the words Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands, my mother added.
See what joy the doll has elicited.
What do we spend the most on the airport?
CNN provides a finding that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
The Hudson's travel essential store chain has published data for the past year, where it summarizes the 10 products that customers most often buy at its stores at airports.
The water was the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, eight of them placed in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large package of M&M candies with coconut flavor.
Can you guess who closes the top ten?
The only thing you can’t eat.
According to CNN, it is the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
Rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have been versidium reigning the category of twos without a helmsman for seven years and confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the incope of the duo turned into a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing competition since 2009.
On the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, they scored their 69th win in a row in Thursday's final.
What are we different from the others?
We're just nicer, Murray joked already during the Olympic regatta when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand duo.
Frankly, we don't do anything different from the others.
We're just practicing hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their domination is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-metre-long and hundred-kilo chasm, the academic-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond is studying and doing his finances, Murray has had a charity boxing match.
Because of this, they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric gets into the boat basically with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what can go wrong, Bond admitted, who even at a press conference demonstrated that Murray is dominant in the crew.
He was always the first one to answer, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, they destroy the opponent with calm force.
They go their pace, and although often in the middle of the track they are not in the lead, their gradual acceleration has not yet found the recipe.
We race on a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to go the first kilometer stop.
We're just trying to go a pace that no one else can do.
We know what we need to do to win, said thirty-four-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both members of the gold four were without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to switch to two without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, they apparently made up for the biggest defeat of their careers and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us and asked nothing.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well, Murray said.
We know that everyone wants to throw us off the throne.
We still have the target on our backs.
But we try to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of the new NASA climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for the Study of Space have developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate-based scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, water-free and saturated CO2, conditions could have been similar to conditions on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low vetting rate of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, Venus once seemed to be proud of a thin atmosphere similar to the Earth, while turning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet, the areas were probably drier than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to rule it and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the Sun, which was 30 percent more muted.
“In a simulation of the GISS Venus during slow rotation, he exposes his day side to the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a new report.
This leads to the heating of the surface and the formation of rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds, which behave like an umbrella and shield the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures, which are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus similar to evolution, which was previously hypotherically assembled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus has probably been habitable in the past -- over the past billions of years -- has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated, and water vapors were burned by ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped and only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of the greenhouse gas was left -- it's Venus as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday for the Colorado Avalanche team, citing the inability to participate in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado Vice President/General Joe Sakic confirmed the move, stating that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
“I’ve been head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the last three years for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
I have been thinking for a long and intense time over the summer how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey operations are in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that impact the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sackic, who received Roye on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team's benefits.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Saic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to a gain of 112 points and first place in the Central Division. But Colorado struggled with Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and over the past two years, it has always missed games after the season.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015/2016 season, missing five points to get a second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on North Sea oil rig reopen talks and interrupt strike
Top officials of the negotiating parties said the strikes over wages for the workers of the oil rig in the North Sea are interrupted, while all sides of the dispute came together for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil services company sporadically occurred on the platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process for resolving the current disagreement," the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a number of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is in protest against wage cuts by up to 30 percent.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid off about 9 percent less to its North Sea suppliers due to negative market pressure.
The cut in corporate rates comes after a 10 percent cut for coastal companies in 2014.
The company says further cuts would give the company a room to cope with the market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell has cut thousands of people out of its payrolls and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to upgrade its processes - immediately after a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work-life disparities for the entire generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the economy in the region.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some,” he said in a statement.
By comparison, in 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years is around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiadians
The latest mission of Kepler's space telescope to help astronomers is to get a near-full list of the speed of turning stars from the Pleiade star cluster.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster revolve around at different speeds, as is how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star matter, its age and even history in its solar system,” Luisa Rebulla, a research worker at the Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the Pasadena, said in a new report.
The star cluster of Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many cluster stars are now reaching an adult state and have been formed for about 125 million years.
Now he's turning fast.
In the instantaneous speeds of rotation, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar winds.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotation speed slows down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotation speeds, larger stars rotate more slowly than the less massive stars.
Rebulová compares the stars to the dancers, the larger ones make pirouettes more slowly than the smaller ones.
“In the ‘balette’ of Pleiades, we see that slower-drifting stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars,” she said.
Because the Pleiadian cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of stars and the speed of rotation.
"The plieds provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in both younger and older stars," Rebullova said.
There's still a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their rotation speed and so say "hanging their dancing shoes on a clover."
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualification Agreement Necessary?
If I did not apply, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work without registering in special education after graduation?
My point is that in the field where I would like to work, there is now a vacancy only in a somewhat more distant hospital, but in about six months it could be freed up space in another, where I would then like to work.
So I don’t know how to deal with the situation about half a year, the question continues.
It Responds Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - a hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institute regulated by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the return on the costs incurred in increasing or deepening the employee's qualifications.
In the field of health, there is a long-term pressure to not conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare professionals, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to the Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognizing professional competence and specialized competence for the exercise of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, expressly, participation in specialized education is considered to be the deepening of qualifications (not for increasing it).
This means that the qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs amount to at least CZK 75 000.
No legal regulation nor does it impose an obligation to apply for specialization education.
The law only lays down the conditions for applications for inclusion in the field of specialized education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to exercise the profession of a doctor already thanks to the necessary university studies, albeil under the statutory conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation where professional experience completed in another field of specialization can be included in the specialized education of a doctor, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
In theory, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the questioner’s situation.
However, due to the fact that I do not know the more detailed circumstances of this case, it is recommended to consult with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (State of Science and Medical Professions), as the Ministry of Health provides a counselling and consulting service related to the inclusion in specialization education and its course.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from Halab, Syria, are asking for U.S. intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (the rebellious part of the city by government troops) and did not use its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, AFP quoted from a letter addressed to the White House.
"We don't need tears, compassion, and even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab is not encirculated again," the doctors said.
Russian forces that support the military loyal to President Bashar al-Assada have announced that from today they will stop strikes in the Halab region every day for three hours to allow the humanitarian convoys to safely pass.
From 9:00 to 12:00 CELČ, all military activities, airstrikes and artillery fire are to be stopped.
U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed this, but stressed the need for at least a two-day ceasefire.
According to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who work in the eastern part of Halab are controlled by rebels have appealed to Obama in the letter.
They write that during the five-year war they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world watches and states how complex Syria is, but it does little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound only slightly blurred threats, pointed out by pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors said in the past month there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, 15 of them from hospitals in which they work.
We are most saddened that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Young children come to the emergency room with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, doctors have described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the explosion interrupted the supply of oxygen to their incubators.
They were gasping for breath, and then their lives ended - before they could actually begin, they recalled.
The army loyal to President Bashar al-Assada, which is supported by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebel-controlled eastern part of Halab in recent weeks, with more than 200,000 people living inside.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes by the Russian and Syrian air force, managed to break the encirclement on Saturday after three weeks and launch a counteroffensive.
Both sides then added reinforcements in the city and its surroundings.
