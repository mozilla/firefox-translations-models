In an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend
During a call to the emergency hotline, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to police that he had shot his girlfriend and it is necessary for them to come to their home.
Lamb had decided that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably upset, and that contacts to the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten report on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter, which Lamb signed, said.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to a school campus where police believe he shot favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard shootings at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb is said to have made a fateful phone call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting, it forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, the authorized authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details, published by investigators on the part of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, together created an image of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote in his thanks to the "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both were taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students went to classes at both at once.
There have also been inclinations when it comes to problems.
The student, who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb has previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons, when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the university's recruitment of staff meant that a doctorate that Lamb worked hard on would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become a professor's assistant.
University President William LaForge said he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb was apparently troubled by something."
Lamb won't answer those questions again.
After he drove off the campus, police caught his trail as he crossed the border of the state of Arkansas back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single shot from a pistol in the yard of the house about a mile from his parents in a suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington state's coroner, Methel Johnson, confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3500 students in a city of about 12000 residents, in 2009 and taught geography and education lessons.
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a clever, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older boy who had been tutoring her playing guitar for several years.
It was quite a heartbreaker back then.
The heart of all the girls has started as soon as it has appeared," claims Hairston, who is now 40 and living in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for a while.
During an emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they had broken up 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely collapsed," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was a best friend with her mother.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at the summer festival three years ago.
They later played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a spore-lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, a sweat that Lamb finished on guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"He was just a happy couple," he said.
We were naseling and recording each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a slain professor, led a first-year seminar and specialized in indigenous American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and student government.
At the Cleveland Delta State campus on Tuesday night, about 900 people including faculty members, staff, students and community members attended a commemorative event with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also took part in a vigil during which the college choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
School started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge argues.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
The writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story was edited to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a phone call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says they won't hire as many seasonal workers as they did last year, but the manufacturer of children's toys and products says it will give current employees and seasonal workers the chance to work more hours.
The company also said it planned to hire about 40 000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, a drop from 45 000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and will recruit employees during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help in stores and sell, for shipping and delivering goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to come when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The film begins and I realize that I'm within reach of something that might be called a fake date with a Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "The Return to the Future," which features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: "It's really, indisputably, the best travel documentary ever made for me."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Ban Ki-moon, secretary general, says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
Once again, the UN chief has urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a Wednesday press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial session of the General Assembly at the end of this month for discussing the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers had "made this situation insoluble."
Ban called on five permanent members to show solidarity and unity, which they showed in reaching an Iranian nuclear deal in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 polling numbers that show Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to label him as a person who often changed his mind.
The others waved their hands like a failed joke.
And some are getting ready for an implosion.
But whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they're not succeeding (yet).
10 of the last 11 national polls show that Donald Trump is in the lead by a double digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what this means for this tycoon's nomination chances from the real estate industry.
Of course, it is still the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, Rick Perry's leadership made the path to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could come across in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and are beginning to lay out their dollars to stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent vote numbers that suggest that a real estate tycoon is not just an ephemeral phase:
Trump's assessment of favorability turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University vote showed that only two in 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was already 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And those numbers are held in the early stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll that took place last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two in 10 said they would be "outraged" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "excited" against the 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the company's favorite, Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompousness and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationally inclined to the idea that the real estate man has the right temperament for the post president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post vote.
The same number is held in the Iowa state senatorial club, which is the first in the entire country where 52 percent of Republicans think they have a commander's personality, according to Quinnipic last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When he puts on his scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who will most likely win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to last week's CNN/ORC poll.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn't have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
By this time in the previous cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Still, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have gathered around a different nominee, Trump is defeating nearly everyone anyway.
Some scholars emphasize that a fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical straight-forward fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always get majority support.
He leads by 13 points over Carly Fiorina, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a businessman with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical match of one against one.
Donald Trump's bare majority of supporters say they have already made their minds up.
A new CBS/NYT poll shows that just more than half of Trump-backed voters say they won't change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep their backdoor open for a change among the candidates.
Still, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "raisers" in a notification speech of his campaign, immigration is still holding up as the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear Trump's pomp will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage the effort to rebrand.
But according to a new Monday ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
The frustration of the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are receiving roughly half of the support from Republican voters today, primarily given their state of outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post vote say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry with Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "disgruntled" and 21 percent "hell-angry."
The House supported a larger share of the state from coal charges.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies in its first reading supported the government amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the proceeds of fees from surface brown coal mining from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that this would give the extra money to both the treasury and municipal budgets.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining firms will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have been, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in the first reading supported the government amendment to the Mining Act, which, among other things, means that the state should receive a larger part of the proceeds of fees from surface brown coal mining from mining companies.
The state's share will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent so far.
The draft also changes the way the payment for minerals is calculated, which companies extract.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring 427 million crowns more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of municipal budgets is supposed to have a neutral impact, because the fee is supposed to be higher.
Last year, municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget received 150 million crowns.
About 200 million crowns and the state went to the municipalities from brown coal mining.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the payment from the mining areas with the permitted mining to 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these reimbursements should continue to belong to municipalities in full.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that municipalities would receive between 14 million and 100 million crowns per year instead of 14 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but it will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The reimbursement is newly calculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the setting of the fee by a government order may not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining are charged.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter will be given to the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of radioactive rock mining.
A portion of the money that the state collects on mining fees will be purpose-bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide the mining emergency service.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would harm municipalities affected by mining and regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have been, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.
The KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned against the rise in unemployment in the Most region.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed rejecting the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining firms, the fee increase will not translate into coal prices because prices are more than 90 percent long-term contracted.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
However, she said the increase in employment fees is tolerable.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment by Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government’s decision on the limits of coal mining before the law is passed.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on yields for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek in that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak army should fall only after 2020.
According to him, the limits on the CSA mine should be broken already for reasons of social, national economic and because of the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Veselý will lead the Czechs as the number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board during Thursday's Davis Cup draw in India, and this time each of them will probably intervene in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans to spread the load over the entire quartet due to the difficult conditions.
There is a heat and high humidity in Delhi, so challenging matches are expected, which can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out according to the weather.
And according to what it will look like, Navratil said during today's training of the Czech selection in the center of Raj Kumár Khánna.
With the team's number one and world forty-year-old Jiří Veselý, he is counting on Friday and Sunday's doubles.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are likely to take the position of the number two.
I would like almost everyone to get involved.
I'm slowly in my head, but I won't say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Štěpánek's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It's just a question of who will stand next to an experienced doubles player who has a 18:4 record in the Davis Cup in doubles.
It probably won't be cheerful.
There are options left with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
"I really don't know who and what it's going to look like," Navratil said.
It will be decided according to the development of the doubles.
The option may be Pavlásek, with Veselý surprised in the 1st round by winning the doubles over the Australians.
"He's decent for the deblo," Navratil said.
Against Australia I succeeded, and if I play, I would like to show the same performance that I have shown there since the second set.
"I'm happy for that experience and I'd like to bring a point," Pavlásek said.
The home side will put Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), which was won last week by a challenger in Shanghai, where he beat a player of the third and fourth hundred rankings.
The number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164th).
Both are challenger players and ours have experience from the ATP Tour, but we've already convinced ourselves many times that the rankings in the Davis Cup don't decide.
"The current form, the weather, decides," Navratil said.
Friday's opening doubles will begin at 6:30 CEST and can stretch because of the weather.
According to the forecast, it is supposed to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, it can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already scorched it, and it's got some two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," Navratil said.
Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at the PMQ is very enthusiastically expected
New Chief Executive Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and will work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and MPs.
In a week-long statement, he demanded "less theatre and more facts."
He also said he could skip several sessions he would leave to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC's annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand still during the singing of the national anthem on the service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the centre of attention to several stories on the front pages of newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he would "stand" in respectful silence" and that he would recognize "the royal air force's heroism in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would advise Labour leader to sing the national anthem "in respect" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, quoting differences in economics, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences in work are also "storing" after Mr. Corbyn's appointment through his position in the European Union and the government's benefit limit.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the benefit limit.
Hours later, Mr Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party had "very clearly" opposed government plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party faced by David Cameron in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the workers' party, who has promised a different approach to politics, argues that he has ideas "out of the crowd" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQs are too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "prompt answers" and gear trade, and instead promise to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn argues that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will represent him at the PMQ if he doesn't attend - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also abandoned the idea of letting other colleagues speak for him from time to time, because he was told that he had discussed the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the style of "Punch and Judy" politics, which was often associated with PMQ, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House and their position among other MPs, despite critics arguing that they have become a cartoon and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Photo shoot in Joburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homelessness.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn something and earn a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighborhood and earn money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

The pound is rising while the rise in salaries in the UK is accelerating
The pound jumped in the following data and showed the recovery of Britain's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher using the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, GB gains including bonuses rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest since 2009 and it looked like estimates were approaching when rates would pick up.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after getting the offer approach from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and a closer to brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said they had risen by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt-reduction strategy.
Shares in the packing and paper group Mondi were the biggest slump on the index and fell 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs downgraded his credit rating to the firm to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after a sports firm announced an 83% jump in mid-year in pre-tax profits of £46.6m
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports' executive chairman, Peter Cowgill, says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his firm, he states.
The cost could hit plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building marshmallow cheer.
The controversial building got a stop sign.
The investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
The building, which is to be built in close proximity to the Agnes Monastery in the center of Prague, was protested in front of the Prague 1 office by hundreds of people, and a petition was created.
In the decision, the magistrate stated that there was a violation of the Building Act because not all the requirements of the zoning decision were complied with.
"The territorial decision does not contain some of the essentials, for example, the type of land, the distance from the neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and intelligibly described shape of the building, the delimitation of the territory affected by the influence of the building," his decision reads.
It is also considered illegal by the municipality that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the originally discussed documentation, which has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the land of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the file that the owner of the land only gave consent to the project documentation for the zoning procedure, not the consent to the placement of the building on his land, writes the Department of the Building Code.
According to Francesco Augusto Razett of the investor firm, the Department of the Building Code did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review has already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, complying with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmallow because of the supposedly proposed color of the facade, provokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre in protest against the construction in the past.
The association and residents of nearby houses are annoyed that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the unsuitability of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Agnes Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original design of the project from 2008, which envisaged a glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NPÚ) and revoked the permission of Prague conservationists in 2010.
The new project of the company Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows, however, was approved by the National Heritage Office and municipal conservationists and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the criticisms of the opponents, saying he never counted on a facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname after pink-and-white confectionery.
The Czech politician gave a ride to the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees in the car, which they said they wanted to carry about half a kilometre.
At the time, he said, it was not criminal in Hungary, he told Lidové noviny.
We knew that the law enforcement officers did not suffer from such conduct.
But when the officers stopped us, to our surprise, we were arrested and transferred to pre-trial detention in Szeged, he described the paper.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours in the cell.
The police were said to have behaved correctly, but the communication was difficult because they did not speak English very well.
The prison, however, was sad.
For example, in our cell measuring about three by four meters, 15 refugees from Syria crowded.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there the next day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them next, Berg said.
What can't he confiscate anymore?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9. will answer the readers' questions from 9:30 a.m., the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic Mgr. Pavla Fučíková.
You can ask her about the changes to the Enforcement Act in force from September 1, 2015 and other things related to executions or bailiffs.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the Aldi onslaught in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand using marketing in mainstream and social media and events like the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are joining brands such as Dunsborough-based Ice Cream Maker Simmo's offering tastings in IGA stores, and store owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware retailers celebrate their annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake because southern and western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA trade moves and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notorious, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared with around 14 percent in eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will market 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores, which have taken over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, in his report, Morgan Stanley analyst, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail could lose US$360 million on annual sales and Metcash 250 million USD at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the next year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and 600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in Metcash's fixed price base could cost it around US$13 million on pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although the latest survey by Roy Morgan found that shoppers in the IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the fund's senior manager, Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan financial group, said business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear within a decade."
Metcash declined to publicly respond to Douglass' comment.
But it's known that a Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of the IGA has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and earnings from the Metcash food business, which supplies about 1200 retail IGAs , have fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operating evolution of the change in speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesalers have gone on the counter-attack and are investing more than US$150 million a year to match the counter prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores with the addition of fast-growing food and novelties from private individuals.
Metcash's chief executive, Ian Morrice, argues that price-corporation and retrofitting trade programs will catch the slope and hope that the wholesale will return back to basic profitable profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a collateral loss in a recent fuss around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behaviour rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention to himself thanks to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then declared: "Wawrinka should have stretched one to Kyrgios and I should have stretched him too."
While he was last seen smashing a racket after a cramp thwarted Richard Gasquet's possible climb to the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for a second-round finish behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I was thinking quite intensely that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little drawn into the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his racket when he lost because of a cramp in the U.S., but he's not the first player to take out his own anger on his racket because of frustration. I know Thanasi well enough, and I can say he won't be proud of this event.
But he was in serious control very well because he was subjected to very provocative circumstances in the U.S. because of Harrison and so on, so he deserves great credit in my opinion.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he was treated somewhat hard.
He is a very adult 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he fits into the team great and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in amazing shape, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I simply think that he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios because of an important match that begins on Friday, stating that "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but he is backing the Canberry native to return to the team as a long-term star.
“First of all, we want our team to be perfectly focused on the game and not on all the controversy that [Kyrgios] has created around him,” says Healy.
And I think Nick has risen very fast as Federer, Murray and other people point out, he's growing rapidly in the eyes of the public, he's also made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight when he's going to be able to think about it, is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday closed its southern border with Serbia and detained those who attempted to illegally cross it to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in no one's country, and Serbian authorities reacted outraged.
Those who are stuck on the ground between the two states on the belts of the country stand those who flee violence in their native countries, build tents and settle in.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants together call "Open the border!" and scold the Hungarian police's riot squad.
Some in protest refuse food and water.
The Serbian foreign minister declares that it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just indirect harm.
Over the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the bloc's 28 states did not come up with a unified immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share the responsibility of 40 000 people seeking protection in surprise Italy and Greece and spoke with hope of reaching an eventual agreement for another month or the end of the year, which would be accepted by EU nations more than 120 000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU European summit on Tuesday for another week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not hold its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up court cases of asylum hearings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country as the fence on the Serbian border is now complete.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalize the violation of the 4-meter fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also establish longer periods in prison for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are quite clear on this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which was expected in the coming week, but Associated Press reporters on the border have observed heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's adviser for domestic defense, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border and caught 15 already on the state's territory.
They have penetrated through fence damage and are now in police custody accused of committing offences under new laws.
Authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a barbed-wire tow truck.
At the main border crossing near Roszke, chaos arose because Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and crowded people.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders was cut by half in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for a national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her lead.
Clinton is now backed by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (a drop from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will want to become president, is gaining support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly a decision that will support the candidate.
But Clinton sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has won several.
Clinton maintains a big lead among women and mitigates, but her leadership narrows.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only losing 5 points to her.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, and now they are equal to Sanders.
Clinton, however, still has a large lead thanks to senior voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is only losing 5 points to her in that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the state say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would only support her for being a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
It's probably no surprise that Clinton's current adherents are particularly passionate about her.
The views are mixed among those that do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), following that it's time for a woman (13 percent) to be president, and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, a great possibility of choice and agreement on problems is cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like a forehead to do so - a third in turn think he shouldn't run.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would pick as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half listed Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democrats' nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely to be electable is increasing.
However, when it came to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, Democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance of being elected.
Similar to last month, neither Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have good results in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads in honesty out of all three, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that view on him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are consistent with their ideological view.
As for all these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
How questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and the server as secretary of state continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying that this has not affected their overall view of her at all.
But overall, it's a different story among the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the subject was already divided in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that this email controversy has no bearing on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent have worsened their opinion of Clinton.
It's mainly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party's constituents, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: just 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think it's honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush performed best in the honesty.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters have made no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in the national election
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the others are letting themselves seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by overwhelming majority, and have climbed from 23% support in the latest CBS poll conducted ahead of the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found Carson doing well across demographic groups, and is decommissioning Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorin and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is behind, along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, completely on the store from 10% support dropped to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson improved, reaching 19% support among Republicans behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from the ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In a rising trend, Carson decided to shoot blindly at a retired neurosurgeon, and even apologized to Carson for questioning about Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump declared last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the fraternity accused of the death of a first-year student, Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died during an overloading fraternal ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, she was charged with murder against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and delayed to take him to hospital, contributing to his death, police announced.
Police say he was blindfolded, wearing a 30-pound backpack full of sand and repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach his target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Dog Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and allegedly waited an hour for him to be taken to hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood's national president, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide equipment and basically preferred the well-being of fraternity to the life of Michael Deng," Chief Wagner said in a statement.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by a blunt object in the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of overloading in fraternities and at least one student dies every year because of overload since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, wrote in a statement.
Fraternity and their members must be accountable and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
A large Monroe County jury has recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault by overloading and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to detain not only the people involved, but in the event that there is an organization that has approved it, either officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable too," Wagner said at Tuesday's news conference.
Baruch College has banned fraternity and the national fraternity has dissolved its relationship with local branches.
This with tents when the Fed raises interest rates
Rate growth will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy, specifically, the history of the small originator offers about timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in rate hikes is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will respond.
That's why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rate hikes begin, but rather the trajectory of how long normalization will last.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" Julian Jessop, a senior global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more common but still low, will create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen in about a month, the expected rate hikes may make the air a little unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There appears to be a trend for a re-cession of stocks after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years often heads to a rate hike in a fairly flat 250-day (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns again to normal after 500 days, with an average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rate hikes and the return is beginning to decline.
A recession is a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help it.
Currently, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not existed before and that could hasten the recession.
Most notable is that gross domestic product near its lowest point in history when the Fed's rates rise.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, GDP's nominal rise was below 4.5 percent twice.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expected to keep it, when it was at just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and there could be a question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready for the Fed's growth all year, and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the increase cycles so far have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery since the worst of the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those that the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still going on.
The firm return was also volatile because the market expects a rate hike and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more quickly evident in bonds than with stocks when the Fed changes the direction of policy.
For bonds, yields appear to be changing direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increases, bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that raising rates will cause yields to approach the long- and short-dated bonds, which will match the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although "we are still cautious about streaking the yield," Kathy Jones, a fixed-retirement analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already tailored to the expectations of the Fed's policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, the credit spreads have expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that conduct most of their business in the U.S. will win interest rates after the increase and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will do worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be larger.
"History shows that the "quality" of stocks tends to outperform over the course of three months after the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a report for clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets overtook weak balance sheet companies in each interest rate hike in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as low volatility stocks, have also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of purely stock games, consumers also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savingsmen can see their profits also through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will last.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, according to MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the station for "having"
He is of the opinion that he is becoming more and more indistinguishable from his commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says he's simply cheating Brits
MP colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says neither is he an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" in Classic FM, according to a leading MP and accumulating fresh pressure on broadcasts to prove they are doing something that commercial broadcasting is not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's chief executives that the public service radio station appears to be "obunded" and increasingly indistinguishable from its trading rival.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "stubborn" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year appear to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind when you're actually just imitating what we already have in the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general denied the allegations, on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business rival in terms of live music and public education.
I wouldn't learn what I learned about classical music on Radio 3 on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and making music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it was now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before, because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire due to stepping on the heels of business competitors during the broadcasts of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as judges - were made "in a manner typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from their own stable" the next time it launches a fun series.
However, he declined to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending royalty taxpayers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since the records themselves began in 2000
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could be the reason for the braking of spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, and thanks to it, many of Britain's main streets have become ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of steadying online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the very beginning of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of just 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of steadying online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the level of growth in the past years and go back to the year 2000, the situation has always been rationalized over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG revenue index.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to be disappearing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe customers could refrain from shopping ahead of this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average of shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases, dropping several vendors' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers again bargain, can withhold customers from further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims buried victims of crane crash in Mecca and Bin Laden family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims during the execution of the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly tossing the blame for the collapse of the structural magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims have gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane crash at the Grand Moscos in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried down the street.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the grieving chose their way and paid their respects to the victims when the first of the fallen made it to his last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
A sad message passed by the holy place, where just a few days earlier the construction crane smashed through the ceiling of the mosque and overthrew itself on the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funeral, and the Saudi king sanctioned the building group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which was also abandoned by 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after the crash of a crane in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the opening of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that a haj to the Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group was not supposed to leave the crane's shoulder up when it was not operational.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by a state-run Saudi news agency, says the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The English service of the disk agency did not report this detail, but said the company's bosses were banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are covering before the Haj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group issued no statement of the crane collapse and were not given to its representatives for comment.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the latest safety measures, and the lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been near the Saudi ruling family for decades and run major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a renegade who was renounced by the family in the 1990s.
The crash happened in the midst of strong winds and rain just days before the millions of people arrived in a pilgrimage in the kingdom, which must be at least once in their lives by every proficient Muslim.
Officials say 158 people are still staying in hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be donated to relatives of those killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern Europe traders working for cheap are already trending
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laura
The number of traders from Eastern Europe is past the point of growth
The result is an open 200 Screwfix stores targeting traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Processed by Rupert Steiner, the main correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be putting down hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home
If you're good with a hammer or a painter's brush, you seem to be in the minority today.
As the British increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out DIY work at their home, according to the company's chief executive behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the chain for home needs, argues that a large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix stores aimed at traders, closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms Laury claims she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better half.
Currently, most of them are male workers.
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends that show more female households making more home adjustments than in the past.
Ms. Laury says, "There are still mostly men working in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decision on purchases of goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies according to Britain's FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect equivalence between directors of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having half the representation of women among employees including executive and chief financial officer.
Ms Laura argues: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't difficult to find good women to take to us.
Kingfisher announced a slump in profits in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the cost of closing stores.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-chairman of TOP 09, who emphasized the principle of merit.
The chairman of the ODS Zbyněk Stanjura noted that the one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in standard valorisation, because it would be reflected in the years to come.
"We have room to find the mechanism by which we will arrange it," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which it was to be valorized beyond the law next year.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that she would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not rosy.
A higher valuation next year would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of valorization has reduced.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The veto of the right will make the payout significantly more difficult in December and perhaps make it impossible, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed shortening the deadline for discussing the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, and the right blocked it.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should be worth a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is to go especially from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Pensions are expected to rise by about a hundred crowns on average next year.
According to the pension amendment, the contribution should be given to people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those whose pension was lost in December before its payment.
However, they would have to apply for the surcharge in writing, no later than the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valorized as of January, by price growth and a third by real wage growth.
This year, the pension is equivalent to 41.5 percent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent 314.7 billion crowns on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more year-on-year, according to the state's closing account.
The spending on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget spending and 46 percent of all expenditures required by law.
The average full old-age pension rose by 104 to 10,714 crowns last year, according to data in the state's closing account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided a payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 pro rata pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, will pursue science.
The billionaire had a senate seat, according to Russian media, almost certain.
He was to represent the Western-Russian Kaliningrad region in the Federation Council, whose governor, Nikolai Tsukanov, as the candidate of the ruling United Russia party, defended his post in Sunday's elections.
Under Russian law, the senators are not elected by the citizens, but chosen by the governor from a trio of candidates whose names they will announce before the governor's elections.
After the election, the senator will choose a senator from three candidates himself.
The complication for Yakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
Although the Kremlin found an exception for Yakunin, he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, to whom the legal requirement of long-term residence does not apply.
The filming of the Czech comedy The Tiger Theory ended.
The last straw in the resolution of the main character is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janžurová decided on her grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he is on a similar path with his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom.
He longs to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the previous one, Slavík said.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in a comedy way in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would belong to Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
However, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with recovery after a serious illness, surprised him.
We agreed with each other three years ago.
I gave him a read script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised that he was probably a cocoon athlete.
He always asked where he would sit before filming the next scene.
This time he was riding his bike, climbing rocks and even walking up the hill.
And all this in record tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoška, women take a tiger to make him a rabbit over time.
They'll put a little food on him, but they'll close the door so he doesn't happen to think of playing the tiger outside of the rabbit house.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and means well.
But at the same time, she's a usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also describes in parallel the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and son-in-laws Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The US internet company Google has promised to provide an additional 5.5 million dollars (132.6 million CZK) to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing into Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, which is a charitable offshoot of the internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled Telich's part of the visit for criticism of human rights violations.
Czech MEP for the ANO movement Pavel Telička postponed the upcoming Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities today canceled the official part of the visit.
According to Telička, this is justified by last week’s EP resolution, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Telička was a co-author.
With the decision of the Azerbaijani party, Telika lost the possibility of talks with official partners and also a visit of political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press statement.
The trip, which was planned several months in advance, was intended to be used by Telička to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive and representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the Czech News Agency.
The EP condemns "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan."
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after a recent ruling over Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadija Ismail, who advocated for the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia has not ruled out building its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out that a Russian air base in Syria would be built in the future during a visit to Novosibirsk.
We don't have plans like that yet.
But nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia has an age-old naval base in Syria in the port of Tartus, which it has so far used more as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian press reports, however, since the beginning of August, supplies of Russian equipment and military equipment to Syria have risen.
According to Moscow, these are weapons shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians intend to establish an air base near the city of Latakiya, which for now remains a bastion of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, U.S. commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov about the situation in Syria on Tuesday, it was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow to convey concerns over the gathering of a Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Moscow a losing bet.
He said the goals of Russia’s policy in Syria were rather unclear.
Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is supposed to be the main topic of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to today’s speculation.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbass.
According to a report by The New York Times, the U.S. government has not ruled out that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during a U.N. meeting.
Opinions among White House advisers are said to be diverging.
The TASS news agency reported today, citing the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, that Putin has not yet had a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York stay.
Put on sesame oil during the gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing from cold seeds, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these have been the most common reason for the deaths of Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are a lover of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in the pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, problems with the gallbladder mainly affect people who are overweight who do not play sports and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used in the liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that the consumption of this oil brings, they should be careful about goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
However, the oil will lose all active substances, described Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in the Sokolov region, which produces cold-pressed organic virgin oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can press 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the extra virgin designation.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil thrives on heart and blood vessel diseases.
The Czech favorite among the oils is sunflower.
The research by Jarmila Hamerská, who led at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents prefer him in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, already at 180 °C it is starting to burn.
It is better to use it, for example, for the after-flavor of salads and is especially suitable in the diet, in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids most lower cholesterol.
With heart problems, you need to be careful about the amount of fat and calories generally accepted.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
As for the energy value of food, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts just like sesame and hemp 9 months.
Storage in the fridge will extend the shelf life.
Old oil is known especially by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no turbidity on the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Technical hemp seeds are among the so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This label is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself, and one has to take them from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams of it, while Icelanders accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about the use of cannabis oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to the consumers confirms the fact that Bohemia Oil is one of the best-selling companies.
It is sold 500 liters a year.
People often take one tablespoon on an empty ground in the morning.
Hemp oil is not in any way beneficial, but it will greatly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vlček from the Kraslice company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of barbecues is Americans.
There are 1.4 grills per household.
All over the world, various barbecue competitions are held, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs behind either.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have not grilled in their lives.
The vast majority then grill several times a year.
In order for the grilling to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating several hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is best for this and at the same time leaves healthy substances when grilling?
In general, during the grilling process itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body beneficial substances, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils do not find their use when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When meat is said, experts from the company Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in the Sokolov region immediately recall grapeseed oil.
It wonderfully complements the taste of meats and fish.
The kitchen has a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, it retains health-protecting substances as one of the few oils, Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Olej, which belongs to the few Czech producers of this grape vine oil, describes the benefits of grapeseed oil.
Experts agree that grapeseed oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Due to the favorable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to enhance our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when flavoring salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
During the grilling, you can use two ways, for marinating and grilling itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we preserve their juiciness.
When preparing the marinade, three components must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we add acidity to apple cider vinegar and soften the meat.
The spices, in turn, give the meat a taste and the oil preserves and adds the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, he adds that grapeseed oil is ideal for marinating because it can permeate through dark meat as one of the few oils.
Marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare dishes.
The same goes for barbecues.
Some oils are absolutely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Rub the griddle with oil before grilling to prevent food from burning.
A necessary part of the barbecue is also the preparation of side dishes.
The grilled meat and fish are suitable for practically anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Ole recommend, for example, the salad Hot Summer.
To it you need: • 1 pc of peach • 1 bunch of arugula • 1 cup of chopped cucumber • 1 cup of a mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grapeseed oil
Add the rugula, chopped cucumbers and chopped peach to the salad bowl with a mixture of salad leaves.
Season with salt and pepper to taste, you can also season with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drizzle with a few drops of grapeseed oil.
For exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it is not only the drugs that matter, but also the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, the care of these patients includes social and legal counseling, recommendations for housing modification, etc.
Still, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally affected by the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
As doctors point out, the passivity of patients frees up space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it is proven that regular movement greatly delays the time when the patient needs some compensatory aid, for example, a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not submit to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That is why the Dej chance page (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give Yourself a Chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, twice the adage applies that the sooner the disease begins to be treated, the more likely the doctor may affect something.
This is because we have multiple sclerosis drugs at an inflammatory stage when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay disability, explains Dr. Eva Medová from the Neurology Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, relieve swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the specific difficulties of the patient," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, Chief of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the University Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in everyone in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that the sick verify what they can do, and this strengthens their confidence.
"Endorphins are also flushed out during exercise and a person feels good after it," PhDr points out. Kamila Řasová from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of the University Hospital Royal Vinohrady.
By affecting the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We directly interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were so-called saved, today we know they need a targeted burden," says prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, Head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the University Hospital in Motol.
The goal of physiotherapy is to keep one from being self-sufficient for as long as possible, including job title.
Therefore, physiotherapists cooperate with occupational therapists so that each person receives a compensatory aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, it usually shakes people.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
They have to respond to a big burden - a loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we are to go to someone, not trying to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them so that they eventually come to the conclusion that even with a disability it is possible to live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurology Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses would not fly.
Aviation production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which can not be manufactured and processed.
Still, in addition to super-precision, computer-controlled machine tools, in addition to autoclaves for shaping composites, you can come across something as ordinary as apricot stones.
In the drum, which resembles a pot of cotton candy, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are tumbled in a pile of stones.
"So far, no one has found anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of air door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague Letňany, the former Letov produces complete doors for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to supply the door for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
Passengers entering the first and upper class on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner, the Airbus A380, also enter the door, part of which is assembled in Prague.
There are also doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Precision is the main motto here.
For example, the company has the moment keys adjusted twice a year.
If the yellow sticker lacks a record of inspection, they should explain in the Prague plant to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who regularly drive to see if the door is made according to the agreed rules.
However, the advanced technology has not yet completely replaced the human senses.
There are 1500 rivets on one door to the A320.
You have to shake the riveters by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the impacting hammer, they will know if the rivet is already properly shaken.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
During the inspection, it is the turn of the trained touch.
When the controller runs his finger over a row of rivets, he can tell if any are out of tolerance.
Then he picks up the exact handler.
Letov fed the program of the training military aircraft L-39 before 1989.
In 1991, however, not a single one was produced.
The company quickly had to find new orders.
It was then put together with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a tender for an emergency door supplier for the A321.
The courtship with Boeing was not so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money for investments and for Boeing to guarantee long-term stable deliveries," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would have been slammed if Letov had not impressed the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the international aviation industry association in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French started, Dubsky says.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
In 2000, the installation of parts of the door for the A320 started.
Three years later, the door of the upper deck for the A380 was added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have gotten to these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we'd do parts or small parts.
The partners want a guarantee of supplies for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of more than 2.9 billion and profit after tax 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and qualification cards for key employees.
Without them, the company would not produce any aircraft doors.
Obtaining certificates that the production processes correspond to the requirements of the customers and in repeated inspections to keep them costs, according to Dubský, millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and stricter.
We have to train employees, retrofit the equipment and certify the whole process again, adds Dubský.
Now the company is finalizing the preparation of a process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the existing harmful cadmium for human health.
They received the assignment from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people of Boeing will come, check the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, approaching the Dubsky way in which customers check them.
The reward is the Prague company long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embraos is and is falling.
For the A320, it produces half of the total volume of the door.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
However, this does not mean that he can say any price at the door.
The contract includes a price curve.
It indicates how much one door will cost after ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price per piece still drops to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price pattern.
If we don't, we'll lose, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall where the electric cabinets for the military Airbus A400 M are assembled is still empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, a new semi-robotic line for riveting and installation of doors for the innovative A320 Neo is being built.
Riveting will speed up and refine.
"This is the trend that is taking assembly in aviation," adds Dubský.
The sale has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 units of the new A320.
Just a few meters next to it, a line will be created for the complete installation of doors for the A380 upper deck.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The goal is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin within two years, Dubsky says.
Before that, however, the company must pass the qualification tests, for example, for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company when it can process composites in addition to metal materials," says Dubský proudly.
However, Latecoere is on the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no other place in the Letov area where it is located.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now he has 800, and within three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are competing to see how many new planes the airline orders each year, they may not be worried about their jobs.
Although it has contracts for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague’s Latecoere faced a threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for September's loan payments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to reach an agreement with the main creditors.
At the end of August, part of the loans were exchanged for shares.
Creditors gained a 37.4 percent stake in the company by raising capital by 57.4 million euros.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, or 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company subscribed to the existing shareholders for new shares for 222.9 million euros.
In total, it raised the share capital by 280 million euros.
In doing so, the entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which accounts for 85 percent of sales.
He expects average order growth of four percent a year until 2017.
In the custom book, it has orders for 2.6 billion euros, equivalent to four-year production.
French media say Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on drips.
The Czech race in Prague Letňany is important for the groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group's sales.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
MPs have backed a larger share of the state from coal charges.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring 427 million crowns more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of municipal budgets is supposed to have a neutral impact, because the fee is supposed to be higher.
Last year, municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget received 150 million crowns.
About 200 million crowns and the state went to the municipalities from brown coal mining.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the payment from the mining areas with the permitted mining to a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these reimbursements should continue to belong to municipalities in full.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that municipalities would receive between 14 million and 100 million crowns per year instead of 14 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but it will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The reimbursement is newly calculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the setting of the fee by a government order may not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining are charged.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter will be given to the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of radioactive rock mining.
A portion of the money that the state collects on mining fees will be purpose-bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide the mining emergency service.
The draft was criticised today by opposition MPs, who said in particular that it would harm municipalities affected by mining and regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have been, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the Ústí Region.
The KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned against the rise in unemployment in the Most region.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed rejecting the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining firms, the fee increase will not translate into coal prices because prices are more than 90 percent long-term contracted.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean reducing the number of employees," the government admits.
However, she said the increase in employment fees is tolerable.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment by Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government’s decision on the limits of coal mining before the law is passed.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on yields for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek in that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak army should fall only after 2020.
According to him, the limits on the CSA mine should be broken already for reasons of social, national economic and because of the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The entire world is watching the US Federal Reserve prepare to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make crucial decisions about whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists approached by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will remain idle for some time yet, leaving interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because the flight has passed since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank in chief could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates," says Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has fared relatively well, recovering in the form of adding a trillion dollars to the state account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.
They warned markets to be prepared for the increase, but circumstances suggest they also see great chances against the move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20:00 CET.
A gunman at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on that day his colleague - wrote a message claiming he was "sorry" for the first murder and that he wished he could take it back, government officials revealed Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social sciences teacher at Delta State University, called the police Monday morning around 10am
and said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police officers to his house.
He said: "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "cute dog" in the house who "will not bother anyone" but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was shot.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb, saying: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me.'
After leaving a message, Lamb made the 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
The university's dean, William LaForge, said he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "in Mr. Lamb's head, something was obviously going on."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed Amy Prentiss's romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was "no evidence" of the "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was "a great person."
The divorce occurred 15 years ago, but both remained friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was "shaken" by the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "the best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss's, as Sun Herald reported, Prentiss worked from the house over the internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would "not go to jail."
When officers caught up with him on a highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a resume he published on the school's website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at the University of Delta in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their magic
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He battled leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett in 2009 due to cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was detained for drug possession in 2008.
All of these things are certainly taking their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double-fault right-footed fracture during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back left this injury in tears and knocked him out of the game for a minimum of six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke through into the PSV space.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and an oxygen mask was also needed before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in hospital."
He will be taken over tomorrow or possibly the day after and then further operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a kid who comes to Manchester at 18 has it very hard but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will still play this season.
Moreno was very lucky not to get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall indicated the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both feet.
A tweet from Shawa's account says: "Thank you all for their messages, words can't express how devastated I am, my path to recovery starts now and I'll come back even stronger."
Related: Manchaster United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeat against PSV
The England defender will have an added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the pitch with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention wasn't to injure the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said in a statement.
I was unable to see this moment.
I only saw the ball heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see the procedure on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's procedure.
David Cameron certainly knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn’t take long to learn it almost by heart.
You must not be David Cameron.
When asked by a children's scheme provider to name a favorite children's book, Prime Minister Lorax, a fable from Dr Seusse from 1971, chose.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in a report posted on SuperCamps' website and continues: "Funny, touching, creative and with strong content, such I like to read to my children because behind it was always an image or message I hadn't seen before."
Well, except in the following paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book by an elevator from a 2012 film that added more characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is the brief content of the book, which records the object of love unknown to Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodore Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it wasn't suspicious enough, the text delivered by Cameron reads like the summary elevator of the film Lorax, which finds them on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not get acquainted with the story of a book where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the raking, trees-felling industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title-time Lorax, a crouched, mustache-like creature who "speaks for trees."
Most likely, such a relatively minor PR task was given to a helper who had never read to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to come from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in jeopardy of England's omission but still holding
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team England selected for this tour, I think a repeat of the 3-0 defeat she suffered last time in the rehearsal series will be unlikely.
I wouldn't directly rule out winning guests either.
Alastair Cook's party may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting line-up and also the collective thinking is strong; they won't bear the 2012 scars of only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is an emerging spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of England's team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is a tough deal for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good attacks in challenging conditions and a simple but tough reality is that cricket players are judged based on performance.
For example, there were no question marks around the Joe Root name, which led to the announcement because — and I’ve mentioned this before — players are their best selectors.
A few more half-centuries, and Lyth could extend his series, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, another opportunity will emerge.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his stance, even though his performances were not quite a hundred percent, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a batcher gets to show up is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only thing you could say about is that England gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean first — even though Lyth was in the best shape — but this wasted opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and that's the batsman I rate very positively.
He's an x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season when he won 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field, which he kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity his predecessors have been given, but all of this will of course depend on the overall line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while retaining four quicks, has been exaggerated and I have no objections to it.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't bat and this left-handed man has already shown that he is an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and there's not much difference.
My former team-mate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
He immediately succeeded for three centuries and did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, he intrigued me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a slingshot, but there aren’t a lot of spinners to raise their hands, and the selectors have decided on a youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England appear to have made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches can be a championship move.
He is one of the most beautifully played guys who will bring a wealth of experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless spark to the team.
I always felt that he was directly born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's team-mate Ben Stokes was given a one-day day off, just as Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many disagree on this, coaches and selectors do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts stagnating by 2017.
David Cameron's misconception strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with every passing day without the election of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn will take over the working party, or the TUC will take on the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some member states already have enough of Britain's egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At its one-year meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn't want it even if they eroded social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an uninvoluted Britain in European Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before she becomes bad, as was the case with too long-overdue Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's difficult to watch them break their feet in helping Selfie Brits, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may plan deliberately unhelpful SNP-style remarks during the campaign before the 2017 UK referendum to hasten the Brexit process, a friend argues.
"Renegotiation has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from negotiations."
Europeans, to their own detriment, know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the EU are the press oligarchs of the barons, because they were not during a referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975 that supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They can vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, a deceitful Euro-opportunist who made his name as Brussels's rapporteur, "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of rogues not paying taxes, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo-non-season departments that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a frenzied gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she wouldn't put you down for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of a repealed EU constitution that was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and got him a card of being fired.
The press never forgave him, either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back of a friendly on Monday in Westminster - I told him he must no longer waste his time on me - seems to be in danger of re-recommitting the strategy of boycotting Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is evolving, I'll say nicely.
He says he would like to remain in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the furious tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly approach that.
The same thing Hilary said "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on both radio and television this week when his inner scout could not commit to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "at all times" - Benna's phrase - apparently wasn't what McDonnell was saying or what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - don't forget, he touched me - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of all-day television transmission and especially in the whirlwind, the steaming of paranoia and betrayal, which is social media
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to regard the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign as a matter of course, as McDonnell put it.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic squirm about EU membership - in line with their Bennite-besieging economy, the anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his squirming about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign won't want to end it - foreign diplomats will be required to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with Britain's "weak military output in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of the Conservative government in power, as I was reminded of at Monday's launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise review of electronics published by Public Health England
A statement by the government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry, the researchers say.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet's criticism of the evidence used in its e-cigarette report by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published a "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the data's comprehensiveness and highlighted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the professional journal Lancet last month attacked an "extraordinarily poor base" on which the PHE agency based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ questioned the claims, which were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They indicate that the public could expect that the PHE agency's claim, which is "the current best estimate, is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to draw up an analysis of the multi-criteria (MCDA) decision of the model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO has reportedly previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the BAT public health mandate in a sustainability report, he states.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting acknowledged funding from the e-cigarette maker, but not the funding it allegedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industrial funding in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are unknown for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE was also attended by tobacco management.
The report, arose in this group, "eloquently admits," the missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and welfare at PHE, said the claims in BMJ had already been answered before.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers dies because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but we need to continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and also what they don't show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly highlighting current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should quit EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
The former Channel 4 director, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "put their right hand" behind hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programmes not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, which will likely be watched by only a handful of people, into complex broadcasting times over his rivals "the biggest credit rating show, and on channels like the BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he was unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would surely be broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson said on the Communications Commission in the Upper House, as part of negotiations on the BBC's future.
If you keep royalties that I'm not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation of at least programmes that others do not produce or don't enter should be reduced.
They broadcast The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and understandably pointless.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and understandably produced on home soil.
Sincerely, other channels would give their right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty by catching up with ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular show repeats those that former Sky executive director, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said even the BBC's more pampered public service programmes "pass to BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they fulfill their authority and can argue when they are preparing for their hypocritical mission of justifying £4bn income from royalties, "But of course we are doing all these obscure programmes that no one is looking at."
They're broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the royalty, Johnson told the commission: "I call on you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people for whom there are 150 pounds a lot, I would be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look at the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director, David Elstein, who spoke before the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production has now previously been classified as educational - it used to be 1% television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take public broadcasting in Australia and Canada as a role model and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like Proms, of which only a handful were broadcast on television, and connect with commercial reporters so we can see them all online.
“Sonogenetics” or control of brain cells by means of sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the nematodes move.
The researchers raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
The small nematodes change direction when they are struck by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
The researchers said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are injected into the patient's brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani has found that the reaction occurs when they are placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found, bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves act in the ion channels of TRP-4, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are associated with, according to a report by the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the tRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to such modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method in many ways resembles optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
But Chalasani said sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate the tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of insulin-producing muscle cells and cells.

Advertisements disgracing the British arms trade.
Watch a video about Amnesty International's anti-weapons market.
Terrible killer drones!
Leg shackles that break the ankles!
Slit missiles!
And electric stunning batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no traces!
The cheerful voice and cartoon of the metaphor leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world’s largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to sell weapons to punitive regimes through the defense and security equipment of the International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in the Docklands district of London.

But a separate campaign is also being conducted with the emergence of posters at bus stops and subways that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Travel to DPR from September 15-18?" reads one, using fonts with the signs of the London Underground with DLR lines becomes a picture of the tank.
This September, the swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DPR ... Customers are being asked to help stop the arms deal.
On 300 posters, artists exhibit their works at the Museum of Cruel Design at Banksy Dismaland.
The team called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute them throughout London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs," which is £6 apiece of Allen key that supposedly "gets access to roughly a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists switch to working with activists within protest movements and realize that they need to get out in the real world to have an impact on society.

Amnesty's video was viewed on Facebook by more than 100 000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without a fee, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the ads about the arms trade - he saw the void on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with creating more realistic risky corporate ads, but "by adding colorful colors and animation, we've achieved more people's attractions."
"They've done a fantastic job and helped us raise our concerns about selling illegal torture tools at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms store comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military on "on the arm of the launch AT4CS RS."
This includes "a uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
11 years ago, I moved into student dorms like an oblivious nineteen-year-old, still religious in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those I bothered - and numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the tracks can range from slightly to nerves going to totally appalling.
It's tempting to babble: tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year's break, what do you think of Corbyn, and why "you honestly don't love or hate Marmit, because people, it's just HAHAHA's yeast extract, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath too - ask and show interest.
It manages the conversation and helps you find the people you love and the people you don't enjoy even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would make fire extinguishers.
Leave people space.
People's rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie evenings and communal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts in college come up short.
Your room should be a refuge, yet a lot of dorms are transformed into an extra-room walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This can be hell for someone who needs to charge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I used up to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write him a place of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
One of the guys in my dorms used to know that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends through baking.
Because you started going to university at the top of a baking mania, knocking on a stranger's door, and a performance with a slice of baked cakes seems slightly less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked something for you, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Making homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe everything will end up being assigned to a tasty surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and stiffness are likely to break off that others will fake sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Food theft is a common crime in student dorms.
Theft of a whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're rampant inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more grown-up than my roommate, who swapped her milk for a dishwashing detergent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make noises that distract people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, it's also about the famous people in glass houses.
The girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could down a little bit drum and bass because they were 3 at night and she had a test in the morning.
Their response was to amplify music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours, and then let go of her own music out loud, locked the door, and left for her three-hour tex.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband went to the same tracks as you?
Conversely, wouldn't it be appallingly embarrassing if you mistook your roommates for your future wife, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe take control of your mutual friends, too?
Of course, you can't command your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future chot, try to talk to your weaknesses at least a little.
In the uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door and put the keys in a water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their things on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a hard time already during her pregnancy with the seven-year-old Vítek.
His father broke up with her and was alone in preparing and raising her offspring.
I coped with the situation quite quickly - I was very much looking forward to the child and I was looking for positives in it.
Uncertainty and being alone with the baby, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had hope in me that we will not be alone for a long time, Eva remembers her first pregnancy today.
Already at that time she met on the Internet on the chat of the older Vašek, with whom they began to talk about favorite movies.
Vasek even brought Eva and Vítek home from the hospital, but he did not rush into the role of his stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The motive of the third season of the Czech TV series is precisely the search for happiness for the second attempt.
She managed to take care of Vítek and financial security of the family thanks to her part-time work and great help from her mother and the help of her aunt.
Even the prospects of responsibility for a foreign child ultimately did not spoil Vašek’s affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vítek's second birthday, and now he understands Vašek as his dad and also addresses him that way.
Although Vašek already has two adult daughters, he enjoys fatherhood at sixty and is also more dedicated to children.
In addition to Vítek, they were joined by two-year-old Leontýnka and finally twins.
"Vašek came into our family somehow naturally, maybe even by the fact that my mother never talked much into my relationships," Eva thinks.
Not enough space?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which are then in excess of pregnancy in the blood and are manifested mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth usually spontaneously subsides.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Vašek's happiness, even though they were only at 36 weeks.
The Emička was placed in an incubator in the intermediary department, where Vašek’s niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after transferring from the ICU to the room I had her with me, describes a challenging period after childbirth Eva.
She spent twenty days in the hospital until the doctors agreed to release the babies, who had managed to reach the two-pound mark.
Waiting for the weight of children in the hospital did not make Eva happy.
"I was crazy about my husband and children's homesickness," a four-time mother recalls of the difficult moments in the six-month-old's ward.
She and her husband were also considering signing the reverse, including because of the insensitive attitude of one of the doctors.
In the end, however, this did not happen and doctors discharged Eva and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45.
A large family can humble themselves.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric two-burner and cramped conditions.
The house did not increase, but Vašek made Eva happy by mounting the gas cooker to make the preparation of food for six people more comfortable.
If he's the worst, we'll take turns taking turns taking a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or shability of the house.
For now, we've been putting together very nicely, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and we sometimes cross the round babies, but at least we are all close, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side of every situation.
Vašek’s work as a lighting lighter in a film is not a guarantee of regular reception.
That's why he sometimes goes out on the streets of Prague like a taxi driver.
At the age of sixty, he said, he physically manages to care for the finances of families and children, but how long will it be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be me one day who will feed this family," Eva admits flatly when asked about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four children, I'm not exactly a terne for employers.
And when it's the worst, my husband and I can take turns taking a taxi, jokes a sympathetic blonde.
Apple has suffered a yo-yo effect.
It's all the display.
A more powerful processor, a camera with greater resolution, a stronger chassis or a touch-recognizing display, are in short the advantages of recently introduced iPhones of the ninth generation.
The last two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s trend so far has been that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exceptions were only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference to the detriment of the new product was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams in the smaller model, and by 20 grams in larger ones.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year's affair of bending in the pockets of Apple suffered greatly.
The chassis of the novelties is made of the more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on it.
Apple used 3D Touch technology to recognize the power of touch.
To do this, it was necessary to provide the display with an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the new iPhones has thus increased more than twice as much as previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of a larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
For the iPhone 6s, the display is the heaviest component used.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved with this novelty also thanks to the slimming bark, which touched most of the remaining components.
For the larger model, the most difficult element of the battery is used, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is evident in the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
To the extent that the new display technology is practical, it will only become apparent when used.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday, September 25, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Have the flakes of the champion's breakfast been tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have succeeded in finding which opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of the settlement by modern man from different times, including wall paintings, tool residues, and so on and so forth.
In layer 23A, which according to the tools is dated to about 30 thousand years ago, but scientists have discovered something that very much resembles the remnants of a breakfast buffet.
There were traces of oatmeal on the site, which apparently went through the process of producing today's popular flakes.
In it, the grains are first soaked, then dried, removed from the packaging, the so-called pluch, then steamed and pressed flat.
In the cave of Paglicec managed to discover grains that were apparently heated or steamed, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this is evidenced by traces of use on two stones in the cave.
So the researchers could not prove in their publication for the journal PNAS that a complete process of flake production would take place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could have eaten flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly warm, of course, is quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensely people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes were ahead of agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New station reports in the Brno City Transport Company.
So I listened once again to the reports of the names of the trolleybus stops: Hnusáček, Ghost, Phrázova, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was a little noisier, so the report by the male voice was somewhat less understandable than before when the stops were reported in a female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic is better discernible than the deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know, who, I was not asked by anyone, but they certainly chose this from studio recordings made in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than in the noise of the bus engine.
I have been living in Brno for a few decades, so I know the correct names of all the stops by heart, so I do not need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere who are not familiar in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended can be confused and can be confused on the final, where they accidentally arrived, then claim that the stop at which they were supposed to get off was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of the announcer - but better again - should be done again, and this time colored by the normal traffic noise and the rumbling of the engine, in which the whining of the speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So that we do not have to listen to the names of the stations of Vodní Heršpice, Šmírov, or then Submersible in the screeching shalina, to which I transferred in Komárov.
I suppose my old man's hearing didn't suddenly get that bad during that one day when the announcer of the stops changed.
I understood the report pretty well before that day.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the tracker's notes.
Today, few people know what the biggest and smartest things were during the party’s rule were the so-called comprehensive clearances.
I took the liberty of remembering it.
The bus was delayed.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office when it was said on the radio that it was just seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't collide with Comrade Chief, he came a minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher remarked while I wrote in the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be sure.
Write me that I'm going after precincts to revise minor mechanization.
It won't work, today is clearance.
Everyone's fucking out of it, almost horrible.
What's going on, anyway?
"You'll see," the dispatcher sneered.
Next time you'll be too.
I ran out into the hallway.
Then the door of the chieftain opened and the chief appeared.
Uptight, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I greeted respectfully, quickly fastening two buttons of the jacket of the uniform.
"Good morning," the reply said, and I quickly ran up to the second floor, not realizing the cold, ominous tone the old one answered.
"You're messing around," said the engineer Eva, an elderly lady I respected very much.
She was even a chief before her was deposed by the comrades.
There's clearances, and you're gonna arrive like this.
How many times have I asked what complex clearances are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say they're once every three years, they all have to go to them, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I'll see, though.
I pulled a fascicle of periodic reports and the phone.
"Holcman here, come to me right now," the chief's voice said.
What's poisoning?
Now we've met and nothing..." I muttered, but no one answered me, everyone just with their thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I've come at your command," I said, and I joined the chief of the chief of staff.
The chief sat behind his desk, looking at some leach.
"Comrade mechanizer," he said after a moment, without raising his head, and still carefully examining the lestro, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the leacher on the table, leaned back into the back of the chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, bad, prickly gaze.
I was insecure.
What's happening?
Just yesterday, the deputy praised the fact that in the last few months in office I have worked very well and that he is very happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the platoon on a distance.
Now this?
Realize that you're a track distance technician and you have to behave accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I have been stuttering that I have been using such a greeting since I was a child, that I have been so educated and that I see nothing wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red rag for a turkey.
"You're on a socialist railway, and the only acceptable greeting is an honor to work," the chief said.
Plus, you're still confusing the approach of your superiors.
One day you'll say "sir" and the second time you'll say "comrade."
But I'm not the chief for you, but Comrade Chief.
The deputys are the deputys, the top trackmasters are the top trackmasters!
Please remember that!
I'm sorry, Mr... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a common civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of work, or comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
"It's not your preference that you're not in the party," said the chief, who had calmed down a little.
But we will talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have your retirement chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it didn't look good with the person in question.
He stabbed me for a moment with a cold, prickly look, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his patronizing typing.
He was only a few years older and played the Lord, comrade, actually comrade.
The jovial, the cocky, the authoritarian, the arrogant, how it suited him at the moment.
They all shoved him.
So, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, like all the party members, told him, but also to the non-partisans.
But the chief was talking to many, especially those in whom he could assert his superiority.
Right now, he's wiped me for complete bullshit.
I thought something about my ass, and it cost me enough to keep me from shooting it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the pickaxe, let alone continue to be a railway official.
What would I make a living from two kids?
And the built-up house!
I was crying, but I controlled myself.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," the chief ended the audience, and began to look again carefully at the lejstra he had in his hand.
At half-past twelve, I was summoned.
Everyone in the office was already there, and they were answering questions about what and how, that it was going to be good.
Only Jojin spoke bitingly, as it used to be, that they could not throw us all away, because the chief would have to do the job himself with his faithful, and that he was not in danger.
The word "comrade" emphasized as if he knew what the old man had wiped me for this morning.
There was a nice gathering in the chief office.
Comrade Chief behind his desk and at the long advisory table other comrades who were to decide on my official being or non-being.
Kádrovák, chairman of the ROH, recorder from personnel, officer for special purposes, something in the manner of a counter in the military, and a deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from a streak.
An ordinary track worker, undercutting a sleeper or throwing gravel with a pitchfork.
But also a former guard.
It was said that there was no fun with him at the time, a pretty beast.
The evil tongues claimed that the school was published in the seventh grade, he did not learn anything, he did nothing.
And when the criminals were abolished, he ended up on a streak at the pickaxe.
But the comrade, yeah, the comrade was forged!
The chief motioned for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an insolvable cone in my throat.
The cadre read the opinion from the civic committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two children and so on and so on.
It's good so far, I thought, and I've had a little better breathing.
Then an opinion from the street organization of the party.
He copied the opinion from the civic committee, perhaps both of them were written by the same man.
But then it came!
Parents of long-standing members of the party, refused to appear before the review committee and subsequently withdrew from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The cadre noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief motioned that he should continue.
It was only worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee and there I was won for the party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I had a wedding in the church besides the national committee.
I failed the party's confidence in the worst way.
That's why I was removed from the ranks of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even when she died, I arranged a church funeral, although she was a former member of the party.
By all this, I am showing a negative attitude towards the leadership role of the party.
When the cadre read, only the tapping of the chief's pencil into the table top was interrupted by a tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wanted to be somewhere far away.
At the same time, I kept repeating in my mind "The Communists - the superhumans, the communists - the superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could have repaired the switches without any fucking clearance.
But now?
The career of the railway official took over before it had begun.
Going back to the platoon?
I don't think it's possible, the chief will definitely fire me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade here?" the chief interrupted with a tense silence by asking the cadre.
Well, according to the previous job report.
You got him here?
Clearly, the cadre was not twice.
On the shocks of a drop of sweat, he blinked nervously, as if he himself had been screened.
He nodded zealously and handed the chief a piece of paper.
"Well," said the chief, with a hint of joviality, which was often a harbinger of a storm.
At first glance, praise, taught with honors, studied industrial, worked in the task wage as a locksmith, performed the norm on average to one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essentials are missing.
Where did you get the assessment from, comrade?" he said again to the cadre, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him and that he might not even be a cadre very soon.
The comrade here gave it to me, at the onset.
That was enough for you?
"Well, when he came up to us, he went to the platoon for the precinct," the cadre bluzzed.
And there the assessments are not required, his was somehow extra, so I put it in his file.
"So, when you were assigned to the technical office, this scrap of paper was enough for you," the chief said dryly.
The cadre was winking nervously, and he had no answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss it later," the chief concluded, apparently relieved the cadre.
For now, he's held on.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief said again to me.
Suddenly he's telling me, that's the end of it!
My eyes were dark, the heat was pouring.
There followed a flurry of remorse and accusations, and I knew that I was the most vile creature in the world who deserved the slightest mercy.
That by slipping an incomplete opinion, I misled the comrade of the cadre officer, and I did not understand why the assessment was incomplete when I got it from a cadre in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element that, at the time of the building of real socialism, supports the realms of religious obscurity, indeed, even participates in them.
That, that, there was a lot I've done, or maybe I'll still commit, and I've been quietly praying that it's over.
I didn't care about everything.
I didn't care if I left the seat of mechanizer.
I didn't care if they took the pickaxe from me.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of Comrade Chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," the party leader said suddenly, vigorously interrupting the chief's levities.
Here, the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did stupid thing!
He has already received his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than that we would shut the door to his side for a time!
To reopen to him, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so well-read or parroted phrases from partisan training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade has to get a chance from us!
A chance to prove that he has changed.
And who's supposed to give it to him if you're not the one, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, truthful, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to remedy it!
It's your party duty that no one can take away from you!
In fact, it's a party duty to all of us.
Here, the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman finished, no one even looked.
No one expected such a turn of the situation.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief said icefully, trying to take the initiative again.
If you had let me finish, you would have heard that this is the conclusion I was aiming.
They all nodded in agreement, but it was obvious that they believed a word of it.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate officer of care for basic funds," I holed when I returned to the office and then started to cry.
Good thing, except for the engineer Eva, they were all at lunch.
She listened in silence to my incoherent description of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked if I'd like a coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the cooker and prepared the cups.
Meanwhile, she was talking about cadre practices.
How they give one opinion, often full of praise, in the hand, and the other, in which any dirt is, send to the new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to be, but on a streak at a pickaxe, so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He just cares where he would eat or drink what, and so it turned out the way it turned out.
"He'll get it from the old one," she said maliciously.
He won't like it today.
Still, watch out for him, he's pretty vengeful.
And the party chairman?
A far worse chief, no people.
Zero from a pickaxe having great power.
The water for coffee began to boil, and then the office filled with the smell of just-filled coffee.
I threw a cube of sugar into a cup and stirred the hot potion in silence.
I hope I'm from the worst outside.
I'm not fired now, and the next clearances are in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief won't just forget me today.
It was published in the anthology LITERATES ON THE LINE II. in the publishing house EPIKA
The symbol of the village has come to life.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is spinning again after years.
It can be seen by far because it is located on a fifteen-meter-high mast.
People from around the country call him "the fan on Chlum."
For the village with 150 inhabitants, it became even one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality gained on the occasion of the meeting of natives in 2010.
"We applied for a sign at the time and of course we wanted to have a fan on the emblem, everyone knows it in the vicinity," said the mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a memento of the present: it reminds us of a time when people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Chlum councillors decided on a solution that then suited until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the turnoff to Číchov, they had a seven-meter-deep well excavated.
Three years later, the well was complemented by a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by the company Antonín Kunc from Hranice in Moravia with a cost of 2 400 crowns," states the commemorative inscription on the ground-floor fence of the structure of the mast.
The pump after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter began to be written on the fight for water: that day a new water supply began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a local rarity.
The dominant was put into operation at this year's meeting of natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlums decided to repair the wind wheel again and restart the operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - reduced by an average of half a meter.
The bike was mounted on a mast, but the same year it had to be brought down.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel could not resist wind gusts.
Then the chlum dominant rested for several years dismantled under the roof.
Since June this year, however, the round on the high mast is spinning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the natives, the village had the replica of the bike modified and again put it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws utility water from the well only to the overflow blind shoulder.
And during the summer we completely disconnected it, because there was little water in the well.
It was at least empty.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the shaft of the wind wheel from the pump in the suction basket again," Mayor Mašek explained.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel got into the municipal emblem, but it is the only village of this kind in the whole Highlands.
In honor of local technical monuments, they have a similar element in honor of local technical monuments, for example, in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in the Vyškov region, in Kuzelov in the Hodonín region, Partutovice in the Přerov region or in the Police in the Vsetín region.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafata, admitted the support of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the game against Slavia very well, even my goal, like all of them in my career," 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-match press conference.
We were coached by Georghe Hagi back then, it was bad luck that we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
Only with the difference that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 games for the Romanian team, is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the raids of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says Spartan Hybš about the Greek fight.
And in part, he knows what might be waiting for him on Thursday night.
I know Fatai, who played in Astra, Romania, with my brother Lucian.
I saw all their struggles at the time.
I know he's a very good striker, that's why he also went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not name other footballers of the Prague club, so the direct question came whether he knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and, with a slightly reproachful look, aimed at Czech journalists.
The clueless look on his face was, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment's silence, he lowered.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta played a lot of team.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone else but Fatai.
The Spartans know that very well about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is such a their organizer of the game," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has already had the best years, but he boasts a very interesting football resume.
Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both United and City of Manchester were interested in him, but from Steaua he headed to Palermo, Italy, and played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're expecting an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European Cups, fighting for victory in the Czech league.
For me, he's a favorite in this match, but we're playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in a room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very much looking forward to his opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola moves from Poland to the Czech Republic, considers entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland because of trading the company's shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the group headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken in the project for the time being are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a de facto impact on the company, says Daniel Buryš, Chief Financial Officer of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's registered office, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry on the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is finalizing a securities prospectus, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval shortly.
The transfer of the registered office of the holding and the related transfers of shares will be made in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating in it.
Therefore, no shares will be offered for subscription to the public or to new investors in this operation.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in 4. Quarter 2015 or in 1. quarter of 2016," the company said.
The firm has previously said that a possible share offering could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of objectivity of Czech Television in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the coverage of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time broadcasting the main news session of Czech Television.
And how did she stand?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can play today’s broadcast of Czech Television Events.
About 80% of the news broadcasts were devoted to the migrant crisis.
It was not until the first minute that ČT reported on the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and called the attacks of migrants on police officers euphemistically patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current pro-migrant propaganda was already going - judge for yourself the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for nonprofits that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Traveling refugees - ČT consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee and not a migrant.
What is striking is that ČT uses only and only shots of young children and women in illustrative shots.
She said in the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that is unparalleled from communist agits.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once reached a block of flats, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
I had fish moved into the umakarta toilet.
Domestic fish, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., not losing the transformation from a caterpillar to a beetle and a cub looks like an adult, only it is small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me and I didn't lazy to kill them.
First by hand and later chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some blue crystals for their destruction.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, it destroyed them successfully.
Later, I did the same with the pharaohs.
A box of juvenalizers that the ants had brought to their nests and he would not allow the Queen to generate new offspring.
But that's what I turned.
As time went on, insects became the subject of my admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have taken away the experience from my life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace the other.
The truth in fleas and bugs, I don't think I'd hesitate to make the karma worse by killing them.
In the new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the ponds do not crawl behind our necks, let them eat in peace the crisps of apostate skin, some invisible algae and the like.
Their peaceful existence was disrupted by the spider after a while.
He was a common kind of fool who had long resided on the ceiling.
We thought he lived off occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he spent several years with us, we found out that he mainly feeds on fish and that his number apparently kept on the tolerable numerical state.
With intimate regular contact with each need, we found out that she is a female.
We witnessed romantic courtship with a partner of about a third smaller, how carefully he tingles on the fibers of the web, so that it would not be eaten before he reached the coveted copulation.
It took about three days when they didn't move and even respond to our checks.
Under the toilet bowl where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider did not move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging around it.
They soon disappeared.
They were eaten by their mother, they were dissolved elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went somewhere else or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the bathroomgone of the bathroom.
For a while, from the ceiling, she cautiously observed our behavior and, by moving under the toilet bowl, assessed our non-aggression as a friendship.
The number of somewhat multiplied fishteers has decreased again, and the spider has been looking at its normal activities in peace to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
Our daughter, in between, has grown into an age when the use of potty has already been a disgrace.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal pouring out of its content has already been eaten.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more forcefully.
But the daughter found an excuse in that spider to keep her habit, which she could see very well in the wiping.
Our talk of seeing the spider was not good luck in the house.
Crying and roaring her potty.
There was no leftover.
There was a moment when the spider had to be commanded, in the interest of the daughter's developmental shift.
It's left to me.
He was caught in a glass and banished across the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but after such a long time of coexistence, I still felt ugly, as if I was throwing a relative out.
We assumed that the fishes would start to appear more often and begin to multiply with a geometric series.
The world wonders, a week, two, none of us have appeared there.
I started speculating about the cause.
I wondered if the spider had grown them there after the ants, that the environment of the toilet was not as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were already teeming again.
I had to come up with a different theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured that their attachment to the spider must have been the reason that if they didn't see it, that it was hidden in some other place, and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator, and his rapid disappearance caused some kind of alarm reaction.
I have no illusions about their eyes.
There was some shy light, but that they would react to hand-waving or fast movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
All that's left is to attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wish to the ether, and I hope they didn't give up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the Cyclone B.
The Ten Statements of Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
The statements of the genius scientist from the last century will probably never cease to fascinate humanity.
He was able to dive so deeply into everything that the figment was always a stunning finding.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
It has become known to people primarily for its special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
It is also impossible to forget its clarification of the photo-effect or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complex for many that for closer acquaintances it prefers to choose easy adjustments.
However, it is not easy.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: A watch near your beloved seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing these ten from his whole variety of famous quotes, which literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius tries not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of attempt can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one who can prove at any time that I was wrong.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the disorder in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what the fight will be in World War III, but in the fourth one it will be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to handle a problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive myself not to give Einstein’s formula on the definition of success: Taking A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest, and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are expecting changes for 1.5 billion.
"It is a success considering that all four of them are in the black numbers all this year," said Stanislav Mišák, the governor.
The total profit of regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher reimbursements from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
This fact also shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, constructions are coming together, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period when we mainly bought the devices was over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, top health care cannot be done, the regional deputy for health care Lubomír Nečas justified the plans.
He is looking forward to the changes in all hospitals.
The builders will be coming to hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, they are now selecting suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
They have a planned extension of dialysis in Kroměříž.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new intern to the open central pavilion for about 200 million.
And the hospital in Bata in Zlín is waiting for the long-delayed construction of a new central income and an intern, which will take three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the fundamental and often biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," said Věra Prousková, the director of the hospital, for example, about the construction of the Vsetín intern.
The five-storey building is supposed to be finished there in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for intern and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
The changes, which are especially familiar with patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, on the floor they have only one toilet, the beds are unpositionable, the windows are leaky, and the paramedics do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our intern was built thirty-five years ago and now it is on the edge of its life," said Pavel Calábek, director of the Zlín hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with an urgent reception.
Doctors and patients will have all acute wards in one place, in addition to new premises.
The same model already has half finished Uherské Hradiště.
Central income is already standing and within three years will be added to it by the intern.
"We will pay the construction from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained the director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding in the county.
The profit is still the highest and did not make it to the loss two years ago, when, for example, the Zlín hospital faced a loss of almost two hundred million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase income and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Patients of the Kroměříž hospital will also be improved.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go into repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the detention station will be completed, then the extension of the dialysis will begin, or the construction of the building for a new magnetic resonance imaging.

No one has explained to me how I should keep the accepted refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
After talks with his European colleagues, Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains that other states are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but reject any discussion.
He also points out that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live in our country anyway.
"We did not receive the answer and that is why we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you came up with at the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have some visions, they're going somewhere, they've got some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not get a response and therefore we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year now and saying this is the way.
But saying the quotas will solve everything?
We've been dealing with forty thousand not long ago, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross over us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, are gaining asylum in our country, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees don't really want to come to us, but we've already committed to accept fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more of them in this way?
We are committed to accepting 1500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even with the 1500, the point is that there will be 1100 people with whom we will deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come into our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we did with the ones we've captured.
It is a big question, and we will debate this with Europe whether we can detain the people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe treats it in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it may happen that even the 1100 will not be kept in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will leave for Germany again.
If we can detain them during the asylum procedure, we will handle the asylum procedure with them.
If it is Syria’s citizens, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of them are internationally protected, according to European statistics.
They will then be given documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will be resettled.
This is the second project that is still underway, and there we have only progressed in discussing with the churches the possibility that they could help them get employment, accommodation and so on.
But that's a run for a very long haul.
You said that at the ministerial meeting with us, the other states were not willing to discuss.
But isn’t it that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but does it not offer any solidarity step to unblock the discussion?
What exactly do you think this is a solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany says that all migrants from Syria can go to them, the news spreads in hours throughout all the camps around Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another migration wave that is going to Germany because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - simply to deter those migration waves, to help those in need, and to separate economic migrants.
Clearly let them know they don't stand a chance.
In the last year alone, fifty thousand Kosovons came to Germany.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's offices.
If we could separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of economies, the fifty percent of what social systems spend on them today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
It's now eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far is it to go to make border controls even tighter?
We were afraid of being caught in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we hold back will be returning Austria within seven days.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely unnecessary story.
So where is the breaking point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days exhaust our capacities so much that crisis plans will come in.
Then I agree with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an emergency government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation arises, the government can meet de facto immediately and by one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police for the army, let us give it a customs administration, or a prison service.
The extreme option is a state of emergency, which has now been declared by Hungary in some places?
I don't think we can get this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have a Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be very marginally affected, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debt at the last minute.
It tries to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid the debts.
Footballers also raised their money.
Football's Slavia stood trial on Tuesday for the first time over insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after the proposal was filed for it by Online Services from the Pacific Samoa.
Slavia’s lawyer, Zuzana Mládková, tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
It must be said that she had the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavia became the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, money has arrived at the club from the new owners, at the last minute.
This is evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vršovice club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, sent tens of millions of crowns owed.
"Everything was paid between 9/11 and September 15," attorney Slavie Mládková said.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Mario Lička.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexander Losenick.
Already on Friday, the club also paid the owed fees of the Prague 10 district.
The insolvency dispute thus remains de facto only claims that Slavie contradicts.
Either according to the club, the obligations did not arise at all, or they were litigated.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount if we lose these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can prove by an account statement," Mládková told the judge.
"Everything that has been overdue is paid," Mládková said, adding that the outstanding or contradictory liabilities were not paid.
It is also certain that the judge will not decide in the next few days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the aforementioned debts.
Subsequently, all the evidence will be evaluated.
Decisions can therefore be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the hearing to resume on the third of November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.
A medal for Finns and Austrians.

It is this year's novelty that premiered in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these honors because they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers boast similar systems, but due to the difference in software and in the control of parameters, the FastMig X is one of the world's top.
For those interested, delivery times are also pleasant, which are around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will definitely expand after the Brno trade fair.
We have been its regular participants for more than twenty years and almost always after it our business results are better than before, emphasizes Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka could be built in such a way that he did not fall through.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the firm that designed the tunnel.
Blanka could have been minted more safely, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there would be no two soil collapses in Prague’s Stromovka, according to the production director of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovič.
He said this Wednesday evening during a journalist's search of the tunnel.
But according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
It will open to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a trade-off between price and security.
"The tunnel could have been minted more safely, but the costs are rising exponentially," Butovich said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to be minted by a safer and more cautious method.
"If those measures had been applied 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovich said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was established in Stromovka, in 2010 the soil collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav CEO Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
According to the original intention, the construction was supposed to cost 17 billion crowns.
Adding to that the VAT that has jumped twice in the construction period, you have twenty-one out of seventeen billion.
Adding to this technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valorizations and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from those 37, Bělohlav said
Someone ordered that and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with a new Apple update
The new operating system can be requested in Settings when you click on the "General" tab and choose "Software Update" (update software).
When ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and then install it.

FedEx profits mixed, fiscal outlook cut for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in full-year profit forecasts due to low demand for freight and higher cost for the ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
In that period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings of between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, a drop of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an average interest rate hike of 4.9 percent, which will be reflected in January. 4, and higher surcharges for the land transport of heavy or large parcels that begin in November.
The company said it still expects earnings to grow compared to the previous year because of cost cuts, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, chairman and CEO, said the company was "showing solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
Holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same as they hired last year.
In a quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx acquired $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenues in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results of FedEx's ground unit.
In the last quarter, ground revenues rose 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher incomes because of higher base rates, while profits fell in the freight trade because of higher labor prices.
In pre-market trading about an hour before the opening, FedEx's shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent a year and 17 percent below the record of 11. June.
At his most anticipated session in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week sitting at the 27-foot-long Honduran Mahogany Table, deciding whether, after nearly a decade, the time has come to raise the key interest rate.
Towering above them at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-storey meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And that third term could be an X-factor in too close to the foreseeable decision to be announced on Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to run when weaned from an unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since late 2008.
Although most data shows solid growth in the economy, recent turbulence in global financial markets could already scare the cautious Fed because of adding to the volatility by raising its federal fund reference rate - even no more than by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Clearly, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch in the first place," Lindsey M said. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for a pretext to not raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already giving them sufficient justification to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in financial markets.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% of the chances of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates only if politicians soften the slump by promising that a further increase is in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed politicians would delay rates this week calmly, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed now raises rates," he states.
If the Fed politicians did, "they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold hands on the financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that raising rates would appease financial markets because it would remove uncertainty from how the Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be well on its way to a 0.25 percentage point increase in the rate this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects a rate hike this year through spring and early summer despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labor market saw solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of lift.
And although inflation continues to run below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed politicians say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to sweep late last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones' industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record high in May, when investors feared that China's slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market has somewhat rebounded this month and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of the May high.
To the Fed's policymakers, the unfair market situation adds a comprehensive calculus to start raising the interest rate.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," Stephen D said. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
They now predict they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about the impact this is going to have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the entire world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
A mere hint of then-President Ben S. Bernanke's in 2013 that the Fed could "spur" their monetary expansion in the market has triggered cramps around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to be able to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated with movements in financial markets that appear incoherent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Markets Committee's policymaking committee, pushed for a rate hike, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points during three sessions "Despite the limited identifiable impact on growth in the U.S.," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should prioritize concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the committee setting rates at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil is not even close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets have gotten angry," said Posen, president of the Institute for International Economics, Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood and not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/warehouse is the only point of contact that offers a stunning array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part available if you need a little bit of engine oil.
The store is massive and will take you over an hour to climb all the aisles.
If you're hungry about all this shopping, go for a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trade stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various sampling points.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
The limit of fresh produce belongs to special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
The spread of meat is large, for example, fish - the employees behind the counter will wash and excrete you, even fry it for you, if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezing compartment, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter watermelon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter blanks and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
The wide streets meet shopping trolleys and forklifts.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is located: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounds the suburbs of Chinatown and the center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Speed on the highways will remain the same.
The acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways, it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed limit up to 150 km/h under favorable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided when it acceded to an amendment to the Senate, which rejected the speed increase.
The amendment to the Roads Act will now go to the president.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto the law allowing a hundred and fifty-kilometre speed.
Transport Minister Dan Ťok (for ANO) was also opposed to the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such a speed.
Ťok on Tuesday backed the Senate version of the bill before MPs.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane ones.
The Chamber of Deputies first extended this possibility to highways, on which it could be driven in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
The MPs have now accepted his proposal.
Senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also removed the authorization of the traffic police to have the last say in the regulation of local roads, which are taken care of by municipalities.
The Senate version, which was approved by the House, also provides that sewerage, water or public lighting cables can be stored longitudinally under the road surface.
Municipalities would save money on land purchases.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and facilitate the management of towed vehicles for municipalities, to which owners do not subscribe.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles, which their owners will not apply for within a six-month period after the towing notice.
Municipalities will have the possibility to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory on the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of a fine even for forwarding companies.
The amendment also abolishes the possibility of introducing electronic motorway signs instead of existing paper stamps, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The Ústí ex-prime minister is on trial.
He faces 10 years for overpriced welcoming of his people.
The case relates to the allegedly overpriced project of welcoming people.
The police also wanted to prosecute MP Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the state prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused at least one million crowns in damages, according to the indictment.
The applicant is based on an expert opinion.
The former members of the city's management, according to the prosecutor, by virtue of their office, unlawfully allowed to obtain the property benefit of the company that organized the welcoming of the citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandik ordered the then head of the Municipal Department of Urban Services, Education and Culture to address five interconnected companies in the selection process.
When another company entered the competition, which offered the lowest price, the town hall canceled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator by the city and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the City Council.
The city paid out at least a million extra.
Both accused aimed at securing the award of a public contract for the Darothore company to organize the Welcome of Citizens event in Ústí nad Labem for a long time and in a coordinated manner, have acted at least in violation of the requirement to proceed with the care of a proper manager, writes the prosecutor.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that after obtaining this contract, Darothore will subsequently charge Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome Citizens event, which will be disproportionately increased compared to the fair value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
In the end, the city paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was overpriced by at least one million crowns.
Mandik has previously denied any violations of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I do not understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, adding that the city under his leadership only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was attended by Roxy II.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money," Mandik added.
The criminals originally wanted to charge MP Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not release it for prosecution.
The criminals therefore postponed the case in her case, but they expect to charge Kail after her parliamentary mandate expires.
The welcoming of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift cheque for 5 thousand crowns to buy children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police allegedly let a dog into the refugee.
Then they made the reporter delete the footage.
The Hungarian police are said to have briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete footage of a police dog allegedly knocking a refugee to the ground.
The Hungarian government disputes the accusation.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke crossing the border with Serbia.
Police intervened against the refugees and one of them had a certain Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," he lay, Muzi claims.
One of the police officers noticed that Muzi was filming everything and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call either his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Police took Muzi to a dark place at the refugee registration centre and asked him to show them what he was loaded to.
Then they ordered him to delete the footage.
The museum thus lost the result of two days of work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The Associated Press sent a letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She called the police's behavior unacceptable in it and said journalists should be allowed to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to worry about the government destroying legally obtained material.
Kovács, citing the police report of Muzi's account of events, disputed.
He said officers just wanted a journalist to show them if they were in some of the footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to lubricate anything.
"Dogs can bark - they are trained to deter and a little scared, but they do not attack with certainty," Kovács said.
The unpredictable Champions League.
Winning at City kicks us in, Juventus believe
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," Manuel Pellegrini, the home City coach, shook his head.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team has created much opportunity, but we've had the ball on the cleats longer.
"The cause of the defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team scored in a competitive match after a long 636 minutes.
The finalist of last season, Juventus, was on the opposite before the encounter - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he has only a point as a defending champion and with a score of 2:4 is located in the 16th place of the table.
That's why the turnaround at the Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports before the new year - Pirlo, Tévez and Vidala.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Manchukiq and Morata.
"It's true, this victory is terribly important, hopefully thanks to him we will hit the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the attacking phase.
My players deserve this result.
"Before our equalization goal, we could have scored 0:2, but Gianluigi supported us," said Allegri goalkeeper Buffon.
"We burned some good chances," regretted Yayu Touré, City's midfielder.
We have to take experience from the Champions League and try for a better result next time.
Goodbye Angelo, Goodbye Old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should remember that the whole media crazing around is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, the newspapers and the media are full of children who carry their parents on their hands after the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this automatically evokes a sense of guilt and compassion in a person - that is, in a European man.
Well, it's not just the desperate children coming here, notice in the footage of the landing boats to the Greek islands that the children are not so visible on them!
Well, somehow, pictures of ships heading to Lampedusa, refugees from the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenade is surrounded by thousands of young men, have disappeared from our television.
For the most part, young blacks.
And the pictures from Callais have also disappeared, where these dark-sized men are waiting to see if they can climb through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's touching it anymore.
Even those pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans somehow did not make a special impression on the people of Europe.
There was too much falsehood about it.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it somehow hides that it's not just about unhappy children from Syria, but also about the stalled - for the elderly: fashionably handsome - young men.
Whose musculatures look like they've just come out of a fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
No matter that she was private, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no hams.
And young blacks came out of them.
About thirty men and five women.
Between 15 and 30 years old.
They walked into the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes. In the hands, of course, the smartphones.
They were not interested in the fact that it was a private beach, and the staff - the Turks, the Muslims! - were clearly afraid of them.
They occupied all the deck chairs.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was in the sea was out of luck.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On the heads of the cap with a nail, white and colorful adidas on the legs.
Then they laid siege to the local beach bar and began feasting.
They occupied the tables around, stuffing themselves next to the sitting dark and white guests of the bar - reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace somewhere calm.
Incoming black people drank beer straight out of thirds - like in a series from the US?! - on the beach throwing empty bottles around.
They were always screaming loudly at each other.
It was not English, however.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies - screaming and screaming in the water, mothers with children and pensioners ran away in horror, and in half an hour there was not a single non-black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They all disappeared.
Whether or not he was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in the evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," the waiter said.
I remembered: "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a massive gold cross on his neck, like, twenty-centimeters.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are they drug traffickers?" I asked.
"You saw them drinking," the waiter replied.
They don't smuggle or use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I knew what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2005 it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what was coming next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they don't know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at the time.
And they go and go and go.
Today it has become clear that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as intellectuals and linked to them, lobbying and economically important groups have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now a publicly recognised main force in Europe - are lying, lying and lying - but not only them, also the EU's and the television leaders, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of images of Moscow television from August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunbathers at the station, but most of all - the ancient Germans - Muslims welcomed their fellow soldiers.
For weeks, they have been babbling on the news on Czech Television, how, according to some research, Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
But who has only been in Germany for a few days knows that it is a lie like a tower.
This is confirmed by further information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organized by the ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our televisions melded.
However, they concealed what broke in Germany the next day: that in the poll of the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans do not want any more immigrants - 67 000 people participated in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly declared in November 2010, five years ago, saying: "Our pursuit of a 'multi-cult' society has totally failed."
She said: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts to such coexistence have completely failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she said, the strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating themselves has proven successful. Today they live here with us and we have been lying to each other for a while that they will not stay, that one day they will disappear again.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, when we tell ourselves that we simply live happily next to each other, has failed this approach.
He totally failed.
But even Merkel probably doesn't have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
Conflict is increasing rapidly.
The German Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, the MP for the SPD, the only one who reportedly does not even have a high school diploma in the European Parliament - yes, that is the one that Berlusconi said in the EU parliament could play a concentration camp from a minute on - has already been demonstrated more than once.
It seems, especially under the impression of the last statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of countries that have been victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have tried for years, at least on the outside, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence be sown in the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped the Great Germans' attempts to control the entire centre of Europe with all his might?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he should have.
When they shut it down, preparations for World War 1 began.
The idea of the Greater Germans, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After the attempt of the Marxists to control the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraction, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis of, for example, ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism.
We'd say sun.
The German elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, so they left alone all those anti-atom fighters, enthusiasts looking for paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our Forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who want to do something differently and better everywhere in the world, they have fully sided with the fighters against heating the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - in this stream, and the anti-Slavic current, which considers all Slavs a difficult vermin - has been a German nationalist since the days of Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements of Schulz and the German ministers openly threatening disobedient Eastern states, the idea of a leadership Germany show.
Which must be listened to without question.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we add that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind this, as always, is the capital, especially the German one, which suits and which is based on the fact that Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through banks and the Union.
The pseudo-sunbathing of the sunbathers first led the Germans into the swamps of environmentalism and multiculturalism, and today brought them home and will bring perhaps millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the voices of the sirens, soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and start rebelling.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors again by force, again part of its inhabitants - but it seems, an increasingly small part - can ideologically infatuate, but in the end, reality, as always, catches up with it.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are already on fire.
What will the German government do when the Germans’ public protests against the incoming Islamists break out?
Who will the Muslims, who have long been living in Germany, come to the rescue, but certainly not the assimilated to take over the local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, the incoming Islamists and the Germans, watching with fear the Islamization of their country, do?
What will this do to the Germans, and with Germany, when the people who will loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-superman Muslim will rise?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that has provoked the support of the sun-industry ideology in Europe, that is, the ideology of the elitist and essentially totalitarian, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the blunt behaviour towards disobedient democratic Germans and all inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, it cannot go well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of nosy vendors: to scare them to death.
Just knock and the robust knocker will fall on you in a way that the weaker nature may not just stand.
The living head will wipe you away and drive you away even hard, on the way away will accompany (or rather drive away) an insistent seller and a living statue.
Perhaps it is a pity that a talking knocker cannot be bought in reality.
Even in our country, it would be useful to chase away a lot of peeks and scumbags.
Oxalis corniculata.
A small weed that tolerates dry environments.
And so it is located among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that belongs to the expansion weeds, but looks like a nice impression in terms of flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
She's erratic, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, is easily adaptable, modest and unpretentious.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worthwhile to observe and photograph it.
Under the microsight of the detail there is the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian pediatrics company Rio Grande promotes healthy diet while breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatrics company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the knowledge of the importance of a good diet while breastfeeding using pictures of children sucking from their breasts painted by displaying unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that supply infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Due to the excessive energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually impacted the genetic production of their children and protected them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diets have also been confirmed to have negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rates, though Nine's attempts to take the lead on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's flight to Canberra to cover the cost of the Liberal leadership leak failed to create a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
The morning show Nine screened from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that this tyranny of distance matters to the viewers of Aussie TV so much, because it recorded an average of 397 000 viewers in five capitals compared to 330 000 viewers of Today broadcasts.
Today saw a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was only after last Thursday (343 000).
Today in recent months has filled the gap on Sunrise.
In August, there was an average of 318 000 in Today, compared with 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40 000 and 50 000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 viewers and a Today 314 000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened in the whole morning.
The winds of change affect more this morning than just parliament, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was a stunning debut of 800 words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could have pulled off a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night's statement is a clear "yes."
The X Factor from Seven retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, smoothly defeating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30), which was presented by Andrew O'Keefe' had an average of 446 000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623 000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520 000 spectators and the second half a whopping 720 000.
The hot Seat had an average of 620 000.
Thanks to a drop in The Chase Australia's second-night assessment, Nine will be confident that the Hot Seat will eventually win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute show, which failed to beat McGuire's show.
Originally published as Sunrise dominates, while Today remains local
Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect kid - but who will he choose?
Secrets revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally found out who would win the Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor with is shrouded in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who will remain standing will definitely not reveal who is the right one, who will eventually get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they were just two left, they inadvertently told us who was going to win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday's final
All three women lyrically praised why Wood is the perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, which one gets Wood's final flower?" their answers could act as a spoiler about who would win the heart of the Bachelor.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would best fit Wood in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a light relationship since a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They feel good and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks he and Sam Wood could make a fine couple.
For her, she claims that during his last visits home, she realized that Wood could be "the right one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a game anymore - I opened my whole heart to it now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls anyway - it's between Snezen and Lana indecisively.
Bachalor is aired Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams questioned after his great start of practice at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was done by a convert from the Australian Rugbio League on the first kick-off from a pitch at Tuesday's 20:3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him in the game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula was also still honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing the rookies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also backed Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, declared that Hayne had also been given encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only care about the next game.
In the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for on his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing when he left the field after an error and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his career in the NFL, he couldn't even imagine.
"That's what happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007 when a record in his own goal-line territory led to Queensland's three.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin meet in discussion on gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested while pointing pistols on a Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts limited.
The ÚS defended the emigrants who sought compensation for the property.
The pair emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the pair turned to the state with a request for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The court first awarded them the required amount, i.e. more than 2.8 million crowns, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim by granting them only less than 90 thousand crowns, referring to the fact that the amount of the compensation is determined according to the price regulations of 1991.
The Supreme Court defended the immigrants and initially tapped the defendant's amount.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned with a complaint to the ÚS.
In the meantime, there was such a change in social and economic circumstances that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at that time - even if it represented a compensation adequate in relation to the removed property - today reaches only a fractional amount of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of secondary participants as a restitution of authorized persons who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to obtain compensation before," explained the judge's rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, explaining why the ÚS sided with the emigrants.
"The Office has repeatedly expressed its support for the general courts to proceed in restitution cases so that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation, i.e. the atonement of property wrongs caused by acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved," the judge added.
Evita will now be played by Radka Fišarová in the musical Studio DVA.
Radka Fišarová, by the way, became the world’s youngest Evita when, in 1998, at the age of twenty, she portrayed the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perónová in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spiral Theatre in Prague.
To return to the same role, he says: "To this day, the difficulty of Evita has not been much matched by the performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended for the role of the first lady of Argentina by Monica Absolon.
I've seen Monch three times in Evita and it's definitely been inspirational for me.
Here I suddenly saw a completely new concept.
I am quite a supporter of more modern modifications, but this one is just especially good.
"The director of Ondřej Sokol is original, light and contemporary," says Fišarová.
The musical sceptre between the two singers will be handed over at the Monika Absolonová Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 p.m. at the Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening will culminate in compositions from the musical Evita.
The experience will certainly include a duet of Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also leave the director’s desk when he will be represented during the filming of Karel Roden’s film in the role of President Perón.
Due to public interest, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Directed by Ondřej Sokol, the main female role was originally played by Monika Absolonová.
At her side, Karel Roden appears as President of Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
Legendary songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovský are performed by a live orchestra under the direction of Kryštof Mark, who participated in the first performance at the Spirála Theatre.
4 people killed after officers fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters against a proposal for a new state constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district officer, reports that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station and some threw rocks and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal reports that police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, according to the report.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the last of a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new province under the proposed new constitution, and has tempered their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent encounters, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been going on since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the trial after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted in Kathmandu this week on the provision of the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We're certainly not allowed to panic right now.
After losing on the ice of the championship Litvínov you did not even manage a home duel with hockey players Sparta (3:5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly disastrous entry into the extraleague as a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.

The NHC predicts a 60 percent probability of cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a probability of 60 percent in the emergence of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of developing a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, a Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it was launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who flooded European states in fleeing war-torn and poor countries. Each selected amount is doubled by Google.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
The news was posted on her blog by Google employee Rita Masoud based on her personal experience when she fled Kabul as a seven-year-old with her family.
“We have traveled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like mines are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among 4 non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Emergency Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will double all posts made through google.com/refugeerelief to a height of $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since the Second World War. Most of them come from Syria, torn by a four-year war that has driven up to 4 million people this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data lasts a long time to display," Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on JAMA's new study of surgery.
Surgeries for weight loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric operations have proven effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the weight relationship relative to height, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or higher indicate overweight of a person, and people with a value above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in treatments for type 3 diabetes in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved entirely in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the drug-treated group, only 1 percent was completely resolved for diabetes comparison, and in part only in about 2 percent of patients.
Furthermore, control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol was also demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's level of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, according to researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the drug-treated group, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c - has not reduced the death rate at five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the group with bypass lost more weight compared to the group of gastrectomy (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater BMI declines (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent) and were more likely to remise diabetes (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to life prolongation, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent greater chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study has not shown an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, this is a reassuring outcome for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here, this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he states.
Blackstone also further argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after a decrease in the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long with the fact that we're showing people the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once the build-up of these genetic changes that will firmly connect their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan leader of the Buddhists has called for an end to the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the ethics study, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under the current circumstances, the interest of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to address the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We have to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, arguing that "the violent response of the U.S. has sparked a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested a sanitation agent in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported nearly 400 percent growth since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to a toxicology center in Georgia.
According To Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the sanitation remedy deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on Youtube show teens drinking sanitation because of cheap fuss.
The teenagers allegedly mixed a seaning agent with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive scent of the remedy.
"Children don't think it could hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot of more attractive (sanitation) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitation products with the smell of strawberry, grapefruit or orange, which are very tempting for children.
The sanitation contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several elbows can mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," Dr., the medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital's control toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't just let a glass of whiskey lay around, but people leave these sanitation supplies outside, and when children get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested up to four sips of a sanitation agent at school with the smell of strawberry and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who looked after her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke indistinct words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell because of alcohol and hit her head, according to Ritchey.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been deadly to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitation to be out of the reach of children.
Outside of alcohol poisoning, some sanitation equipment was associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitation device that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health professionals believed that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in North New York planned to poison their "evil" teacher by deploying antibacterial products around the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation equipment and has banned their presence in the room.
Police judged the thwarted plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
No inconsistency in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays talk of a discrepancy in Celtic, while Deila admits the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton are concerned that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The penalty from the first half by ADAM Rooney secured Aberdeena a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, giving the Dons a five-point lead between each other and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of discrepancy
That situation has triggered rumors of a discrepancy in Celtic that has been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his team-mates are not working under any pressure from increased oversight in preparing for a match with Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bored Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands representative Ronald de Boer claims Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no more rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently the ambassador of Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands, they don't show the best of Celtic matches anymore, and why?"
Because the Rangers are no longer there.
The people here don't just talk about the return of the Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Company.
He talks about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension at the Old Company's matches and not only the people of Scotland are watching these games.
I turn things back to good, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia admitted Celtic stumbled a little, but the Norwegian boss pledged to turn things back to the good.
The defeat by Malm and the subsequent drop out of the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now towers on top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic have already experienced bad periods and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about current events.
We're exactly the same - but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players much better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton worry about January reinforcements
Despite comments that emerged a few weeks ago and suggested he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers chief executive Mark Warburton is worried about big shopping reinforcements and insists he does not want to disrupt the team's unity from Ibrox.
The former Brentford boss states: "The January transfer window is very different from that of summer."
The players who come in the summer have a whole pre-season season to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer target suggests retirement
Swansea Michu, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, indicated he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old scorer has already had problems with his prone ankle for two years and has failed to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA over comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on that defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by referee Collum, who was recalled.
Neilson stands by his statement and states: "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths pledges to avoid Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place at a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh ahead of the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"This was a derby and it was a escalating moment," the striker said, continuing: "I can safely say I won't be returning to Tynecastle unless it's in the Celtic jersey."
Council in Tannadice confident in managing Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists the Dundee United board still believes in remedying the situation by the current management of the team - but admits the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the boys for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for a "ugly win" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen team had to stick desperately against Hamilton Accies to manage to get a seventh league victory in a row and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty from the first half by Adam Rooney.
McInnes states: "There is no team that has won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this type of matches."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged while overall UK unemployment rises
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remains unchanged at 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK has risen by 10 000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The 5.9 percent Scottish unemployment rate was above the UK rate (5.5 percent), as data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a period of three months, the number of workers now halved to 2 612 000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a number above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
David Mundell, Scotland's secretary of state, said in a commentary on the latest figures: "The long-term government plan laid the groundwork for a stronger economy."
It's been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has grown while unemployment has declined.
Why did I witness the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will be watching the man's death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the chamber of death of the Oklahom State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who will witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm starting to worry about it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way I can tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is being carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will follow the entire execution in a dispassionate way.
I can't do that.
I will sit alongside fellow friends of Richard Glossip and have created a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that kid.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The Prison Administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have articulated it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help procedures against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in a crime.
But I believe there is a good chance that he is innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that insufficient evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And it is from this perspective that I will be watching his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love, to die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he rescued the man from Canning River.
The bet of the Petrhu man that he would escape the police did not work out after he got into a shallow muddy water just metres from a police officer who tried to persuade him non-violently to return to shore.
Canning Vale police were called in an incident extending to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come get me,'" Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use safer tactics, and that's the police negotiation.'
"People sometimes try to do funny things while fleeing," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and try to cross the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the organizers tried to spy on him and threaten to end the races
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to end racing immediately.
He focused on the organizers and the Stability Department of Racing Victoria and was based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratches while maintaining on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin's positive swab on cobalt, which he could not explain.
He bit his tongue about espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it's going to come out of you all at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and getting a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped a bomb in his interview with racing.com that the integrity of the department had tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him employment in my stables for finding out information about the things that are being done in my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because in an attempt to catch me, they have completely failed me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, the current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and arrange for people outside coaching positions to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them material to think about.
But I've gotten to a point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will pressure them and carry a burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels increased with a long-term investigation over cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent scratches made him feel like he "could have his licence for hours on the table."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the rule of treatment on the day of the race "ridiculous" after a clay clay cladding or mud was applied to the horses' feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced three months of disqualification for treatment of the compress on the day of the race, on which the organizers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need the rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver who fled was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and drove off after a collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley's main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist drove off without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed himself to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in an accident, failing to provide assistance and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back from rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm coach, has criticised his players' interventions as "setting a plan" by two NRL favourites of the premiership.
Trent Robinson, the coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees had allowed Storm players to "wrest" his players during the controversial Storm team victory in the Sydney qualifier final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, the Brisbane Broncos coach, made a slightly veiled remark on Strorm after his team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "parade" of the rugby league and, according to him, two from Queensland were not "too big" to wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' interventions and said they were focused on "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that this situation has boosted his confidence because his team is being criticised by two leading coaches, which may mean they are afraid of defeat from the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our defensive system and techniques in the last year, the last few weeks we have only put an emphasis on contact during the procedures, and that has meant a turnaround for us.
Trent has been here for three years and he's obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how such things always come in this year's part.
Bellamy deactivated Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right in that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. She was just as exciting, too," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised for being a boring team and Wayne said at the time that he didn't really care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that seems cancelling to him, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
You would like to play football like this if you had this type of players.
He said that opinion in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It inspires more confidence in me because they say things like that because they're worried about the match against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that more goals fell in the Storm and Roosters match than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The game of the Broncos team was probably good, I didn't watch, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are the breaks and not scoring attempts that interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will definitely meet again at the stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man receives USD 200 000 bail for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life sentence for holding 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled out of Queensland got a bail of USD 200 000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which arrived from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted during a meeting with a jointly accused in the port during the morning and later met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for owning commercial quality cocaine, Maksimovice's lawyer based his defense on the fact that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he might have been in a cafe quite by accident and innocence.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed the Maksimovs would have fled.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He travels frequently to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the Crown Case, he lied to police about where he lived.
The mother and stepfather of Maksimovice jointly offered a bail of USD 200 000 for his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both persons, it is clear that the deposit of USD 200 000 is a real financial burden for them," Justice Flanagan said.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient because the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic has been granted bail on the condition that he surrenders both Australian and Serbian passports, reports daily to the police and will observe a curfew from 18 o'clock in the evening to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure paedophiles to send pictures
The paedophile used the eleven-year-old girl's phone to retrieve photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, then logged into hers at her online chat, where he had a lot of indecent photos of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found her phone missing and then found him in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it and found disturbing news before she alerted her mother.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then analytical computers found the address and discovered a "worrying" search on the web using terms for searching for naughty images of children.
Hogg then told police officers that his reason was to "guide the paedophiles" on the Internet before "he would pretend to be a police officer and scared them."
Fiscal Deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was doing the search on the computer, but claims he just wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare the paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them
He claims it skipped him while drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, he called his mother, shaking and crying.
She saw the naughty pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and spoke about how the defendant was using her computer and the Playstation so he could talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to bringing an action regarding the admission or provision of inappropriate images of children 14. June last year, violated the terms of the bail on January 25 and failed to appear at a hearing in court on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offender list because he can argue that there was "no essential sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed his sentence to October for filing reports to social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody before a hearing on the other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sex offenders before the date of his sentence.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers poor speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, had earlier this year fallen on the steps leading to the stage.
He was not injured, but a video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tainted by claims by opposition lawmakers that they received anonymous threats of killings that warned them against booing Mr Mugabe during his speech.
He was booed and provoked last month during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to obstruct Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that doesn't appear but is named 'death'," he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and, once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "fearing" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is preparing to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30 000.
Hewlett-Packard abolition of 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the cost of the company's business services.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating the PC and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, according to a statement from HP.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will be at the forefront of the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores that will help businesses transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will, after all, have a company's statement of annual revenue of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will lead to the layout of the company, founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed the "Birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to handle the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical firms in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a narrowly specialized firm has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that he is still only September, and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means Wilshere will surely miss at least another four English games and, from a history perspective, his involvement in the next summer European championship, is clearly uncertain.
The great pity of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back into former form during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger argues.
It's a wound that requires healing.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It did not concern his ankles or the injuries he had sustained before.
That could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger admitted there was a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
The poll conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. has recorded 23 different Wilsher injuries since he made his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played only in 65 league games for Arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for the Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, he has been one of two Premier League clubs that has lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in the area of recorded injuries over the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you’re coming back after an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal begin the campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, that is, Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to take on.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo also were not beaten in a total of 41 games after retaining a "unbeatable" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Richter on Wednesday night.
That was the 10th time in Zagreb this year.
Wenger thinks the Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco and remains far from the hope that he will lead the club to their first European Cup victory.
"This deployment is tremendous," Wenger argues.
It never happened to Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar depictions in various shows is blatant, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever in terms of suicides among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked the year 2015 as the Year of the Man, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies a friendship for the fulfillment of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured person had a high enough percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half chance of experiencing mental problems.
But in order for the friendship to work, of course, it must be achievable first.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, an immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful has doubled, even though we are rather isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game creator recently explained, money doesn't really buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was the source of that idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which glowed through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent sacrifice, the moment of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, although they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
How one Samaritan worker explained to me: ... "my role as a listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will come up in my memory when I try to offer a longer-term alignment mechanism.
It emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
As for my task, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater close friend, from a network of friends and family.
So if you are going to FrendsFest organized by Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or when you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and greet him.
You never know what the difference your friendship can make.
The Friends series will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored on his debut in the Champions League, helping PSG beat Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the message about the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmo at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his Champions League debut and this PSG player sent the French champions behind the win, but then they threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a goal with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore Team Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their journey to the quarter-finals they have recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not the classic performance of Laurent Blanco's team, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was prodigal in front of goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"In the Champions League, it's not easy to win outside or at home, so a 2-0 win makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in defence is a good start, although there are things we'll have to improve with the progress of the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't score one or two more wickets.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, who made a 2-2 draw at home this weekend with Bordeaux in League 1 but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked by both the man who would take PSG to a new level in Europe after the transfer from Manchester United, which took place last month, and showed why when he ran into Marc Verratti's pass behind the defence of Malmo and, with a beautiful finish, sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back into the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to kick-start a spectacular PSG victory, he had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the playoffs and made it to that stage, came on with 9 internationals in the starting lineup and five defenders and two overcast midfielders were a tough opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjice's shot, who only narrowly missed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves deprived themselves of the benefit of attacking with bad passes and a miserable finish that was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who failed to shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed as his shot arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half by Cavani.
However, he proved much more appropriate when it came to preparing chances for his team-mates and it was just from his pass that Di Maria sent a spinning shot that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan's header sent behind the line for the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic passed to him after a pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
This ended all Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could make anything out of the match, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from great close proximity thwarted David Luiz's hopes, and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of the alternating Ezequiel Lavezzi was unrecognised at the end of the match.
The Malmo Age Hareide team coach later admitted that PSG were a class higher than his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we've only played the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a stunning match for them.
Glencore has earned $2.5 billion for selling shares
The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which has been hit by a breakdown in commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares as part of its sweeping plan to reduce debt.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with commodity price tumbling as China's slowdown in the economy is reducing demand and sparking sparks of destruction across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore stock prices to the top in London's stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that a $2.5 billion share sale is part of broader plans to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, marking a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns over the prolongation of the brakes on Chinese growth have reduced the price of iron ore by almost half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Washington visits Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in Barack Obama's response to a visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will be held after the talks end.
"President Xi's visit represents an opportunity to consolidate mutual relations between the U.S. and China and encourages cooperation in resolving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the disagreements between the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York for the September U.N. meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious issues, including Washington's fears of China's alleged cyberespionage and its growing aggressiveness in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency flare detonated by Germany has far from melted the European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, French daily Le Figaro wrote.
On Monday, the European Union decided to deal first with the problem of refugees: it will rather systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they set foot on the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing over the future distribution of refugees by quota based on the amount that is increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160 thousand refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States changed their priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter out those who arrive already today and resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Efficient management of the EU's external borders is essential for coping with migration," the text discussed by ministers said in Brussels on Monday.
After the common currency crisis, the EU finds itself in danger in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its resolve and increasing pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in that country.
The central power makes it clear that without it, no free movement in Europe is possible.
The evidence was that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering it, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has done this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
But he also sees the blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is solidified.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of new arrivals have already been registered and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that there will be no camps on its shoulders in which refugees would accumulate on its account.
The real black hole remains Greece.
More than 200 thousand people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as recently arriving in Italy.
Most are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial disruption and waiting for a new government, has folded its hands into its lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and a source of now common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The Juncker Commission promises to introduce the checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on the front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the intervention teams of the European Border Control Agency Frontex in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen surveillance of the islands.
"Reasonable financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From the point of view of the law, Athens will continue to have the final say.
The question of the emergence of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching this.
The new emergency of the twenty-eights has pushed the issue of binding quotas and 160 thousand refugees, which was established earlier this year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament, and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the reallocation of 40 thousand refugees over the next two years, which has already been reached in June during a hectic EU summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, of which three are reportedly Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the German nationality is also a woman who was the only one of the affected eight-member group to survive.
Previous media reports said it was Polk.
A thirty-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury in the thigh bone area.
The dead were mostly forty, according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over, the bodies of the victims have also been taken to Briancon for identification," said Pierre Besnard, the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident happened around noon in the mountainous region of Pelvoux under the summit of Mount Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 metres wide and about a meter high," said Nicolas Colombani, the chief of rescue.
According to him, a huge amount of snow was rushed to the eight-member group at a height of about 3900 meters.
Today, the weather service did not warn of bad weather in the area.
Trpišovský before the game with Braga: Finally the right Europe.
During his debut in the cups, coach Jindřich Trpišovský managed to go through the Europa League preliminary rounds with the Liberec footballers in the basic group and is now looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
At the beginning of the main stage of the competition, Slovan welcomes the finalist from 2011 Braga and, according to the coach, wants to impose her playing style.
After all the nerves in the knockout battles, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal we've scored, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by just a doubles match.
"I'm very much looking forward to it and it's a true Europe, before it was just a qualifying," Trpišovský said at a press conference.
Braga considers a top team.
He will be very active, they have all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent may be harder even because he does not have such a name, but in his squad he has a player who I think has scored three goals for Manchester.
"It's an excellent whole at the level of the top teams," said Trpišovský.
He does not consider Braga to be a clear favorite.
I take it we play at home, so we're certainly not outsiders.
"I think we have shown that we are strong in our stadium even in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from eleven duels this season.
He believes that Liberec can also impose his style on Braze.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is unusually disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 layout with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"He's a very tough opponent, we've discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the pitch," Trpišovský said.
We studied our opponents a lot in the preliminary rounds, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have also adapted to training.
"And we definitely want to, although it will be very challenging to play according to our notes," the coach added.
Student films dominate Písek, international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries have entered their works in the competition of the 15th International Student Film Festival in Písek this year.
Four dozen of them, which the committee of students and teachers sent to the finals, will be screened from 15 to 18. October in the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said Jakub Charvát, a spokesman for the festival.
Every year, the festival has its own special theme, which is based on the festival jingle.
This year, she's a detective.
The director of this year’s gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And, of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student productions - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be judged by an international jury, which will include the winner of last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The organizers of the festival, as every year, prepare an accompanying program.
The Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbochanson band We're Flying?, the playful band Zrní or Petra Hapková with the recital Life on the Bar will come.
The festival will also host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first will be brought by a graduate of the Písek Film School and the winner of prestigious awards, including World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrennerová.
The second exhibition will bring closer the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The cameraman and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech will come to the discussion with the visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the natives of Brukner, Novotný and Hlach will christen their new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Both our school and festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to gather here, exchange experiences with each other and develop joint bonds and film craftsmanship," the spokesman said.
This will certainly be helped by the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, complete several job auditions at once and get a job position.
The festival is connected with the creation of the Private Higher Vocational School of Film in Písek.
Its founders, the couple Vladana and Miloň Terč, organized the first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth year.
In the event of bankruptcy of CK, insurance companies should pay the claims of clients in full.
Insurance companies should pay the claims of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
The decision was made on Wednesday by the House when it passed a modified amendment to the Tourism Business Terms Act.
Travel agencies will be able, according to a draft heading to the Senate for consideration, replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay claims of clients and above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the regulation, arguing for consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel agencies against the crash when the amendment is valid.
The proposal is also criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies have not paid full compensation are not euro-comform.
She drew attention to this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the right limit, Šlechtová pointed out.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be feasible," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-chairman of TOP 09.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to cease their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
Tomio Okamura (SPD), a member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, disagreed with Kalousek’s concerns based on a survey of the CK members.
"Stop showing us the lobbying of insurance companies," he said.
The statement of insurance companies does not make Okamura relevant, there is no official written statement to that effect.
However, they are looking into whether travel agencies will make complicity, which is not a problem, according to Okamura.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competing Association of Travel Agency of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of stairs to Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to arrange insurance.
"Consumer protection is working," Fischer said.
Her motion to launch the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not go to the committee because of the alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Philip drew attention to travel agencies, which he said could threaten consumers.
The rapporteur of the draft, Martina Berdychová (ANO), withdrew her proposal, in view of the verdict of the Constitutional Court, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance benefits would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not originally propose a minimum four-million-dollar insurance limit for travel agencies that offer air travel, and a million-dollar limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The border will remain at 30 percent of planned sales from the sale of tours.
However, the limit of the insurance payment will have to be such that in the event of the insolvency of the travel agency it will cover all claims of customers.
Even after the modifications, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to newly indicate which travel agency organizes the trip for the tours sold.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies, among other things, data on the management and number of tours before the conclusion of the contract.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also provides for further regular information to insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with daily data on the number of passengers and tours sold, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of deposits and sales for tours and vouchers for them.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfil any of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will invite it, according to the draft, to remedy it or it will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts in the event that the breach of duty could jeopardize the interests of customers.
The amendment is also intended to newly adjust the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which it will always submit until the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financial spending plan and a forward-looking outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, however, the lawmaker did not think about the situation, what will happen if the insurance company terminates the contract.
It will not be allowed to organize tours and clients who bought the trip before the termination of insurance will lose it according to the association.
In this case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good shape.
One of the options for how travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be the action against the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and in our market we will only act as agencies, said the association's vice-chairman, Jan Pope.
According to him, the draft amendment also contains the institute of the bank guarantee, but so unsophisticated that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot sound to an unlimited amount.
According to the association, the change in the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
In the light of the new EU directive, the whole law will have to be revised again in the next two years.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies are currently operating on the Czech market.
Only three CKs have ceased their activities this year.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth about twenty billion CZK per year.
Merkel: We must improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with German provincial prime ministers.
At the same time, she again appealed for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the member countries of the twenty-eight.
We need to help more the countries where refugees leave, or where they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will advocate for decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, the German chancellor said, according to which such a signal could be higher financial assistance or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organizations.
"The LÄN also supports the German government in promoting the fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis on European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, the country's prime minister, Dietmar Woidke, said at a press conference that he expected genuine solidarity from all EU states.
The Czech Republic has long rejected the distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke out in favour of speeding up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible whether they have a chance to stay here.
It is also needed for the authorities to be able to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the Brandenburg prime minister said.
According to him, most of the money that Germany spends on caring for refugees must be used precisely to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
More teachers will need to handle German.
It is a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees can be integrated, they can become an asset to us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity, claiming it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's episode of the Greenlight project's HBO project, the actor interrupted the cast in the Brown series as she highlighted the need for alternative perspectives regarding black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie and not at the cast of the show,” Damon said.
Shocked, Brown reacted in scandal with disbelief and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about the Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with joint well-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the outset.
The only black character who's a hooker who's being wrapped in a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People championed the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted that their directing "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the clip, "Matt Damon was jumping into the only black woman in the room, so she can explain to her that diversity is SO BIÁLÁ that it hurts."
The tweet has gained more than 5000 retweets and 4000 liques since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the death of teen Michael Brown by a white cop in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took national effect and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, the singer Prince made allusions to the movement while listing the nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent Black Lives Matter movement leader presented a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leaders said.
Damon was recently posted on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the pope for discussion on the depiction of the Catholic Church in the west.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.
“American Ninja Warrior has its first winner”
Professional climber and picker Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home one million dollars.
In the competition, which had just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the finals of this season, two men made it to the final round, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb on more than a 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first to climb within the limit, becoming the first contestant to overcome a debilitating 4 stretch in American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero overcame it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for the news! News right after his hard-earned victory and it was noticeable that he was still in shock from winning the top prize worth $1 million.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never earned more than 10,000 dollars a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to his win.
"So suddenly... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finals and why Britten won no reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who completes the track the fastest.
“If more competitors participate in the track, the one with the best time will win,” Weed said.
Although gaining the main win would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he has a grudge in him.
He is glad that he has achieved what he has accomplished.
He received a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.'
Geoff told me: "If there was to be someone who could have beaten me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue for the eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers only walked just past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the tigers from Detroit, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the rose garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are in the last place of the U.S. League's central division right now.
Only narrowly did the Tigers avert their defeat when they beat Minnessota in Tuesday's game with a tight 5-4 result at Target Field.
The twins missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros team and captivate the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was a return of the word to Z, which was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun, and it doesn’t matter how,” said Tiger manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive start and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings and then took the next in the sixth and ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 of the shots and 3 orbits.
It was his third game of his last nine games.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a match when you’re sitting on the bench often and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tigers batsman Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 circulations and his first withdrawn point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was his first three-point game since the last game of June, in which he hit four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He's got into it," Ausmus said.
"He looked good at training, he was noticeably better and he managed to bring it into the match."
Thanks to three rounds at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins got the best chance of getting back in the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton scored an inning thanks to two points on the left side of the pitch.
True fielder Aaron Hicks scored a point thanks to a set bat and Simon pulled out Brian Dozier before left-hander Blaine Hardy replaced him.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent, Mauer, and he had a batsman Miguel San in front of him, who blasted the ball and circled two bases, leaving behind right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With two players on the bases and a chance to draw in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send a third sweeper over two bases.
Plouffe has already won 27 runs through two bases this season and reigns in the league table.
Detroit retained a ninth inning, Mauer scored two downs and Bruce Rondon secured a score of 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander knocked out San for three overands.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes's game.
The Tigers gained three rounds in the first two shifts against a retired right-hand man who came into the game after a more than month break due to inflammation of the back muscles.
"I certainly didn't imagine a start like that," Hughes said, "but during the third inning I already felt I was better off."
After resisting the onslaught in the first inning, Hughes let one point to the other's baseman, Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the true fielder J.D. Martinez was brought out by Victor Martinez, who was the first to circle all the bases.
Victor Martinez interrupted his 0-21 series.
Third-placed Nick Castellanos followed him with a point to the right side of the pitch and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was overslapped when he tried to run to the third base.
The Tigers added in the second inning when pitcher James McCann and fielder Anthony Gose scored two and, consequently, one point, and a score of 3-0 on the final board.
"That got us to our knees," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won on the number of pitches, finished in the third inning without points and was replaced by right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three bases, earning six shots and 4 stretch marks.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' right pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
It will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who is on the injured list thanks to stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, is expected to feature in Wednesday's match.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-hander Daniel Norris, who will return after injury and take on the Twins.
From 30. June, when Norris was traded for left-back David Price, scores 1-1 after 4 games.
However, since August 20, he has not yet played because of a stretched muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third mutual game at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Minnesota's left-back Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) will face off against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA).
Xi calls for the economy to open up to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group whose job is Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," he said regarding the 16th session of the central head of the group on deepening overall reform.
Promoting the opening of the emerging reforms will add new impetus and vitality, it will also provide new space for economic growth, according to Xi.
The leading group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the loosening of border control policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The statement said a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and businesses that are outside the limits for investment.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
The move is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies, and will make sure that the firms themselves decide how to manage their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies that are funded from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," thanks to the optimization of requirements and simplifying the application process.
The provision of the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
New inpatient departments may be created in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the inpatient departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities to expand care in the region.
For example, in the department of surgical departments, one-day surgery could be created, where according to the set concept, surgical procedures that do not require hospitalization longer than 24 hours would be performed.
In which particular hospitals the workplaces focused on one-day surgery should be, it is not yet clear.
The skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital could create a laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the formation of an apalic center that would care for patients with brain involvement who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiology-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the hospital Ostrov, where similar care already exists.
Another inpatient capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region, are aftercare beds, especially beds of Long-Term Sick Care Centers (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should be closely connected to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should act as rehabilitation beds and part as classic LDN beds, recommends the concept.
As he points out, the aftercare beds are missing mainly in the hospital Karlovy Vary.
There, abandoned buildings could be used after centralization.
Last but not least, social health beds are absent in the Karlovy Vary Region with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
These beds are scarce throughout the country, so it could also serve for other regions as the so-called Alzheimer Center.
Hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, for which funds of European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will be connected to the fields of supespecialized care and will form a space for the translation of patients after the procedure, for example after cardiac surgery, neurosurgical, transplantation or other intervention," describes the regional concept of inpatient care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
