During an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend
While calling the emergency line in a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that they needed to come to their home.
Lamb resolved that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset, and that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and wish I could get it back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter, which authorities say was signed by Lamb, read.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to a school campus where police believe he shot and killed popular professor Ethan Schmidt in the doorway of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb is said to have made a fateful call to the emergency line shortly thereafter.
Finally came yet another death; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorized authorities are still trying to figure out Lamb's motivation.
The details released by state investigators as well as students and staff who knew him combined to create an image of a talented but likely troubled teacher.
Students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, thanking the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students took classes with both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations in terms of problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave, saying he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's recruitment meant that the doctorate that Lamb had worked would not guarantee him an automatic term to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb seemed to be bothered by something."
Lamb will not answer these questions.
After he left campus, police caught his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state border back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single shot from a pistol in the yard of a house about a mile from his parents in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington State Coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car started on the street.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb had gone to the house, though Johnson said he probably knew people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this county.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3500 students in a city of about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
In the spring, he received his doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was in high school with her friends, and he was the great older guy who taught her guitar for a few years.
He was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
The hearts of all the girls sparkled as soon as he appeared," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for some time.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the marriage record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to a branch of the River Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they split 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19.
"She was completely collapsed," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but he knew through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at a summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica to a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"They were just a happy couple," he said.
We bantered and recorded each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the slain professor, led the seminar in his first year and specialized in indigenous American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Boys' Student Club and Student Government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight commemoration.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended a vigil during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
School resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to the report.
This story has been edited to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made an emergency call after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but the maker of children's toys and products says it will give current and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will begin recruiting candidates this month and will hire employees through October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help out in stores and sales, for shipping and delivering goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana was going to be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
As the film begins, I realize I'm within reach of what could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back to the Future," featuring interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really for me without a doubt the best travel documentary ever made into a film."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's expedited military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict for nearly five years of conflict and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries — the US, Russia, China, Britain and France — on the sidelines of a ministerial session of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching an Iran nuclear deal in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 election numbers that show that Donald Trump in a real light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others dismissed it as a failed joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whether some Republicans try to drag Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they have failed (so far).
10 of the last 11 national polls show Donald Trump leading by double digits, and some are beginning to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership paved the way for Herman Cain's rise, and in the end, neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth realize Trump's will to endure and are beginning to dump their dollars in order to topple him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's approval rating has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers hold up in the early stages.
After last week's Quinnipiac University poll, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "happy" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two in 10 said they would be "outraged" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent said they would be "excited" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the company's favorite, Jeb Bush, became the nominee.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are in favor of the idea that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll Monday.
That number holds in the Iowa Senatorial Caucus, which is the first in the entire state where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to the ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have not had the brightest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Still, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some pundits point out that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always wins majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would have a wide 19-point lead over the trader in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they have already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters who support Trump say they won't change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that they would never change their mind.
46 percent say they keep the back door open for change between candidates.
Still, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 in 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech, immigration has remained the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump's bombast will lure key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will also stay.
Frustration with government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now receive about half of the support from Republican voters, largely because of their outlying status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry with Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with congressional Republicans, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "hellishly angry."
The House supported a larger share of the state's share of coal charges.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of yield from fees from open-cast brown coal mining from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that thanks to this, both the state treasury and municipal budgets would receive extra money.
The bill was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they do now, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget. In the first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which means, among other things, that the state should receive a larger part of the revenue from fees from open-cast brown coal mining from mining companies.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the method of calculating remuneration for minerals extracted by companies.
The change in fees for mineral extraction should bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, it should have a neutral impact on municipal budget revenues because the fee should be higher.
Last year, municipalities received about CZK 450 million from fees and the state budget CZK 150 million.
From brown coal mining, about 200 million crowns went to municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the payment for mining areas with permitted mining to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments is to continue to belong entirely to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that municipalities will receive CZK 14 million to 100 million annually instead of 14 million.
The amount of mining royalties will no longer be determined by law, but will be set by government regulation.
The remuneration is newly calculated as the product of the quantity of the extracted mineral and the rate for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned that setting the fee by government decree may not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax because the state charges for a mineral that is state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of underground coal mining, three-quarters of the money will go to municipalities and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money collected by the state in mining royalties will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The bill was criticized by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would harm municipalities affected by mining and regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the finance minister improve his budget," said David Kádner (Úsvit), elected in the Ústí region.
Communist Party MP Hana Aulicka warned against the rise in unemployment in the Most region.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because more than 90 percent of the prices are long-term contracted.
Major consumers, such as power stations or CHP plants, should therefore not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
In its view, however, the increase in charges is acceptable from the point of view of employment.
According to Milan Urban (ČSSD), the rapporteur on the amendment, it is crucial that deputies know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on coal mining limits, before approving the law.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the Czechoslovak Army mine should be made only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, economic and long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Veselý will lead the Czechs as the number one, the deployment will be influenced by the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board during Thursday's draw of the Davis Cup barrage in India, and this time each of them will probably intervene in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to distribute the load over the whole quartet due to the difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and humid is hot, so tough matches are expected, which can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take this into account.
I would like to spread it according to the weather.
And depending on how it will look, said Navratil during today's training of the Czech selection in the center of Raj Kumar Khánna.
With the number one of the team and the world number four Jiří Veselý, he counts on Friday and Sunday singles.
The number two position will probably be occupied by Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek.
I would like almost everyone to get involved.
"I'm slowly thinking about it, but I won't tell it yet," said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech team should be Stepanek's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It is only a question of who will stand next to the experienced doubles player, who has an 18-4 record in the Davis Cup doubles.
It probably won't be cheerful.
There are options with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
"I really don't know with whom and what it will look like," Navratil said.
He will decide according to the development of singles.
Pavlásek may be a variant, he and Veselý surprised in the 1st round with a win in doubles over the Australians.
"He's decent in doubles," Navratil said.
I did that against Australia and if I play I would like to do the same performance I showed from the second set.
"I'm happy for the experience and I'd like to score a point," Pavlásek said.
The home team will play Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he beat the third and fourth ranked players.
Number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164th).
Both of them are challenger players and ours have experience on the ATP Tour, but we have seen many times that rankings in the Davis Cup do not matter.
"The current form is decisive, the weather," Navratil said.
Friday's opening singles matches will start at 06:30 CEST and may be stretched due to the weather.
According to the forecast, it is supposed to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, it can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already lit it up and it's got some two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be possible to play it under the lights," Navratil said.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's PMQ debut has been eagerly awaited
New head Jeremy Corbyn will make his Prime Minister's Questions debut at a later date, and will be working with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after midday, while his performance is likely to be scrutinised by the media and MPs.
In a week-long statement, he called for "less theater and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip a few sessions he would leave for his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, following his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual TUC congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly while singing the national anthem on duty on Tuesday marking the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several front-page stories.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in respectful silence" and recognise "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and less than a sixth of parliamentary parties initially supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences in work are also "piling up" after Mr Corbyn's appointment despite his position in the European Union and the government's benefit limit.
Mr. Corbyl told the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had put forward amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a benefit cap.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, secretary of shadow labour and pensions, said the party had "very clearly" opposed the government's plans to lower the cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Workers' Party leader David Cameron has faced in the decade since his election as Conservative leader.
The Workers' Party leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from the crowd" for questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North says PMQs are too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "quick answers" and cog-trade, promising instead to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ when he does not attend — such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea of letting other colleagues speak for him from time to time, saying he had discussed the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics that was often associated with PMQ, but admitted years later that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House and their stance among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Photo shoot in Joburg": Homeless young people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn something and earn a living.
"I Was Photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their neighborhood to earn money.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of this project.

Pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The pound jumped the following data to show a recovery in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by SABMiller's bid target.
Between May and June, GB earnings including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest since 2009 and looked like estimates of when rates would rise were approaching.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market, jumping 20% after receiving a close bid from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, bringing brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch closer together.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures are beyond all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares at Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it rose $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest drop on the index, falling 4.3% after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating to a "sell" firm.
JD Sports rose 3.1% after sports firm reported an 83% jump in mid-year earnings before tax of £46.6m
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports executive chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh higher labor costs at his firm, he says.
Costs could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building are jubilant.
The controversial building was given a stopwatch.
The investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be illegal and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the building, which is to be built in close proximity to the Convent of St. Agnes in the center of Prague, in front of the Prague 1 office, and a petition was also created.
In its decision, the City Hall stated that the Building Act had been violated because not all the requirements of the zoning decision had been met.
"The zoning decision in question does not contain some particulars, such as the type of land, distances from neighboring buildings, a sufficiently clear and comprehensible description of the shape of the building, the definition of the area affected by the impact of the building," the decision reads.
The Magistrate also considers it illegal that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the originally discussed documentation, which has been changed.
For example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
The file material shows that the owner of the land only proved the consent to the project documentation for zoning proceedings, not the consent to the location of the building on his land, the Building Code Department writes.
According to Francesco Augusto Razetta from the investor company, the Building Code Department did not take into account the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry for Regional Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review has already passed.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmelon because of the allegedly proposed color of the façade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
In the past, hundreds of people gathered in the city center to protest against the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses are bothered by the fact that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the unsuitability of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Convent of St. Agnes.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the project from 2008, which counted with a glass façade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NPÚ) and in 2010 the permission of Prague heritage officers was revoked.
However, the new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by the National Heritage Institute and municipal heritage officers and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the design rejects the criticisms of opponents, saying that he never counted on the façade in pink, which gave the project its nickname after the pink-and-white sweet.
A Czech politician gave a ride to migrants.
The Hungarians put him and them in prison.
Berg traveled to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into a car, whom they allegedly wanted to drive about half a kilometer.
At that time, according to him, it was not yet a crime in Hungary, he told Lidové noviny.
We knew that law enforcement officers did not prosecute such conduct.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise they arrested us and took us to pre-trial detention in Szeged, he told the newspaper.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours in the cell.
The police officers allegedly behaved correctly, but communication was stalled because they did not speak English very well.
But the prison was pathetic, he said.
For example, in our cell measuring about three by four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were crammed in.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there the next day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them next, Berg said.

Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the Aldi onslaught in South and Western Australia.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are joining brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tastings in IGA stores, and shop owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on Sept. 29, when the food, liquor and hardware retailer celebrates its annual investor strategy day.
The stakes are high as South and Western Australia account for nearly 30 per cent of Metcash IGA business moves and generate higher revenue than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA stores enjoy much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in eastern states.
In any case, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will target 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores, which have taken over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in Western Australia over the next year, generating sales of USD 500 million and USD 600 million in each market.
Metcash's loss of food sales and volumes on Metcash's fixed price base could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax revenue, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that IGA shoppers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks Metcash food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the fund's senior manager, Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan financial group, said business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
But it is known that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the Metcash grocery store, which is supplied by about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational evolution of the speculative change as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesalers have gone on the counterattack and are investing more than $150 million annually to match rack prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers reequip stores by adding fast-growing food and news from private individuals.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says the price matching and refurbishment programmes will catch momentum and he hopes to get the wholesaler back to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a collateral damage in a recent uproar over his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often referred to as the "Special Ks," attracted unwelcome attention after an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a heated qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then declaring, "Wawrinka should have stretched one to Kyrgios, and I should have stretched one for him as well."
While he was last seen smashing a racket after a cramp derailed a possible beating of Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakis was adamantly defended by Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he will compete with Sam Groth for a second singles finish behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little bit involved in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He ruined his racket when he lost to a cramp in the US, but he's not the first player to vent his anger on his racket out of frustration. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say that he will not be proud of this event.
But really, he controlled himself very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he was treated a bit harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard and fits in well with the team and so on, he's never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in amazing shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for an important match that starts on Friday, saying the "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term fixture.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the game and not all the controversy that has built up around him," Healy said.
And I think Nick has risen very fast, as Federer, Murray and other people are pointing out, he is growing fast in the eyes of the public, he has also made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism that he is getting, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time away from the limelight when he can think about it.  In my opinion, he is the best solution for the team and also for himself.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
After announcing a state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to cross it illegally to stem the flow of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants piled into no man's land and Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
Those stranded for an unknown period of time on strips of land between two states stand those fleeing violence in their native countries, pitch their tents and settle in.
But feelings of frustration come.
When a helicopter flies over, the migrants shout "Open the borders!" and curse at the Hungarian police riot police.
Some refuse food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just indirect harm.
In the coming days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the bloc of 28 failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at an ongoing meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece, and spoke with the hope of reaching an eventual agreement next month or by the end of the year by which EU nations would accept more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria have called a special EU European summit for Tuesday next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not pin its hopes on Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up court cases for asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country now that the fence on the Serbian border is completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on a list of those who helped stretch barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them were economic migrants seeking a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
New laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize the violation of the 4-meter fence that the government has erected on the southern border with Serbia, and also establish longer prison sentences for those who illegally smuggle refugees.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have been observing heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic defense adviser, said authorities had caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and had already caught 15 on state territory.
They penetrated through damage to the fence and are now in police custody charged with committing offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow vehicle covered with barbed wire.
Chaos ensued at the main border crossing at Roszke as Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing, creating a crowd of people.
About 20 of them fit inside, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is winning support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main contests, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly deciding which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground with several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but her lead is narrowing.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind her.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now equals.
But Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is only 5 points behind her in that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the state say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her simply because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, current Clinton supporters are particularly passionate about her.
Views are mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, the great possibility of election and agreement on problems is cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential run, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to lead — a third think he shouldn't.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as a second choice to nominate a party, Biden was the most common choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half cited Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead will expand from 20 points when Biden runs to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; But that number has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be electable is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of a candidate, Democratic voters prefer solving problems to a better chance of being elected.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate is posing as an unacceptable candidate to those primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as sincere and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Of the three, Biden leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't think so.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are consistent with their ideological view.
By all of these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as Secretary of State continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying it has not affected their overall view of her at all.
But among the American public, it's a different story overall.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the issue was divided back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy has no bearing on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent have worsened their opinion of Clinton.
These are mainly Republicans, with more than 6 in 10 saying their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among her party's voters, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points last month and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think she is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush performed best in honesty.
Sanders is seen by more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, many voters have not formed an opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson trails Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates account for half of the electorate in the latest poll, leaving the others to rally support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23 percent support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27 percent on Tuesday.
But Carson shot up from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson does well across demographic groups, excluding Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carla Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is behind, with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker completely on the stands, falling from 10% support to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6%, and it was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, released last week, showed that Carson improved to reach 19% support among Republicans behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump is well ahead of Carson.
With Carson's upward trend, Trump decided to shoot blindly at a retired neurosurgeon, and even apologized for questioning Carson about Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five fraternity members charged over death of first-year student Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died during an overloading fraternal ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges have been filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and belatedly took him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police announced.
Police say he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand totaling 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his destination through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of Pi Delta Dogs did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, according to police.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood's national president, for advice, Police Chief Chris Vagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their equipment, essentially prioritizing the well-being of the brotherhood over the life of Michael Deng," Chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck in the head, torso and thighs with a blunt object.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity overburdening, and at least one student has died every year from overburdening since the 1970s," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
The fraternity and their members must be held accountable, and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
The Monroe County Grand Jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault by aggregation and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to detain not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, either officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a Tuesday news conference.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity broke off its relationship with local chapters.
This is what happens when the Fed raises interest rates
Rate hikes will come, and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it will take and how long it will take.
For economics specifically, the history of a small originator offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why U.S. Federal Reserve officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rate hikes will start, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are indeed more variables at play.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss about increasing speed can be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money' era," Julian Jessop, senior global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to the more normal but still low ones to create the seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that adverse effects will occur.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the past month or so, the expected rate hikes may make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for stocks to stop again 12-24 months after the first hike, which again may reflect a lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed's hike.
More specifically, over the past 35 years or so, the market has often headed the most — about 14 percent — to rate hikes relatively flat over 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.  posted on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle, and the return starts to diminish.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help.
Currently, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and that could precipitate a recession.
Most notably, gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history with the Fed's rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 rate hikes since 1950, there has been only two nominal annual increases in GDP below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to maintain when it was at just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this difficult economic backdrop could be risky, and the question could arise "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants have been prepared for the Fed's rise all year, and all eyes have been on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, there is only a 25 percent probability of future trading.
"In our study since 1950, all upward cycles so far have been in a super leveraging cycle with GDP masking the peaks of the onset of recession very quickly after the incipient recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this has clearly been a slow recovery since the worst recession of the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has expected since the end of the last recession; The record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and still ongoing.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market expects a rate hike and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more quickly felt in bonds than in equities when the Fed changes course of policy.
For bonds, yields seem to change direction immediately after the first advent of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that raising rates will cause yields to converge between long- and short-dated bonds, leveling out the curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in this climate, though "we're still wary of straining yields," Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already aligned with the Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has increased — all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, firms that conduct most of their business in the U.S. will win after the interest rate rises and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with a lot of debt will fare worse because a rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the 'quality' of stocks tends to surpass within three months of an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a note to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance sheet companies by an average of 5 percentage points in each interest rate hike in 1994, 1999, 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as inventories with low volatility, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points, respectively).
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with high floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to the pure stock game, consumers are also benefiting from the rising dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the station for "dumbing down"
He believes he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial rival
He has also taken aim at the BBC Music Awards and says they are simply cheating on the British
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and says it is not an original idea either
BBC Radio 3 is "morphing" into Classic FM, says a leading MP, piling up fresh pressure on broadcasters to prove they are doing something commercial broadcasts are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbed down" and was becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be — I don't like to use the word 'dumbed' — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which opened in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appear to be Britishly under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different — these are two examples that come to mind where you're actually just mimicking what we already have in the market," Bingham said.
The BBC's chief executive rejected the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and making music is actually second to none.
"I also think Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting it into new works is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it was now necessary to work harder to engage audiences than before because Britons were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production to come under fire for stepping on the heels of business competitors during the broadcasts of Culture, Media and Sport and they were heard by the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as judges - had been produced "in a manner typical of the BBC".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" the next time it starts a fun series.
However, he declined to rule out ordering more future seasons of The Voice or spending royalty money on other entertainment formats.
Online sales are growing at the slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000
Online sales boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could be a reason for the slowdown in spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, turning many of Britain's main streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are signs of online sales stabilising, with new figures showing a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the smallest increase in growth since early 2000, with an increase of just 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of online sales stabilising, with new figures showing a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth over the past years and you go back to 2000, it has always rationalised over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG revenue index.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is stagnating somewhat, and therefore seems to be fading.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was borrowed from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from shopping ahead of this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, five times as many shoppers have turned to their computers to make purchases, taking down several retailers' websites in the process.
Experts believe Black Friday, which has allowed shoppers to bargain again, may keep customers from making further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 for every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims buried victims of crane collapse in Mecca and Bin Laden's family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly blaming the collapse of construction tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane collapse at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried down the street.
Dressed in some form of white, the mourners chose their path and paid their respects to the victims when the first of the fallen made it on his last journey to the cemetery at Al-Moaissem.
The sad message passed by the holy site where, just a few days earlier, a construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled on the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial, and the Saudi king sanctioned a construction group of bin Laden's family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after a crane collapsed at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was Qasim Aram, a father of four from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual haj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the haj to Mecca will take place, and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in operation.
The Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi News Agency, states that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The disk agency's English service did not report this detail, but said the company's bosses had been banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused a crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are converging ahead of the Haj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group did not issue any statement about the crane collapse and representatives were not made available for comment.
Royal decrees also accused the group of failing to apply the latest safety measures, and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and has run major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son whom the family had renounced in the nineties.
The crash happened amid strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must undertake at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials determined that one million riyals (£174,000) would be donated to relatives of those killed, and the same amount to the permanently wounded.
Other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European traders working for cheap are no longer trending
Britons are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is beyond the growth point
The result is 200 Screwfix stores open aimed at traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Edited by Rupert Steiner, Senior Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be putting down hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed East European craftsmen to work in their homes
If you can do it with a hammer or a paintbrush, it seems that you are in the minority today.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY work in their homes, according to the head of the company behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, says the large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer the trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more screwfix stores aimed at retailers, and is closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Laury says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten in-store purchasing decisions are made by the better halves.
At present, the majority of workers are male.
She said there is a need to address increasing demographic trends that show more female households making more home adjustments than in the past.
Laury says, "We still have mostly men working in our stores.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women, who make 80% of the decisions regarding the purchase of goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies in Britain's FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect equality between male and female CEOs.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the number of women among employees, including the executive and chief financial officer.
Laury says: "It was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
So it was not difficult to find good women to take to us.
Kingfisher reported a drop in both mid-year earnings and sales after the group took on the costs of closing stores.
The result of the trend of Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 vice-chairman Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
Zbyněk Stanjura, chairman of the ODS deputies, noted that the one-off contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better for it to be in the standard indexation, because it would be reflected in the coming years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to arrange this," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which next year it was to be indexed beyond the law.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said is not rosy.
According to her, a higher valorization next year would mean a budgetary impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are discussing every hundred million.
Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past it had reduced the pace of valorization.
Rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right-wing's veto will significantly complicate and possibly make it impossible to pay in December, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD deputies, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed shortening the deadline for discussing the law in committee to ten or 20 days, which was also blocked by the right.
But the committee will have a month to do so instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost the state a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money should come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year, pensions should increase by an average of about one hundred crowns.
According to the pension amendment, the contribution should be given to people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those whose pension entitlement expired in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to apply for the surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are indexed regularly as of January, by price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of the gross wage, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
According to the state final account, the state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more year-on-year.
Expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all expenditure required by law.
The average full old-age pension increased by CZK 104 to CZK 10,714 last year, according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin abandoned plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
According to Russian media, the billionaire's Senate seat was almost certain.
In the Federation Council, he was supposed to represent the western Russian Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Tsukanov easily defended his position in Sunday's elections as a candidate of the ruling United Russia party.
According to Russian law, senators are not elected by the citizens, but are chosen by the governor from three candidates whose names he announces before the gubernatorial election.
After the election, he chooses the senator from the three candidates.
A complication for Yakuninin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin found an exception for Yakunin, saying that he is an ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary who is not covered by the legal requirement of long-term residence.
Filming of the Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger has ended.
The last straw in the main character's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janžurová decided about her grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he is with his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová on a similar journey.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, and he wants to live with dignity and freedom again.
He longs to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the existing one, Nightingale said about the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedy form a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would fall to Bartošek, with whom he had already worked on the series Invisible.
Nevertheless, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with recovery from a serious illness, surprised him.
We agreed three years ago.
I gave him a script to read and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised that he was apparently a hooded athlete.
In the past, he would always ask where he would sit before shooting the next scene.
This time he rode a bike, climbed rocks and even walked uphill.
And all this in record-breaking tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoška, women take a tiger to turn it into a rabbit over time.
They feed him some food, but close the door immediately so that he doesn't accidentally think of playing tiger outside the rabbit house.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, is played by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and well-intentioned.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also depicts the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and sons-in-law Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-produced by Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The American internet company Google has promised to provide up to $ 5.5 million (CZK 132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing into Europe.
The announcement was made on Tuesday by Google.org, the charitable arm of the internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled part of Telička's visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Pavel Telička, a Czech member of the European Parliament for the ANO movement, postponed his planned trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telička, Baku justifies this by an EP resolution from last week criticizing human rights violations in Azerbaijan, which Telička co-authored.
By the decision of the Azerbaijani side, Telička lost the possibility of talks with official partners and also the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which had been planned several months in advance, to meet with the leadership of parliament and representatives of the executive as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the Czech News Agency said.
The EP resolution condemns the 'unprecedented repression of civil society in Azerbaijan'.
She called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after the recent sentencing of Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadija Ismayilova, who campaigned for exposing corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building an air base in Syria.
During his visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not rule out that a Russian air base in Syria will be established in the future.
We do not have such plans yet.
But nothing is out of the question, he said.
Russia has a long-standing naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which it has used more as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian press reports, however, since the beginning of August, deliveries of Russian armaments and military equipment to Syria have increased.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from current trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians intend to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which for now remains a stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, American commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the situation in Syria with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday, their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow to convey concern over the buildup of Russian arsenals near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Assad a losing bet.
He said the goals of Russia's policy in Syria were rather unclear.
Moscow has made Syria its satellite, he said.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what kind of goal is not entirely clear, according to Earnest.
The war in Syria, according to today's speculation in the Russian press, is to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbass.
According to a report by The New York Times today, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during a UN meeting.
But opinions among White House advisers are said to be divided.
The TASS news agency, citing the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, wrote today that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York visit.
Sesame oil should be used during a gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When cold pressed from seeds, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder oils.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these have been the most frequent cause of death of Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammations bother mainly women, sesame oil helps.
If you are a lover of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in cooking food and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in gallbladder diets.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of gallstones.
They are 90% the cause of gallbladder inflammations and women suffer from these problems 3 times more often than men.
In general, gallbladder problems mainly concern overweight people who do not play sports and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used in the liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should beware of goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use over-roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
However, the oil will lose all its active substances, said Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in the Sokolov region, which produces cold-pressed organic virgin oils.
The company also newly produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our press can press 8 kilos of sesame.
Mechanical pressing heats the raw material to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, nutrients would be lost.
Sunflower oil is beneficial for diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
A survey conducted by Jarmila Hamerská, which she led at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it starts to burn at 180 ° C.
It is better to use it, for example, to flavor salads and is especially useful in a diet in which it helps prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids reduce cholesterol levels the most.
For heart problems, you need to pay attention to the amount of total fat and calories intake.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of sea buckthorn oil there are 99 calories.
When it comes to the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts as long as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
Storing it in the refrigerator extends the shelf life even more.
Old oil people recognize especially by the bitter taste.
On the contrary, the defect is not turbidity at the bottom.
It is a sign that the substance has not been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Industrial hemp seeds are among the so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation owes the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and a person must receive them from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that Bohemia Olej's best selling oil is one of the best-selling.
500 litres of it are sold annually.
People often take one tablespoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Hemp oil is not strong in taste, but it greatly strengthens immunity, advised Daniel Vlček from the Kraslice company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of barbecue makers are Americans.
There are 1.4 grills per household.
Various barbecue competitions are held all over the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not far behind either.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have never grilled in their lives.
The vast majority then grill several times a year.
In order for the grilling to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - the ideal is to prepare the meat by marinating a few hours before cooking.
Which oil is best for this and at the same time retains healthy substances when grilling?
In general, the grilling process itself should save fat.
Experts agree that a large part of oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then lose the body's beneficial substances, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their use when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When you say meat, experts from Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in the Sokolov region immediately think of grape oil.
It wonderfully complements the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen is characterized by the unique property of enhancing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 ° C.
Even at such a high temperature, it is one of the few oils that retains its health-promoting substances, Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Olej, which is one of the few Czech producers of this oil from the grapevine, describes the benefits of grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Due to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape seed oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves skin elasticity, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for preparing cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for cooking dishes.
When grilling, it can be used in two ways, marinating and grilling itself.
Marinating meat and fish will preserve their juiciness.
When preparing the marinade, three components must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, add acidity with apple cider vinegar to soften the meat.
Spices add flavor to the meat and preserve the oil and give the right zest, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, he adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating, because it is one of the few oils that can penetrate through dark meat.
So marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, what to do next?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare meals.
The same goes for barbecues.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies especially to linseed, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, smear the grate with oil to prevent the food from burning.
An essential part of grilling is also the preparation of side dishes.
Grilled meat and fish are suitable for practically anything - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
The chefs from Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, the Hot Summer salad.
For it you need: • 1 piece of peach • 1 bunch of arugula • 1 cup of chopped cucumber • 1 cup of salad leaf mixture • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
In a salad bowl, add shredded arugula, chopped cucumbers and a large cube peach to the salad leaf mixture.
Salt and pepper to taste, you can also flavor with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drizzle with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can then sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it depends not only on medications, but also on the will of the patient to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, the care of these patients also includes social and legal counseling, recommendations for housing adjustment, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally influenced by the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors point out, the passivity of the sick frees up space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it has been proven that regular exercise significantly delays the time when the patient needs a compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not succumb to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That is why the Give Yourself a Chance (www.bezmytu.cz) page was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give Yourself a Chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, the saying applies twice that the sooner the disease is treated, the more the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the chance that we will be able to stop the disease and delay disability, explains Eva Medová from the Department of Neurology of the General University Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
Patients are worked with according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, alleviate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It is really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient," says Dr. Martina Kövári, head physician of the Department of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine at the Motol University Hospital.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the immune status of the body, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that patients check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
"Exercise also releases endorphins and makes you feel good," says PhDr. Kamila Řasová from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University Hospital Královské Vinohrady.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We directly intervene in the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"In the past, these patients were so-called sparing, today we know that they need a targeted load," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, Head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine at the Motol University Hospital.
The aim of physiotherapy is to allow a person to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including a job title.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with occupational therapists so that each person receives a compensation aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people are shaken.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
They have to respond to a large load - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we should go to someone, not try to bear everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them so that they eventually come to the conclusion that even with a handicap it is possible to live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Department of Neurology of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses would not fly.
Aerospace manufacturing is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
New planes are full of titanium or light and strong composite materials that no one can produce and process.
Still, next to super-precise, computer-controlled machine tools, next to autoclaves for forming composites, you can come across something as ordinary as apricot stones.
In a drum that resembles a cotton candy pot, the edges of sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are tumbled in a pile of pits.
"So far, no one has come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of aircraft door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
On the premises in Prague's Letňany, the former Letov manufactures complete doors for the Airbus A320.
They are the only company in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
Through the doors, part of which is assembled in Prague, passengers also enter first and higher class on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner, the Airbus A380.
Doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner are also assembled here.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the company has torque wrenches adjusted twice a year.
If the yellow sticker lacked a record of inspection, they would have something to explain to auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who regularly go to check whether the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
However, advanced technology has not yet completely replaced the human senses.
There are 1500 rivets on one door to the A320.
These must be knocked by hand by the riveters.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the hammer falling, they can tell if the rivet is already properly shaken.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
During the inspection, it is time to have a trained touch.
When the inspector runs his finger over a row of rivets, he knows if one is out of tolerance.
Only then does he pick up an accurate indicator.
Before 1989, Letov supported the L-39 military training aircraft program.
But in 1991, not one was produced.
The company had to quickly find new orders.
At that time, it teamed up with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
It won the tender for an emergency door supplier for the A321.
The courtship with Boeing was not so happy.
"At that time, we were a small company that did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable supplies," recalls Dubský.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained slammed shut if Letov had not attracted the attention of the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the International Association of the Aviation Industry in 1999.
I talked about our cooperation with Airbus.
On the second day, negotiations with the French started, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new orders came with the strong company.
In 2000, the installation of door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, the upper deck doors for the A380 were added.
In 2006, the company built a new composites processing hall for deliveries for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we would not have been able to get to these large commissions ourselves.
Maybe we would do parts or small parts.
Partners want supply guarantees for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.
Last year, Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over CZK 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
Exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers does not come for free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company would not produce any aircraft doors.
According to Dubský, obtaining certificates that production processes meet customer requirements and maintaining them in repeated inspections costs millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and strict.
We have to train employees, retrofit the equipment and re-certify the whole process, adds Dubský.
Now the company is completing the preparation of a process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the existing cadmium harmful to human health.
Although they received the assignment from the manufacturer, they then had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come, check the concept of the entire route.
Then we show them the production.
They will also check our laboratory.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, explains Dubský about the way customers check them.
The Prague company is rewarded with long-term exclusive contracts.
Today, the production of embraers stands or falls with the Prague plant.
For the A320 produces half of the total volume of the doors.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
However, this does not mean that he can ask for any price at the door.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It indicates how much one door will cost after ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces produced.
The price per piece keeps dropping towards a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If not, we will lose, says Dubský.
Half of the hall, where electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, a new semi-robotic line for riveting and door assembly for the innovated A320 Neo model is being built here.
Riveting becomes faster and more accurate.
"This is the trend that assembly in aviation is taking," adds Dubský.
Sales are assured for the future line.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 units of the new A320.
Just a few metres away, a line will be built for the complete installation of doors for the upper deck of the A380.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and costs.
Full assembly could begin within two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must pass qualification tests, for example, to install some electrical and electronic equipment in the doors of the largest Airbus.
The company also relies on further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company to be able to process composites in addition to metallic materials," says Dubský proudly.
However, Latecoere is reaching the edge of production capacities in the Czech Republic.
There is no other place in the Letov area, where it is located.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now it has 800, and in three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing compete over how many hundreds of new planes airlines order each year, they don't have to worry about their jobs.
Although it has orders for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money to repay the loans in September.
Eventually, Latecoere was able to negotiate with major creditors.
At the end of August, it exchanged part of the loans for shares.
Creditors acquired a 37.4 percent stake in the company by increasing their capital by 57.4 million euros.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, or 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company subscribed for new shares worth EUR 222.9 million among its existing shareholders.
In total, it raised share capital by EUR 280 million.
At the same time, the entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
It expects average order growth of four percent per year until 2017.
In the order book, it has orders worth 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four years of production.
French media claim that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on drips.
The Czech plant in Letňany, Prague, is important for groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group's revenues.
In terms of the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
MEPs supported a larger share of the state's share of coal charges.
The change in fees for mineral extraction should bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, it should have a neutral impact on municipal budget revenues because the fee should be higher.
Last year, municipalities received about CZK 450 million from fees and the state budget CZK 150 million.
From brown coal mining, about 200 million crowns went to municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the payment from mining areas with permitted mining to one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these payments is to continue to belong entirely to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that municipalities will receive CZK 14 million to 100 million annually instead of 14 million.
The amount of mining royalties will no longer be determined by law, but will be set by government regulation.
The remuneration is newly calculated as the product of the quantity of the extracted mineral and the rate for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned that setting the fee by government decree may not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax because the state charges for a mineral that is state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of underground coal mining, three-quarters of the money will go to municipalities and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money collected by the state in mining royalties will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The bill was criticized today by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would harm municipalities affected by mining and regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the finance minister improve his budget," said David Kádner (Úsvit), elected in the Ústí region.
Communist Party MP Hana Aulicka warned against the rise in unemployment in the Most region.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because more than 90 percent of the prices are long-term contracted.
Major consumers, such as power stations or CHP plants, should therefore not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
In its view, however, the increase in charges is acceptable from the point of view of employment.
According to Milan Urban (ČSSD), the rapporteur on the amendment, it is crucial that deputies know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on coal mining limits, before approving the law.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the Czechoslovak Army mine should be made only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, economic and long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching as the US Federal Reserve prepares to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates in a range of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been a long time since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and begin the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy performed relatively well, with a recovery by adding trillions of dollars to the Treasury account and creating only a low level of inflation.
Nevertheless, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
They warned markets to be prepared for an increase, but circumstances suggest they also see great chances against the move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
Gunman at Delta State University Leaves Message
Shannon Lamb, who shot and killed his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday — and later that day a colleague — wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he could take it back, government authorities revealed Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called police around ten o'clock Monday morning
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police officers to his house.
He said: "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "cute dog" in the house who "will not bother anyone" but is upset.
Police demanded the caller's name, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why there was shooting in the house.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss, and a handwritten note from Lamb that said, "I'm so sorry and wish I could take this back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who's ever loved me."
After leaving a note, Lamb made the 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
The university's dean, William LaForge, said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something going on in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Despite Monday's announcement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss's romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities said there was "no evidence" of a "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentissa for more than seven years, said she was a "great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was "shaken" by the case.
O'Steen said Rentissa and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentisss worked from home over the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he "will not go to jail."
When officers caught up with him on a highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a resume posted on the school's website, Lamb earned his doctorate in education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He battled leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All these things are certainly taking their toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat against PSV Eindhoven.
While the left-back was left in tears by the injury and sidelined him for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and an oxygen mask was also required before he was taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double fracture of his leg and is now in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps the day after tomorrow and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible – a guy who comes to Manchester at 18 has a very hard time, but he's playing fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
Wept.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he will play this season.
Moreno was very lucky not to receive a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not penalize the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly tackle on both legs.
A tweet from Shaw's account said: "Thank you all for their messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger."

The England defender will have added motivation to recover with the European Championship in France next July.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It was a very ugly injury.
When any player leaves the pitch with an injury like that, everyone is very sad.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the seriousness of that injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I was unable to perceive this moment.
I only saw the ball going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see a tackle on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I am very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: when a child loves a book, it doesn't take long for them to memorize it.
But you must not be David Cameron.
When asked by a children's scheme provider to name a popular children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a 1971 fable by Dr Seuss.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with strong content, one that I loved to read to my children because there was always an image or message behind it that I had never seen before."
Well, except that in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the plot of the book from an extract from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill in the brief original text.
"In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is the brief content of the book, which records the object of love unknown to Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that weren't suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron reads like a summary of the film Lorax, which can be found on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not have familiarized himself with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being devastated by the greedy, tree-felling industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titular Lorap, a crouching, moustachioed creature who "speaks behind the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively minor PR task was given to a helper who had never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text likely came from the office of Cameron's supporters.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of England's omission, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team England have selected for this tour, I think a repeat of the 3-0 defeat they suffered last time in the test series will be unlikely.
I also wouldn't directly rule out winning guests.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting line-up and the collective mindset is also strong; They won't carry the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the trial series level, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of Team England in a practice series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is a tough nut to crack for me to analyse because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketer players are judged on their performance.
For example, there were no question marks around Joe Root's name, which led to the announcement because — and I've mentioned this before — players are their own best selectors.
A few more half-centuries, and Lyth could extend his streak, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, another opportunity will arise.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even if his performances were not entirely perfect, and that doesn't surprise me; He was always a team player.
The question of how much probationary time a batsman gets to show up is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps — the same as Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance home and away.
The only thing you could complain about is that England gave Jonathan Trott the first chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in top form — but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes in and he's a batsman I rate very positively.
He's the x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all this will of course depend on the overall line-up in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get an extra spinner while retaining four quicks, has been floated and I have no objection to it.
I don't understand why a strokemaker can't tee and this left-handed man has already shown that he is an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was No. 3 to them and it doesn't make much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
He immediately managed three centuries and did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari joins the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, he impressed me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his crude stats — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a punt, but there aren't a lot of spinners who raise their hands, and selectors opt for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seem to have made some changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
Appointing Mahel Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring a wealth of experience by having experience with all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood arrives in the white-ball part of the tour and brings both energy and merciless spark to the team.
I always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's team-mate Ben Stokes was given a day off, just as Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that decision.
Even if many disagree on this, coaches and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-conceived strategy of renegotiating to keep Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with each passing day, even without the election of the genius Jeremy "Is it a Yes or No?" Corbyn at the head of the Workers' Party, or the TUC will take on the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some member states have had enough of Britain's egocentric agenda, divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes that most of them did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn't want that, even if they eroded social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants an inward-looking Britain in a European Europe – "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin – suggests that some short-sighted ministers and bureaucrats in some capitals have reached a point where they don't care about us leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with the too-long Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's hard to watch them break their legs with the help of selfies of Britons who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don't want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately unhelpful SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from the negotiations."
Europeans know, to their detriment, how predatory Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the press oligarchs are of the barons, because they were not in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 by a 2-1 margin.
They may dimly remember the name of Boris Johnson, the cunning Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself as the Brussels rapporteur of the "EU straight bananas" in the early nineties.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-free villains, foreigners hacking phones, and the pseudo-non-overseas departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but he realised that when you're in a cage with a rabid gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she doesn't have you for dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself, opposing Cameron's referendum routine, ever since Blair admitted the principle of the abolished EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him the card of being fired.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he had no more time on me - seems in danger of readopting the Murdoch boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock, a mistake then as now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose seat he left the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving.
He says he would like to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the frantic tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly accept it.
Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said the same thing on radio and television this week, when his Inner Scout couldn't bare to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was the wrong decision.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father fought for his loyalty on TV without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "no matter what" — Benn's phrase — apparently wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey – remember, it touched me too – the discipline of the message remains important in the ages of all-day television broadcasting, and especially in the whirlwind, hotbed of paranoia and betrayal that is social media
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take Workers' Party support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell has put it.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic prevarication about EU membership – in line with their Bennite-besieging economy, anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his prevarication about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC's campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of it all for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - for Britain's concessions when it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed with Britain's "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in cutting the costs of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded at Monday's launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise review of electronic published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency's statement that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry, according to the researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in its e-cigarette report by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published the "landmarking" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the comprehensiveness of the data, highlighting links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy base" on which PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts writing for the BMJ questioned the claims, which were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They state that the public might expect PHE's claim that "current best guess is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harm, associated with various nicotine-containing products; The results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell say one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also endorsed the public health mandate of BAT in a sustainability report, it says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding it allegedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reason for the selection of the panel members is not available, but they include several well-known champions of e-cigarettes, some of whom also claim industry financing in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting at PHE was also attended by the tobacco leadership.
The group's report "eloquently admits" the lack of "hard evidence that most products are harmful to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claim that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a pathway to smoking for children or non-smokers" was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the statement in the BMJ had been answered before.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers dies because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly highlighting current evidence – that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking – we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should do away with EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give their right hand" to hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programmes that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, likely to be watched by only a handful, in difficult airtimes compared to rivals "the biggest ratings show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried without success to link with the BBC for the six years he had worked on Channel 4.
"I'm struggling with the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson told the House of Lords' communications committee, as part of negotiations on the BBC's future.
If you keep royalties, which I'm not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, you should reduce the creation of at least programs that others do not produce or commission.
They broadcast The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and understandably nonsensical.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded non-contributory.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would give their right hand for them.
I cannot understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I do not think that would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC he felt guilty of catching up ratings "because of the ambition of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo those made by former Sky chief executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the BBC's more pampered public service programmes "are moving to BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they are fulfilling their authority and can argue as they prepare for their hypocritical mission of justifying £4bn of royalty income, "But of course we do all these obscure programmes that nobody is looking at."
They broadcast them at a time when no one is watching.
On the royalty, Johnson told the commission: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that £150 a year is a big sum, but for people for whom £150 is a lot, I would be surprised if they paid that much, because they don't watch the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission in terms of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the BBC's small production volume had now been previously classified as educational – it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on radio – and should take as a model public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and turn into "inform, clarify and entertain".
On the subject of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which only a handful have been televised, and connect with commercial reporters so we can see them all online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which nematodes move.
Scientists have raised worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can control sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists Can Read and Record Brain Activity Using Light
The researchers said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activate outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation — an invasive procedure in which electrodes are inserted into a patient's brain to stimulate the brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that reactions occur when they are placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, the bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
Amplified ultrasound waves act in TRP-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are connected, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method bears much resemblance to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light.
But Chalasani said sonogenetics could have many advantages over the technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by an optical fiber to a desired location in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements shaming the British arms trade.
Watch a video about the anti-arms market from Amnesty International.
Terrifying killer drones!
Leg shackles that break ankles!
Fragmentation bullets!
And electric stun batons that cause unbearable pain, but leave no traces!
A cheerful voice and a caricature of metaphors leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment of the International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also being waged with posters popping up at bus stops and subways that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Travel to the DPR from September 15 to 18?" reads one, using the font with the signs of the London Underground with the DPR lines becomes the image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DPR ... Customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
About 300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute them across London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen key, which reportedly "will gain access to around a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the galleries.
Many artists switch to working with activists within protest movements, realizing that they need to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the posters against about the arms trade greets passengers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours on Facebook and was produced by a VCCP agency working without pay, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would have been surprised by the silence surrounding ads about the arms trade — seeing an empty space on the ExCeL calendar — and thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with creating a more realistic, risky corporate ad, but "by adding bright colors and animation, we made it appeal to more people."
"They did a fantastic job of raising concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military for "an AT4CS RS launcher on the shoulder."
This includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it will not be pleasant.
The Eight Golden Rules for Student Dormitory Life
I moved to student dorms 11 years ago as an oblivious nineteen-year-old, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I resented—and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to dorms can range from slightly nerve-wracking to totally horrible.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you've taken a year off, what you think of Corbyn and why "you honestly don't love or hate Marmite because people, it's just yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath too - ask questions and show interest.
It drives the conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were issuing fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night locations and communal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts in college come up short.
Your room should be a refuge, yet many dorms turn into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, sociable, and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This can be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to recognize when a classmate is tired of socializing — and maybe write to him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
One boy in my dorm used to be invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Since you started going to university at the height of baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and performing with a slab baked cookies seems slightly less strange, less than, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and they may end up matching your face to a tasty surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and lead are likely to make others pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Theft of food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Stealing a whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is a drop of milk in your tea a theft?
Double check with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that they will offer you milk even if they are raging inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate who traded her milk for dishwashing detergent to punish the thief.
Now he's in prison.
You should not make sounds that disturb people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also a famous person in glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could quiet down the drum and bass a bit because it was 3 at night and she had a test in the morning.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When they finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours and then turned on her own music, locked the door, and left for her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse went to the same dorms as you?
Conversely, wouldn't it be horribly embarrassing if you mistook roommates for your future spouse, slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day, and maybe she would also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you can't command your heart – but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to talk to your weaknesses at least a little.
In the uplifting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good prank is funny, but easy to correct.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about keeping them secure by hiding something for them – never ruin someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put their keys in a water bottle to put in the freezer – but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite uncertain future prospects.
Eva experienced hard times already during her pregnancy with the now seven-year-old Vítek.
His father broke up with her and she was alone in preparing and raising the child.
I coped with the situation quite quickly - I was very much looking forward to the baby and I was looking for positives in it.
I tried not to worry about the uncertainty and the fact that I would be alone with the child.
And I certainly had hope that we would not be alone for long, Eva recalls her first pregnancy today.
Already at that time, she met an older Vašek on the Internet chat, with whom they began to talk about their favorite films.
Vašek even drove Eva and Vítek home from the maternity hospital, but he did not rush into the role of stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for some time," Eva described in the documentary series Four in That 3.
The motif of the third season of the Czech Television series is the search for happiness on the second attempt.
She managed to take care of Vítek and the financial security of the family thanks to her part-time job and the great help of her mother and aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for someone else's child did not spoil Vašek's affection for Eva.
They finally got together around Vítek's second birthday and he now understands Vašek as his dad and also addresses him as such.
Although Vašek already has two adult daughters, he says he enjoys fatherhood at sixty and devotes more time to his children.
In addition to Vítek, they were joined by two-year-old Leontýnka and finally twins.
"Vasek came into our family somewhat naturally, maybe because my mother never talked much into my relationships," says a smiling Eva.
Not enough space?
At least we're close.
Twins Emma and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with cholestasis during pregnancy at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which are then in excessive amounts in the blood of a pregnant woman and are manifested mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after birth it usually disappears spontaneously.
To Eva's and Vašek's happiness, Emma and Ela were born healthy, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emička was placed in an incubator in the intermediate department, where Vašek's niece also works, who managed to take her over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after the transfer from the ICU to the room I had her with me, says Eva, describing the challenging period after the birth.
She spent twenty days in the maternity hospital until the doctors agreed to release the babies, who had managed to reach the two-kilo mark in the meantime.
Waiting for the baby to be recruited in the maternity hospital did not make Eva happy.
"I was mad with nostalgia for my husband and children," the mother of four recalls the difficult moments in the postpartum department.
She and her husband also considered signing the reverse, among other things, because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen and the doctors released Eva and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
Quite a large family can be modest.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric double hotplate and cramped conditions.
Although the house did not get bigger, Vasek made Eva happy by installing a gas stove to make the preparation of food for six people more comfortable.
When it's the best, we'll take turns taking a taxi.
Eva is convinced that children perceive mainly family comfort and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or shabbiness of the house.
So far, we have put together very nicely, better than we expected.
It's harder to hide the mess in a small space and we sometimes step over rolling babies, but at least we're all close, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side in every situation.
Vašek's work as a film lighting technician is no guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes goes out into the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his sixties, he says he can physically take care of the finances of his family and children, but how long will it be so?
"I realize that due to our age difference, one day I will be the one to feed this family," Eva admits frankly when asked about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted by the possibility of her own business.
With four children, I'm not exactly a target for employers.
And when the worst comes to worst, my husband and I can take turns taking a taxi, jokes the nice blonde.
Apple has suffered a yo-yo effect.
It's all the displays' fault.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a stronger chassis and a display that recognizes the power of touch are the strengths of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple's trend so far has been that each new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The only exceptions were the third and fourth generations, whose weight has slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference to the detriment of the novelty was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the weight of the smaller model increased by 14 grams, and the larger one by 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year's bending in Apple's pockets suffered considerably.
The chassis of the novelties is made of more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which is also reflected in the weight.
But it has a much bigger impact on the displays.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology for the novelties, thanks to which the displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, it was necessary to provide the display with an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the new iPhone's displays has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For the smaller iPhone, from 12 grams to 29 grams, for the larger one, from 19 to 40 grams.
With iPhone 6s, the display is the heaviest component used.
The weight of only 143 grams is also achieved thanks to the slimming treatment, which touched most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, the heaviest element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the largest increase is evident in the display.
The 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus weighs 192 grams.
How practical the new display technology will be will only become apparent during use.
The first users will be able to try it out on Friday, September 25, when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will go on sale in selected countries.
Have breakfast flakes been champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have managed to find a find that opens up interesting possibilities.
They found traces of modern human settlement from different eras, including murals, tool remains, and so on and so forth.
But in layer 23A, which is mapped back about 30,000 years, scientists have discovered something that closely resembles the remains of a breakfast buffet.
Traces of oat grains were found on the spot, which apparently went through the process of producing today's so popular flakes.
Today, the grains are first soaked, then dried, stripped of the shell, the so-called plough, then scalded and distinguished flat.
In Paglicci cave, grains were discovered that were apparently heated or steamed, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this is indicated by traces of use on two stones in the cave.
The researchers were unable to document in their publication for the journal PNAS that the cave had a complete snowflake making process, but the similarity is indeed striking.
We also have no evidence of how humans could have eaten the flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly warm is, of course, quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting example of how intensively people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes preceded agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New station announcements in the Brno Public Transport Company.
So once again I listened to the announcement of the names of stops in the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Phantom, Frázova, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was a bit noisier, so the announcement in a male voice was somewhat less intelligible than before when stops were announced in a female voice.
A woman's voice is higher, so in deeper traffic noise it is more recognizable than a deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know which ones, no one asked me, but they certainly chose that from studio recordings made in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the noise of a bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for quite a few decades, so I know the correct names of all those stops by heart, so I don't need these announcements, but foreigners from elsewhere who are not familiar with Brno and for whom these announcements are primarily intended may be confused and may claim at the final stop where they accidentally arrived that the stop where they were supposed to get off,  has not been reported at all.
Perhaps the selection of the announcer - but better again the announcer - should be done again, and this time tinged with the usual traffic noise and the rumble of the engine, in which the humming of the speaker in the bus is almost lost.
So that we don't have to listen to the names of the stations Vodní Heršpice, Šmírova, or Ponorná in the creaking shalina to which I transferred in Komárov.
I suppose my old man's hearing didn't suddenly deteriorate so much during the one day the stop announcer changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the notes of the trackman.
Today, few people know what the biggest and smartest thing to do under the party was the so-called comprehensive background checks.
I allowed myself to remember it.
The bus was delayed.
I burst into the dispatcher's office the moment the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't collide with Comrade Chief, he came a minute before you and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher remarked as I entered the arrival book.
Thanks, I'll watch out.
Write me that I am going around the districts to revise the small mechanization.
That won't work, there are checks today.
Everyone is fucked up, even horrible.
What is it all about?
"You'll see," the dispatcher sneered.
Next time you'll be too.
I ran out into the hallway.
Suddenly the door of the chief's office opened and the chief appeared.
Uptight, stone-faced, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I greeted respectfully, quickly buttoning the two buttons of my jacket.
"Good morning," came the reply, and I rushed up to the second floor, unaware of the cold, sinister tone in which the old man had responded.
"You're messing around," Eva, an elderly lady whom I respected, greeted me.
Apparently she was even a chief before the comrades deposed her.
There are checks and you arrive just like that.
How many times have I asked what these complex screenings are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say they are once every three years, everyone has to go to them, and it's quite unpleasant.
At least for some.
I'll see.
I pulled out a file with periodic reports from a drawer and then a phone.
"Here Holcman, come to me at once," said the chief's voice.
What annoys?
Now we met and nothing ..." I mumbled, but no one answered, each with only his thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I have come on your orders," I said as I entered the Chief's office.
The chief sat behind his desk and examined a paper.
"Comrade Mechanisator," he said after a while, without raising his head and still carefully examining the paper, "I do not like your behavior at all."
He threw the paper on the table, leaned back in his chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly gaze.
I was unsure.
What's going on?
Just yesterday, the Deputy Minister praised the fact that I had worked very well during the few months in office and that he was extremely satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
Realize that you are a track distance technician and you have to behave accordingly.
A greeting like the one you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that I have used such a greeting since childhood, that I had been brought up that way and that I saw nothing wrong with it.
For a chief, it was like a red rag to a turkey.
"You're on a socialist railway, and the only acceptable greeting is honor to work," the sullen chief huffed.
And besides, you're still confusing your superiors.
One time you say "sir" and the next you say "comrade."
But I am no Chief to you, but Comrade Chief.
The deputies are comrades deputies, the chief trackmasters are comrades the chief trackmasters!
Kindly remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but ... But I greeted you with a common civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and honor to work, or comrade ... Know... I'm not in the party ...
"It's not your advantage that you're not in the Party," said the chief coldly, calming down a bit.
However, we will talk about it later.
Anyway, remember that the chair upstairs is not prepaid for retirement.
That was not good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his advantage, it did not look good with the person.
He pierced me for a moment with a cold, prickly gaze, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his haughty name-calling.
He was only a few years older and played God, actually a comrade god.
Jovial, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, as he saw fit at the moment.
To him they all scolded.
So be it, he's the chief.
Actually, not all of them, the chairman of the party organization referred to him, as well as all party members, but also non-party members.
But the chief touched many, especially those to whom he could assert his superiority.
Right now, he wiped me out for complete.
I thought something about his ass and it took me a lot of effort not to shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the pickaxe, let alone continue to work as a railway clerk.
What would I feed two kids on?
And a house under construction!
I was crying, but I controlled myself.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," the chief ended the audience, and began to look carefully at the paper he had in his hand again.
At eleven-thirty I was summoned.
Everyone from the office was already there and when asked what and how, they replied that yes, that it would be good.
Only Jojin bitingly said, as was his custom, that they could not throw us all out, because the work would have to be done by Comrade Chief alone with his loyalists, and that there was no danger.
He emphasized the word "comrade," as if he knew what the old man had wiped me off for in the morning.
There was a nice gathering in the chief's office.
Comrade Chief behind his desk and at the long consultative table other comrades who were to decide on my officialdom or non-existence.
A cadre, a chairman of the ROH, a personnel clerk, a special purpose officer, something like a military officer, and a deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the shrew.
An ordinary track worker, tamping sleepers or throwing gravel with a pitchfork.
But also a former guard.
It was rumored that back then he wasn't any fun, apparently a nice beast.
Evil tongues claimed that he had gone to school in the seventh grade, had not learned anything, knew nothing.
And when the prison was abolished, he ended up on the pickaxe.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief motioned for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an unswallowable cone in my throat.
The cadre read the opinion of the civic committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two children and so on and so forth.
So far so good, I thought, and I was breathing better.
Then a report from the street organization of the party.
He copied the opinion from the citizens' committee, perhaps both of them were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents, long-time members of the party, refused to appear before the vetting committee and subsequently resigned from the party, reportedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The cadre officer noticed this and stopped reading.
The chief motioned to continue.
It only got worse from there.
I was a member of the SSM municipal committee and there I was promoted as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who left the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and besides the national committee, I also had my wedding in a church.
I have failed the confidence of the party in the worst way.
That is why I was removed from the ranks of its candidates.
But it wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even when she died, I arranged a church funeral for my mother, even though she was a former member of the party.
All this shows a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadre officer finished reading, only the tapping of the chief's pencil on the table top broke the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
At the same time, I kept repeating to myself, "Communists - supermen, communists - supermen." What did I get myself into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could repair switches even without any checks.
But now?
The career of a railway clerk ended before it began.
Return to the platoon?
That probably won't work, the chief will definitely knock me out for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade discussed here?" the chief broke the tense silence by asking the cadre.
Well, according to the testimonials from a previous job.
Do you have it here?
The cadre was obviously not in a hurry.
Beads of sweat beads on his temples, blinking nervously as if he himself were being examined.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.
"Well," said the chief, with a hint of joviality that often harbinger a thunderstorm.
At first glance all praise, he graduated with honors, graduated from technical school, worked in piecework wages as a locksmith, met the standard on average one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essential is missing.
Where did you get that opinion from, Comrade?" he turned again to the cadre, who felt that things were somehow beginning to turn against him, and that very soon he might not even be a cadre.
Here the comrade gave it to me when I got in.
Was that enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to join the platoon," the cadre officer babbled.
And there are no testimonials, his was somehow extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were assigned to the technical post, this scrap of paper was enough for you," the chief said dryly.
The cadre man blinked nervously and had no way to answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss that later," the chief concluded, and the cadre was clearly relieved.
For now, he has stood his ground.
"Then what about you, comrade?" said the chief, turning to me again.
Suddenly, he tells me out, that's the end of it!
My eyes darkened, I was hot.
A torrent of reproaches and accusations followed, and I knew that I was the most vile creature in the world, deserving of not the slightest mercy.
That by foisting an incomplete report I had misled the comrade cadre officer, and I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I received it from a cadre officer in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element who, at the time of building real socialism, supports and even participates in religious obscurantism.
That there was a lot that I had done, or maybe would still do, and I silently prayed that it would end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care that I flew out of the mechanizer's seat.
I didn't care that they took the pickaxe from me.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for an enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of Comrade Chief.
"That would be enough, Comrade Chief," said the Party Chairman suddenly, emphatically interrupting the Chief's Levites.
Here the comrade made a mistake, a terrible mistake.
What a mistake, downright stupid thing he did!
But he had already received his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than to close the door to the side for a while!
In order to open them to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so well-read or did he parrot phrases from party trainings and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must be given a chance by us!
A chance to prove that he has changed.
And who is to give it to him, if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, admittedly, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to reform himself!
It is your party duty that no one can relieve you!
In fact, it is a party duty for all of us as well.
Here the comrade must see that the Party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman had finished, no one even looked.
No one expected such a turnaround.
Least of all me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief said icily, trying to take the initiative again.
If you had let me finish, you would have heard that this was the conclusion I was aiming for.
They all nodded their heads in agreement, but it was obvious that they didn't believe a word he said.
"So I was confirmed to be a separate care officer," I croaked as I returned to the office, and then started crying.
Luckily, except for the engineer Eva, everyone was at lunch.
She listened silently to my incoherent account of my fresh experiences, and in the meantime I calmed down.
When I finished, she asked if I would have coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she set the water on the stove and prepared the cups.
In the meantime, she talked about cadre practices.
How one testimonial, often full of praise, is given to a man, and another, in which there is all sorts of dirt, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but on a pickaxe, and so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He just cares where he would eat or drink what, and so it turned out the way it did.
"He'll get it from the old one," she remarked mischievously.
He certainly won't like it today.
Watch out for him anyway, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party chairman?
In fact, a far worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from a pickaxe having great power.
The coffee water began to boil and then the office was filled with the smell of just poured coffee.
I threw a sugar cube into the cup and silently stirred the hot potion.
Hopefully I'm out of the worst.
Now they won't fire me and the next checks are in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief will not easily forget today.
Published in the anthology LITERÁTI NA TRATI II. published by EPIKA
The symbol of the village came to life.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is spinning again after many years.
It can be seen from afar, because it is located on a fifteen-meter-high mast.
People from far and wide call it "fan on Chlum".
For the village with 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the village received on the occasion of the meeting of natives in 2010.
"We applied for a coat of arms and of course we wanted to have a fan on the emblem, everyone in the area knows it," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds us of the time when local people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Chlum representatives decided for a solution that was suitable until the mid-eighties.
In the village at the turn-off to Číchov they had dug a seven-meter deep well.
Three years later, the well was supplemented with a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into a reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by the company Antonín Kunc from Hranice na Moravě at a cost of 2,400 crowns," states a commemorative inscription on the ground floor fence of the mast structure.
After several repairs and falls of the wind wheel, the pump was used in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the fight for water began to be written: on that day, a new water supply began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump remained only a non-functional municipal symbol and a local rarity.
The landmark was put into operation at this year's meeting of natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlumský family decided to repair the wind wheel again and put it back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - reduced by half a meter in diameter.
The wheel was mounted on a mast, but it had to be brought down the same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the appropriate material and the bike could not withstand gusts of wind.
Then the Chlum landmark rested for several years dismantled under the roof.
Since June this year, however, the wheel on the high mast has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of natives, the municipality had the replica of the wheel modified and remounted it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel pumps service water from the well only into the overflow blind arm.
And over the summer we completely disconnected it, because there was little water in the well.
At least it was idle.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the wind wheel shaft from the pump in the suction basket again," Mayor Mašek explained.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel got into the municipal emblem, but it is the only village of this kind in the entire Highlands.
A similar element in the emblem is in honor of local technical monuments, for example, in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in the Vyškov region, in Kuželov in the Hodonín region, Partutovice in the Přerov region or in Police in the Vsetín region.
Nothing bad, but I don't know Lafata, admitted Tripoli mainstay Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like all in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-match press conference.
We were coached by Georghe Hagi at the time, it was unfortunate to lose.
I hope to score a goal now for Sparta.
The only difference is that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who has played 60 games for the Romanian national team, is a key mainstay of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the raids of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Spartan Hybš about the Greek duel.
And he partly suspects what awaits him on Thursday night.
I know Fatai well, who played in Astra, Romania with my brother Lucian.
I saw all their matches at the time.
"I know he's a very good striker, that's why he went to Sparta," Goian said.
He did not name other footballers of the Prague club, so there was a direct question whether he knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and the captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and aimed at the Czech journalists with a slightly reproachful look.
The baffled expression on his face signified, "Why are you asking me this?"
After a moment of silence, he began.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot as a team.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
Nothing bad, but I don't know anyone else besides Fatai.
The Spartans know that very well about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, you can say that he holds the defense of Asterasu, he is their organizer of the game," observed Sparta assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian may have had his best years, but he boasts a very interesting football resume.
At one time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City were interested in him, but from Steaua he headed to Palermo, Italy, he also played for Glasgow Rangers.
"We expect an aggressive and unusual style," says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European cups, fights for victory in the Czech league.
For me he is the favourite in this game, but we are playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in the room with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomas Kosicky, who is looking forward to the opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering listing on the Prague Stock Exchange.
Kofola should have a new headquarters in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to trading in the company's shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the Group's headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far within the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a factual impact on what is happening in society," says Daniel Buryš, Kofola Group's Chief Financial Officer.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's registered office, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to its listing on the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is finalising a securities prospectus, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding company's registered office and the related share transfers will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction with only existing shareholders participating in it.
Therefore, no shares will be offered for subscription to the public or to new investors under this operation.
"Any share offering to new investors would take place – if the company and its shareholders so decide – at a later date, either in Q4 2015 or Q1 2016," the company said.
The company has said in the past that any share offering could consist of issuing new shares or selling existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on stock exchanges in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the listing of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Czech Television's test of objectivity in its coverage of the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the coverage of the refugee crisis by the main Czech media.
This time the broadcast of the main news program of Czech Television.
And how did it hold up?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can play today's Czech Television broadcast Události.
About 80% of news coverage was devoted to the migrant crisis.
Except for the first minute, when Czech Television reported on the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and called the migrants' attacks on police officers euphemistically they ran out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current pro-migrant propaganda was already running - judge for yourself the titles of individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for NGOs that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as an opportunity.
Wandering of refugees - Czech Television consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee, not migrant.
What is striking is that Czech Television consistently uses only shots of small children and women in its illustrative shots.
At the same time, she herself stated in the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda unparalleled from communist agitprop.
I have to say that as a former journalist I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once got up to a prefabricated apartment, I soon ceased to be the only inhabitant.
Silverfish moved into my Umakart toilet.
Silverfish, insects with imperfect transformation, i.e., not undergoing the transformation from a caterpillar to a beetle and the young looks like an adult individual, only it is tiny and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me and I did not hesitate to kill them.
First manually and later chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some kind of blue crystals for their disposal.
I think it was called Zyklon B.
Or something else?
However, it eliminated them successfully.
Later I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with a kind of juvenalizer, which the ants brought to the nest, and he then did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can be replaced by another.
True, with fleas and bedbugs, I would probably not hesitate to aggravate my karma by killing them.
In our new home, my partner and I agreed that if the silverfish do not crawl behind our necks, let them eat the chips of fallen skin, some invisible eyelashes and so on.
Their peaceful existence was disturbed by a spider after some time.
He was a common kind of crook, who resided on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought it lived off occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he spent several years with us, we found out that he feeds mainly on silverfish and that he probably kept their number at a tolerable number.
By intimate regular contact at each need performed, we found out that it was a female.
We have witnessed a romantic courtship with a partner about a third smaller, carefully strumming the threads of the web so that he is not eaten before he reaches the desired copulation.
It went on for about three days when they didn't move and didn't respond to our checks.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider did not move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging around it.
They soon disappeared.
Part of it was eaten by their mother, part of it was that they ran away.
Even the female disappeared somewhere after a week.
Whether she went elsewhere or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the primeval inhabitant of the toilet.
For some time she watched our behavior cautiously from the ceiling, and by moving it under the toilet bowl, she evaluated our non-aggression as friendship.
The number of somewhat multiplied silverfish decreased again and the spider calmly watched its normal activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
Meanwhile, our daughter has reached an age where potty use has become a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated it, but the eternal pouring out of its contents has fed up.
We encouraged her more and more strongly to use the toilet.
However, the daughter found an excuse to maintain her habit in the spider, which she could see very well when wiping.
Our talk about seeing the spider did not take any luck in the house at all.
Crying and screaming, she forced her potty.
There was no choice.
There came a moment when the spider, in the interest of the daughter's developmental advancement, had to command.
It was up to me.
He was caught in a glass and banished over the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him like a friend, but I still felt disgusting after living together for so long, as if I was throwing out a relative.
We assumed that silverfish would begin to appear more often and begin to multiply geometrically.
Surprisingly, for a week or two, none of them appeared.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the spider had somehow grown them there, like the ants, that the environment of the toilet was not as favorable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first medium-sized pieces appeared, and they were teeming again.
I had to invent another theory as to the cause of their disappearance, and I discovered that their connection to the spider must have been due to the fact that if they did not see it, that it was hidden in some other place, and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection with their predator, and his rapid disappearance caused some kind of alarm reaction in them.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their sight.
They showed some light shyness, but they didn't react to waving their hands or making quick movements.
My daughter already goes to the toilet regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
It remains only to attract some spider again.
I am already sending my wishes into the ether and I hope that they did not give up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we would have to use Zyklon B.
The Ten Sayings of Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The statements of the brilliant scientist of the last century will probably never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to delve so deeply into everything that the product was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He became known primarily for his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic proportion.
We cannot forget his explanation of the photo effect or the idea of quantization of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complex for many that they prefer to use easy comparisons for a closer acquaintance.
However, it is not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find an ingeniously simplified form of explanation for this: An hour near your loved one seems a minute; A minute in a hot furnace seems like an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing these ten from his plethora of famous quotes, which literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
With the first one, I'm not so sure.
No amount of experiments can ever prove me right.
But only one can prove me wrong at any time.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the clutter on the table is a reflection of the disorder in the mind, then what does an empty table reflect?
I don't know what will be fought in World War III, but in the Fourth World War it will be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but none to resurrect it.
To know little is dangerous, and to know much too.
If I had an hour to solve a problem on which my life depended, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The world's hardest thing to understand is income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive myself for not mentioning Einstein's formula to the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula holds: A = X + Y + Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are awaiting changes worth CZK 1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that all four of them have been in the black this year," said Governor Stanislav Mišák with satisfaction.
The total profit of regional facilities is currently about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher reimbursements from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
This fact shows that after lean years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, construction projects are being prepared that together will cost almost CZK 1.5 billion.
The long period when we bought mainly devices is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them top health care cannot be done, explained the plans Regional Deputy for Health Lubomír Nečas.
They are looking forward to changes in all hospitals.
Builders will come to hospitals as early as next year.
In Vsetín, they are now selecting a supplier for a new internal pavilion worth almost CZK 300 million.
In Kroměříž they have a dialysis extension planned.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new intern to the central pavilion opened this year for about CZK 200 million.
And the Baťa Hospital in Zlín is waiting for the long-delayed construction of a new central reception and internal medicine, for which three quarters of a billion will be needed.
In all cases, these are fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," said the director of the hospital, Věra Prousková, about the construction of the Vsetín internal medicine department.
The five-storey building should be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal medicine and neurology, dialysis, new outpatient clinics, beds and an intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which will be particularly noticeable to patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, they have only one toilet on the floor, the beds are non-adjustable, the windows leak and the health workers do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our internal medicine was built thirty-five years ago and now it is at the limit of its lifespan," pointed out the director of the Zlín hospital, Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected to the emergency room.
Doctors and patients will have all acute departments in one place, moreover in new premises.
The same model has already been half finished in Uherské Hradiště.
Central income is already standing and within three years it will be added to the intern.
"We will pay for the construction from a loan and partly from our own resources," explained director Petr Sládek.
This hospital is the only one in the region that can afford its own financing.
Its profit is still the highest and it did not make a loss even two years ago, when the Zlín hospital faced a loss of almost two hundred million crowns.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we are increasing revenues and we are effectively managing costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Patients of the Kroměříž hospital will also see improvements.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go into repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the sobering-up station will be completed, then the dialysis extension will begin, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance imaging.

No one has explained to me how I should keep the accepted refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complained after a meeting with his European colleagues that other states are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but refuse any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic, since they do not want to live here anyway.
"We did not receive an answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you came up with at the meeting of the European Union Interior and Foreign Ministers?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot speak of migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, they are going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we would be able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine it.
We did not receive an answer and therefore wanted quotas to be removed from the final text.
We have no problem with the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things.
We have been talking about this for a year and we say that this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago we were dealing with forty thousand, now it's one hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, get asylum in our country, have the ambition to come to us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't really want to come to us, but we have already committed to accept fifteen hundred people.
Would it not be possible to accept more of them in this way?
We have committed to accept 1500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even with those 1500, it is a matter of 1100 people coming with whom we will arrange the asylum procedure.
They will come to our detention facility and we will treat them the same as those we have captured.
It is a big question, and we will discuss this with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece or Hungary.
Because Europe's treatment is that if they have registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement, which is not yet in place, it may happen that we will not even keep the 1100 on the territory of the Czech Republic and they will leave for Germany after their arrival.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will handle the asylum procedure with them.
According to European statistics, if they are citizens of Syria or Eritrea, almost 98 percent of them receive international protection.
Then they will be given documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will be resettled.
This is the second project that is still under way, and we have only progressed there in discussing with the churches the possibility of helping them find employment, accommodation and so on.
But that's a very long run.
You said that at the ministerial meeting the other states were not willing to discuss with us.
But is it not the case that the Czech Republic is only rejecting quotas, but is not offering any solidarity step that would unblock the discussion?
And what exactly do you think this should be a step in solidarity?
If the Federal Republic of Germany issues an incentive that all migrants from Syria can join them, then the news will spread in a matter of hours throughout all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey and Jordan.
It encourages another wave of migration heading to Germany, because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - simply to discourage the migration waves, to help those in need, and to separate economic migrants.
To make it clear to them that they have no chance.
Last year alone, fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's offices.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them, or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, then fifty percent of what the social systems spend on them today in vain could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far should it go to tighten border controls even further?
We were afraid of being caught in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacancies in brick-and-mortar detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do this as standard.
The Austrians are the only ones who are taking these people away from us, with Hungary it is difficult and the Greeks - this is a completely useless story.
So where is the tipping point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three consecutive days will exhaust our capacities so much that crisis plans will begin.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in contact several times a day on the phone.
If this situation arises, the government can de facto sit immediately and by one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police with the army, let's say the customs administration, or the prison service.
The extreme option is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can get that far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have a Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarm.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost not at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of its debts at the last minute.
In doing so, they are trying to prevent bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid its debts.
Footballers also got their money.
Football Slavia stood before the court for the first time on Tuesday due to insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after Online Services from Pacific Samoa filed a petition for about 20 million crowns.
Slavia's lawyer Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours that she should not declare Slavia bankrupt.
And it must be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the new owner of Slavia became the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently money arrived at the club from the new owners, and at the last minute.
This is evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vršovice club sent tens of millions of crowns owed on Monday, just a day before the court hearing.
"Everything was paid between 11 September and 15 September," said Slavia Mládková, a lawyer.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak representative Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Mario Lička.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexander Losenicky.
On Friday, the club also paid the outstanding fees of the Prague 10 City District.
The insolvency dispute thus de facto remains only the receivables that Slavia disputes.
Either the obligations have not arisen at all, according to the club, or they are being litigated.
However, we are prepared to pay the amounts if we lose these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can prove with an account statement," attorney Mládková told the judge.
"Everything that was overdue is paid," Mládek said, adding that only undue or disputed liabilities are unpaid.
It is also certain that the judge will not rule in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had indeed paid the debts.
Subsequently, all evidence will be evaluated.
A decision can therefore be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the hearing to resume on the third of November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but in writing after it.

FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverter power supplies.
The combination of cutting-edge technologies, hardware and software integrated into the modular design brings benefits and a quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
And this can be done from welding structural steel to welding of special alloys, as well as from welding of coarse materials to thin sheet welding, from workshop applications to shipyard welding.
The incredible number of welding curves, simple set-up and expandability of the power source allow you to react quickly to changing requirements, resulting in reduced downtime, the need to change the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with state-of-the-art welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
No time is wasted and there is no waste of material or correction of faulty welds.
Flexibility is ensured, there is less downtime, more welding and higher profit.
It is this year's novelty, which premiered in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these honors because they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and parameter management, the FastMig X is one of the world's top.
For those interested, delivery times, which are around three weeks, are certainly pleasant.
We have already established the first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will certainly expand after the Brno fair.
We have been regular participants for more than twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before it," emphasizes Miroslav Streichsbier, manager of the Kemppi store in Pilsen on behalf of ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka could be built so that it would not fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
The blanka could also be minted more safely, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could have been built so that two soil sinkholes in Prague's Stromovka park would not occur, according to Alexandr Butovič, production director of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel.
He said this on Wednesday evening during a press tour of the tunnel.
However, according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
It will open to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and safety.
"The tunnel could have been driven safer, but the costs are growing exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the country collapsed just a few steps from where he began to excavate using a safer and more cautious method.
"If these measures had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovich said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the soil collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav director Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the Euro weekly.
According to the original plan, the construction was to cost 17 billion crowns.
If we add VAT, which jumped twice during the construction period, you have twenty-one billion out of seventeen billion.
When you add technology, land purchases and engineering, valorization and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is not that far from the 37, Belohlav said
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

FedEx Earnings Mixed, Cut Fiscal Outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the quarter and a huge cut in its full-year profit forecast due to low freight demand and higher ground costs.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's open.
FedEx says it expects earnings of between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The lowered outlook comes despite an average 4.9 percent interest rate hike in January. 4, and higher surcharges for the land transport of heavy or large packages, starting in November.
The company said it still expects earnings growth over the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenue and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "delivered solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The vacation hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same as they hired last year.
In a quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx raised $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings-per-share were $2.42, less than $2.44 per share, as predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping boosted the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the most recent quarter, ground revenue grew 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and custom insurance.
The express unit saw higher revenue due to higher base rates, while profit declined in the freight trade due to higher labor prices.
In premarket trading about an hour before the open, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the record set on June 11.
In their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve lawmakers will spend two days seated at Honduras' 27-foot mahogany table this week deciding whether it's time to raise a key interest rate after nearly a decade.
Towering over them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximize American employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor too close to a predictable decision to be announced Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is poised to be triggered in a near-zero short-term interest rate shutdown since late 2008.
While most of the data point to solid economic growth, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed into adding to volatility by raising its reference federal funds rate – by nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch in the first place," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them ample justification to wait any longer," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing nervousness in financial markets.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about a 30% chance of an increase.
That would point to a stock market decline if the Fed raises rates only if policymakers soften the slump by promising that no further hike is in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers would hold rates quietly this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now," he said.
If Fed politicians did that, "they would have to go to the extreme in their policy statement and hold the hands of financial markets so they wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that raising rates would reassure financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to raise rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects rate hikes this year through the spring and early summer, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of lifting.
And while inflation remains below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to convulse late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones' industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared that China's slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market has bounced back somewhat this month, and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% from its May high.
For Fed policymakers, the turbulent market situation gives them a comprehensive calculation of when to start raising the interest rate.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and the reports of weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple of weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on for the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere suggestion by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "narrow" their monetary expansion in the market triggered convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated movements in financial markets that seem inconsistent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting policymaker at the Federal Open Market Committee who pushed for rate hikes, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points over three meetings "Despite limited identifiable effects on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed the cuts.
The Fed should prioritize financial stability concerns only during a major recession like the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil is not even close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of a rate hike because the markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should come out on top.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's Chinatown and not Thai Quarter.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop that offers a stunning array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an automotive part if you need a bit of engine oil.
The shop is massive and it will take you over an hour to crawl through all the alleys.
If you're hungry from all this shopping, grab a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The indoor trade stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various supply points.
What's in stock: Need something - anything - Thai?
You can probably find this in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
Among the fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and bone you, even fry it for you if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to the massive freezer section, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter watermelon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter convenience foods, and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as single families and individuals.
The wide aisles accommodate shopping trolleys and forklifts.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where located: The store is in an industrial area of Los Angeles, surrounding the suburbs of Chinatown and downtown — a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own car park, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the shop may be busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
Speeds on motorways will remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies.
On selected motorway sections, it will not be possible to increase the speed limit up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the Chamber of Deputies made the decision when it acceded to an amendment by the Senate that rejected the speed increase.
The amendment to the Road Act will now head to the President.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto the law allowing one hundred and fifty kilometers of speed.
Transport Minister Dan Ťok (for ANO) was also against the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such speed.
Ťok supported the Senate version of the bill in front of deputies on Tuesday.
In accordance with the original government proposal, the approved amendment will now allow an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane roads.
The Chamber of Deputies first extended this option to motorways, which could be driven at speeds of up to 150 km/h in selected sections, but the Senate rejected it.
Members have now acceded to his proposal.
With the consent of the Minister of Transport, the senators also exempted from the amendment the right of the traffic police to have the last word in the regulation of local roads that are taken care of by municipalities.
The Senate version, which was approved by the Chamber of Deputies, also assumes that sewers, water mains or public lighting cables can be laid longitudinally under the road surface.
Municipalities would thus save on the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to look after road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the land in question.
The amendment should also help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to handle towed vehicles that the owners do not report to.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles that their owners do not register within a six-month period after notification of towing.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport through their territory on second- and third-class roads under the threat of fines for forwarding companies.
The amendment also abolishes the possibility to introduce electronic vignettes instead of the current paper ones, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money on the introduction of an electronic system.
The mayor of Ústí nad Labem goes to court.
He faces 10 years for overpriced welcoming citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced project Welcoming Citizens.
The police also wanted to prosecute MP Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her.
Depending on the legal classification of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The trial is currently scheduled for two days in October.
According to the state prosecutor, Mandík and Macik caused damage of at least one million crowns, according to the indictment.
The applicant relies on an expert opinion.
According to the applicant, the former members of the city management unjustifiably facilitated, by virtue of their function, the property benefit of the company that organised the welcoming of citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandík instructed the then head of the municipal department of municipal services, education and culture to address five related companies in the tender.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, the town hall cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator by the city and only Darothore applied for the tender, which was then awarded the contract by the city council.
The city paid out at least a million more.
Both defendants, led by the aim of securing for Darothore the award of a public contract for the organization of the Welcoming Citizens event in Ústí nad Labem, acted in a long-term and coordinated manner at least contrary to the requirement to proceed with due managerial care, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, they were aware that Darothore would charge Ústí nad Labem a price for the implementation of the Welcoming Citizens event, which would be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
In the end, the city paid out only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
According to an expert opinion, the amount paid out was overpriced by at least one million crowns.
Mandík has previously denied any violation of the law.
I have not committed any crime, I am innocent.
I don't understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, adding that the city under his leadership only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
From 2008 to 2010, the event was organized by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandik added.
Detectives originally wanted to charge Deputy Kailová, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it for prosecution.
Detectives have therefore dismissed the case in her case, but they expect to indict Kailová after her parliamentary mandate ends.
Welcoming citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift cheque for 5,000 crowns to buy baby supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police officers reportedly released a dog on the refugee.
Then they forced the journalists to delete the footage.
Hungarian police reportedly briefly detained an AP cameraman at the border with Serbia and forced him to delete footage of a police dog allegedly knocking a fugitive to the ground.
But the Hungarian government disputes this accusation.
The alleged incident happened Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border with Serbia through a cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
Police officers intervened against the refugees, and one of them attacked a Syrian man with a dog with a basket on his nose.
The dog threw the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a refugee," the man said.
The fact that the man was filming everything was noticed by one of the policemen and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was then no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Officers took Muzi to a dark spot near a refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
He was then ordered to delete the recording.
The man thus lost the result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The Associated Press sent a letter of protest to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
In it, she called the officers' behavior unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to worry about the government destroying legally obtained material.
Citing a police report, Kovács disputed Muzi's account of the events.
He said the officers just wanted the journalist to show them if they were in any of the footage, which he said they had the right to do.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to delete anything.
"Dogs can bark – they're trained to scare and intimidate a little bit, but they certainly don't attack," Kovács said.
Unpredictable Champions League.
A win at City will give us a boost, Juventus believe
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," City coach Manuel Pellegrini said.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team created many opportunities, but we had the ball on our boots for longer.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team conceded in a competitive match after a long 636 minutes.
Last season's finalist Juventus was in exactly the opposite position before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, they have only a point as the defending champion and with a score of 2: 4 they are in 16th place in the table.
That's why the turnaround at the Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three mainstays - Pirlo, Tevez and Vidal - before the new season.
In Manchester, they were replaced by Pogba, Manchukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, hopefully thanks to it we will ride the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we are there, we are one of the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attacking phase.
My players deserve this result.
"Before our equalizing goal, we could have conceded at 0: 2, but Gianluigi held us," Allegri coach praised goalkeeper Buffon.
"We burned some good chances," City midfielder Yaya Touré lamented.
We have to take the experience of the Champions League and try to do better next time.
Farewell Angela, goodbye to old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all the media frenzy around is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a moment.
Today, newspapers and media are full of children carrying their parents on the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this automatically creates in man - that is, in the European man - a sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, it's not just desperate babies who come here, notice in the footage of boats landing on the Greek islands that the children are not so visible!
And somehow, recently, images of ships heading to Lampedusa, refugees from the French border near Menton, by whose beautiful promenade thousands of young men are lounging, have disappeared from our television.
Mostly young blacks.
And also gone are the pictures from Callais, where these dark and black men are waiting to see if they can make their way through the Channel Tunnel.
I guess it doesn't move anymore.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans somehow did not make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
There was too much falsehood sticking out of it.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow concealed that it is not only about unfortunate children from Syria, but also about styled - for older: fashionably dressed - young men.
Whose musculatures look like they just came out of some kind of fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer in the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no hams.
And out of them came young black men.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They walked into the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes.
That this is a private beach did not interest them and the staff - Turks, Muslims! - were obviously afraid of them.
They occupied all the sun loungers.
Whoever was not lying on it and was in the sea was unlucky.
They were dressed like from an American rapper movie.
On the heads caps with a nail, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and started feasting.
They occupied the tables around, crammed into the swarthy and white bar diners sitting next to them - read Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers with children fled from the dining terrace somewhere quiet.
Incoming blacks drank beer straight from thirds - as in serials from the USA?! - on the beach they threw empty bottles around.
They were constantly yelling loudly at each other.
But it was not English.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight from bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies - in the water they screamed and screamed, mothers with children and pensioners fled in terror, and in half an hour there was not a single non-black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They were all gone.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice that evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't get it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had a massive cross of gold about twenty centimeters tall around his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are they drug smugglers?"
"You saw them drinking," replied the waiter.
They do not smuggle or use drugs.
They are smuggling something completely different.
So it was already clear to me what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105, it wasn't so important to me.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known first.
It doesn't seem to me that they don't know.
About 1.5 million immigrants left for Europe at that time.
And they go and go and go.
Today it has become clear that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and related lobby and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now a publicly recognised major force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, but also the top of the EU and television, including our own.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcoming of refugees in Germany are on par with Moscow television images from August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunbathers at the station, but mainly - Old German - Muslims welcomed their fellow tribesmen.
For weeks they babbled on the news on Czech Television about how according to some research, almost all Germans were in favour of the arrival of emigrants.
But anyone who has only been to Germany for a few days knows that this is a lie like a tower.
This is confirmed by other information.
For example, the famous public opinion poll organized by ARD - in Czech the Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, just a week ago, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees.
That's what our televisions were talking about.
However, they concealed what broke the next day in Germany: that the poll for the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want any immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago: "Our efforts at 'multi-culti' society have totally failed."
She went on to say: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All attempts at such coexistence have totally failed."
In a country of four million Muslims, she said, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has worked. Today they live here with us, and we lied to ourselves for some time that they would not stay, that one day they would disappear again.
But that is not the reality.
The multicultural approach, where we say that we just live happily next to each other, has failed.
He utterly failed.
But even Merkel probably does not have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
This is shown by the escalation of events.
The conflict is rapidly increasing.
The Euro-German Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, an SPD MP, the only one who reportedly does not even have a high school diploma in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play concentration camp guard from the minute - has demonstrated himself as he has done more than once.
It seems, especially under the impression of the latest statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that with the exception of some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have been trying, at least outwardly, for years to come to terms with their terrible past as an aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those right when they say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is sown in the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped with all his might the attempts of the Greater Germans to dominate the whole center of Europe?
When did he say that the Greater German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he should.
When it was shut down, preparations for WW1 began.
The idea of a Greater Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After the attempt of the Marxists to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis of, for example, ecology, which, by the way, was one of the main ideological doctrines of Nazism.
We would say sunshine.
The German elites had long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, so they left alone all those fighters against the atom, enthusiasts looking for paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who everywhere want to do something different and better, they have fully sided with the fighters against the warming of the planet, they have stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there has also been a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic current in this current, which considers all Slavs to be difficult verbež - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was a Jew, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements by Schulz and German ministers openly threatening disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leading Germany.
Which must be obeyed without question.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if we mix in the fact that immigrants are a very impressionable group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind this, as always, is capital, especially German capital, which it suits and which benefits from the fact that Germany, through the banks and the Union, actually controls most of the states of Europe.
The pseudo-belief of the sunbathers first led Germans into the swamp of environmentalism and multi-cturalism, and today it has brought and will bring home perhaps millions of Muslims.
Who, enticed by the siren voices, will soon hit a wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see and begin to rebel.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbours with force, once again it can become ideologically infatuated with part of its population - but, it seems, an ever smaller part - but eventually, as always, reality catches up with it.
Will Germany Burn Again?
Muslim hostels are already burning.
What will the German government do when public protests by Germans against incoming Islamists erupt?
Will Muslims who have long lived in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to adopt local customs and laws, come to their aid?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans who are watching the Islamization of their country in fear are engaged?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up to protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-superman Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict it has provoked in Europe by supporting its sun-loving ideology, that is, an elitist and essentially totalitarian ideology, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the rude treatment of disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, it cannot end well.
Completion tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of meddlesome sellers: scare them to death.
Just knock and the robust knocker will lash out at you in a way that weaker natures may not be able to withstand.
A living head will wipe you off nicely and drive away even the hardy, on the way away will accompany (or rather drive away) the insistent seller and the animated statue.
Perhaps it is a pity that the talking knocker can not be bought in reality.
Even in our country, it would be useful to chase away a lot of peepholes and scumbags.
Oxalis corniculata.
A tiny weed that tolerates a dry environment.
And so it is located among the outdoor tiles near where I live.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to expansive weeds, but visually makes a nice impression in terms of flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
She is unpredictable, she thrives in our garden.
She likes drier environments, is easily adaptable, modest and unpretentious.
Although she creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth observing and photographing further.
The beauty of the detail is still under scrutiny - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet while breastfeeding
The Brazilian Paediatric Society SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding by images of babies sucking from breasts painted with images of junk food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that supply infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Due to excessive energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake isn't the only dietary measure mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced their children's genetic makeup and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates even as Nine's tries to take the lead on The Today Show
The flight of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the costs of the escape of the Liberal leadership failed to create a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
Morning show Nine screened from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, as it averaged 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers on Today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling a gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there was an average of 318,000 in Today, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are having a good time, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning 800 Words debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson alone could pull off a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result gives a resounding 'yes'.
Seven's The X Factor retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, handily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven saw mixed viewership on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of Andrew O'Keefe's new TV quiz (5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 5:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half an incredible 720,000.
Hot Seats averaged 620,000.
With The Chase Australia's downgrade from the second night, Nine will be confident that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy – but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently figured out who would win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to The Bachelor is shrouded in an unsurpassed mystery.
And the three girls who stand still certainly won't reveal who the right one is, who will eventually get a rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they inadvertently told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut for Thursday's final
All three women lyrically praised why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, then which one gets Wood's final flower?," their answers could act as a spoiler about who would win the Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one who would be the best fit for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a light relationship from a certain day.
"From the moment I walked into the house and observed Sarah and Sam's energy, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so throughout the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's the right chemistry between them.
They feel good and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood could make a nice couple.
For her part, she says that during his last visits home, she realized that Wood might be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized this wasn't just a game anymore – I opened my whole heart to him now."
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can tell," she said.
I like both girls equally - it's a tie between Snowy and Lana.
Bachalor airs on Wednesdays at 7.30am on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams questioned after his great start to practice at the end of last year.
But Hayne picked the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which the Australian rugby league convert did on his first pitching kick-off in Tuesday's 20-3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he has confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and fill him in after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing the rookies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them on.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly in the post-match press conference.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received encouragement from the team's special coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and just worry about the next game.
During the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne made up for his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing as he walked off the field after a mistake and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a pass in his own goal area led to a Queensland three.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested while pointing guns on a Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts curtailed.
The Constitutional Court stood up for the emigrants who demanded compensation for their property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the pair turned to the state for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The court initially awarded them the required amount, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim so that it awarded them only less than CZK 90,000, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the price regulations of 1991.
The Supreme Court defended the emigrants and awarded them the originally sued amount.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the Constitutional Court with a complaint.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation awarded under the then valid legislation - although at that time it represented adequate compensation in relation to the confiscated property - now amounts to only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot be to the detriment of the interveners as beneficiaries in the restitution who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who did not have the opportunity to obtain compensation earlier," Judge Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk explained why the Constitutional Court took the side of the emigrants.
"The Constitutional Court has repeatedly expressed its support for general courts to proceed in restitution cases so that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation is always achieved, i.e. redress for property injustices caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA will now be played by Radka Fišarová.
By the way, Radka Fišarová became the world's youngest Evita when in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perónová in the first Czech production of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Timeo Rice at the Spirála Theatre in Prague.
On returning to the same role, he says: "To this day, the demands of Evita have not been matched by performances."
Evita is not only a wonderful role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended for the role of the First Lady of Argentina by Monika Absolonová.
I saw Monča in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Here I suddenly saw a completely new concept.
I'm quite a fan of more modern modifications, but this one is just particularly good.
"Ondřej Sokol's direction is original, light-hearted and contemporary," says Fišarová.
The imaginary handover of the musical sceptre between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolonová's Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 p.m. in the Studio DVA theater.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
The experience will certainly include the duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Quiet Your Cry, Argentino!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also take a break from the director's stand when he will replace Karel Roden in the role of President Perón during the filming of the film.
Due to the interest of the public, other dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by the Studio DVA theatre in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Directed by Ondřej Sokol, the main female role was originally staged by Monika Absolonová.
She is flanked by Karel Roden as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
Legendary songs from the workshop of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovský can be performed by a live orchestra led by Kryštof Marek, who participated in the first performance at the Spirála Theatre.
4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into crowds of protesters against a draft new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station, with some throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said police fired tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, it said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused the high number of deaths.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across Nepal's southern plain, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under a proposed new constitution and have tempered their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally controlled for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have sped up the process following a devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted on the provisions of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We certainly must not panic now.
After losing on the ice of the championship Litvínov you did not even manage a home duel with Sparta hockey players (3: 5).
Are you not afraid of a similarly disastrous entry into the extraleague as a year ago?
I hope that nothing like this will happen again.

NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of tropical cyclone formation forming in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL. O) said it was launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees flooding into European countries fleeing war-torn and poor countries. Google doubles each amount collected.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
The news was posted on her blog by Google employee Rita Masouda based on her personal experience fleeing Kabul with her family as a seven-year-old.
"We have travelled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masouda said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like mine are willing to help.
All donations will be distributed among 4 NGOs helping refugees and immigrants: Médecins Sans Frontières, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UNHCR.
Google said it would double all submissions made through the google.com/refugeerelief page to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing its largest wave of refugees since World War II. Most are coming from Syria, torn by a four-year war that has displaced 4 million people this year alone.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it's too early to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"Mortality data takes a long time to show," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an op-ed for a new study of JAMA surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proven effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most research has been done on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the relationship of weight relative to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a study collected since 2007, which looks at two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass and gastrectomy — in type 3 diabetes treatments for people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who did not receive surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes was resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially only in about 2 percent of patients.
Controls for blood pressure, trigycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol were also shown to be "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflects the body's ongoing blood sugar levels.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers report.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the drug-treated group, however, this figure remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" — which translates into better hemoglobin A1c levels — did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of surgeries.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved larger declines in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs. 2.1 percent), and were more likely to remission diabetes (46.9 percent vs. 16.7 percent).
While the new study doesn't show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent greater chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
While the new study didn't show an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone said it's a reassuring outcome for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This is where this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after a patient's BMI drops between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long to let people know the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think once you accumulate these genetic changes that firmly connect their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
A Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to the study of ethics, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that in the present circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable it was, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also addressed the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the violent U.S. response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush advising him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent way.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested a sanitizer in the last 4 years
Poison centers around the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who ingested a highly alcoholic sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of ingestings of sanitizers in children under 12 who were reported to poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Kids are getting these products more often, and unfortunately there's a percentage of kids who need to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitizer intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teens drinking sanitizer for cheap fuss.
The teens reportedly mixed sanitizer with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the attractive smell of the composition.
"Kids don't think it could hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive (sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitizers with the scent of strawberry, grapefruit or orange, which are very attractive for children.
The sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several elbows may indicate alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Toxicology Control Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey sit around either, but people leave these sanitizers outside, and when children get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested up to four sips of strawberry-scented sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered drunkenness in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered indistinct words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because she fell and hit her head over alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitation to be out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation agents have been linked to death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting a sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health professionals believed the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in upstate New York City planned to poison their "evil" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitizers and forbade their presence in the room.
Police judged the foiled plan as "innocent chatter," referring to the discipline of the school district.
Rumor: No discord in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays talk of discord at Celtic, while Deila admits the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he turns it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against an attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that the new signing from January will disrupt the unity of the team.
Dons extend their lead over Celtic by 5 points
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, giving the Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of discord
The situation sparked rumours of discord at Celtic, which were denied by Griffiths, who insists he and his team-mates are not working under any pressure from increased scrutiny in preparation for a match with Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bores Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer says Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic – as there is no longer any rivalry between them for the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax's ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands, they don't show the best of Celtic's games anymore, and why?"
Because the Rangers are no longer there.
The people here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Company matches and it is not only people from Scotland who watch these games.
I'll turn things back around for the good, Deila pledges.
Roony Dealia admitted that Celtic were stumbling a bit, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around again.
Defeat by Malm and subsequent dropping out of the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now sit at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says: "Celtic have had bad times and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about what's going on.
We are in exactly the same position - but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because they make the players so much better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton worries about January reinforcements
Despite comments made weeks ago suggesting he had already identified some of his January goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about buying reinforcements and insists he doesn't want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different to the summer one.
The players who come in in the summer have a whole pre-season to settle in, which you could see in our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer target hints at retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who has been linked with Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted that he could retire when his contract with Swansea expires.
The 20-year-old has had problems with a prone ankle for two years and has been unable to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA over comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on the defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by referee Collum to be called off.
Neilson stands by his claim, stating: "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastle
A stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting that he sang a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a tense moment," the striker said, adding: "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in a Celtic shirt."
Tannadica Council believes in Dundee United-Donelly management
Simon Donelly insists that Dundee United's board still believes in rectifying the situation with the current management of the squad - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes happy for 'ugly win' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to hold on desperately against the Hamilton Accies to secure their seventh consecutive league win and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes states, "There's no team that's won anything, whether it's cups or leagues, without winning that type of game."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged while overall UK unemployment rises
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK rate (5.5 per cent), according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in a three-month period, the number of workers has now stalled at 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scotland's Secretary of State David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It's been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In those 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has been rising while unemployment has been falling.
Why I Witnessed the Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will watch the killing of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the viewing gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Penitentiary and see Richard Glossip being executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who would witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approaches, I'm starting to get scared.
So why am I doing this?
I have accepted this invitation because I think it is a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than vacancies, a morbid lottery is conducted to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of jobs for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the whole execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends and have formed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that guy.
We often laugh when we talk to each other.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I will simply have to memorize all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have phrased it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the death penalty proceedings.
Kim Bellware, a journalist for the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
If you want more information about the case, please listen to the podcast series I created.
I will not repeat all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there is a high probability that he is innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that not enough evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is wrong.
It is from this perspective that I will watch his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a person I love die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Constable Canning Vale remained dry after extricating the man from Canning River.
A bet by a man from Pestru that he would run away from police failed after he got into shallow muddy water just yards away from a police officer who tried to persuade him to return to shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in an incident spilling over into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, 'I'm not going out, just come and get me,'" Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to wet his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic, namely police negotiations."
"Sometimes people try to do funny things while running away," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to stop the races
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria organisers of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He targeted the organisers and Racing Victoria's integrity department and believed they had a personal campaign against him with a late scratch on Lady Tatai during maintenance on race day, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what's best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin positive cobalt swab that he couldn't explain.
He bit his tongue over espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about the fact that I've been sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think that I am doing my best for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I would then have to consider what I would do with my license.
Earlier, Moody released a bombshell in his interview with racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man—whom I will name after the question—and offered him employment in my stables in exchange for finding out information about things that were done in my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because they have completely failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this becomes a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and make people outside of coaching positions take responsibility for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe they need to take away my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them food for thought.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will push them and put the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go away.
The coach's frustration levels have increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt including Lidari, and a recent scratch has made him feel like he "could put his license on the table."
Mood, best known for preparing undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the rule of treatment on race day "ridiculous" after a clay compress or mud was applied to the horses' feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it did.
It happened on race day.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for poultice treatment on race day, for which organizers have already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobram driver who drove away was arrested
Police have arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and drove off after the collision.
A cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on a major Murray Valley road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist drove off without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a fifty-year-old man from Nathalia confessed himself to Shepparton police.
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop in an accident, failing to render assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised his players' actions as "setting the clock" by two NRL favourites in the Premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said referees allowed Storm players to "wrest" his players during the Storm's controversial victory in the Sydney qualifier final on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennet made a lightly veiled remark on Strorm after his team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "showcase" of rugby league and saying two from Queensland were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' tackles, saying they focused on "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that this situation has boosted his confidence as his team is criticized by two senior coaches, which may mean they fear defeat from the Storm.
"It keeps coming — I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defensive system and techniques over the last year, we've just been emphasizing contact during tackles in recent weeks and that has been a turning point for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously coaches a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like that always come up at this time of year.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. She was also just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George being criticised for being a boring team and Wayne said at the time that he didn't care.
But now he has a squad that can play a style of play that he finds distracting, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
That's the kind of football you would want to play if you had that type of player available.
He said that in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football – but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more confident because they say things like that because they're afraid of the game against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they were getting to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that more goals were scored in the Storm vs. Roosters game than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos team's play was probably good, I didn't watch, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and not scoring attempts interesting?
To me, these are agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at some stage.
The Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finals next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail for drug charges
The man, who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that had been smuggled out of Queensland, was bailed at $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting the co-defendant at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse café, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of commercial-grade cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer based his defense on the fact that there was no evidence that he owned the entire amount and that he could have been in the café completely by accident and innocently.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan thought Maksimovic would flee.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the Crown case, he lied to police about where he lived.
Maksimovich's mother and stepfather jointly offered $200,000 bail for his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that the $200,000 bail deposited is a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts alone were clearly inadequate, as the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report daily to the police and observe a curfew from 6pm to 6am.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to lure paedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an eleven-year-old girl to obtain images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged on to her online chat, where he had a bunch of rude photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up to find her phone missing and then found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She went through it and found disturbing news before alerting her mother.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then analytical computers found the address and discovered "disturbing" searches on the web using terms to search for obscene images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers that his reason was to "seduce pedophiles" online before "pretending to be a police officer and scaring them."
Fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction – that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer search, but claims he just wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them
He claims it jumped over him while drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, he called his mother, she was shaking and crying.
She saw the obscene pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, who resides in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to filing a lawsuit for receiving or providing inappropriate images of children on June 14 last year, breached bail conditions on January 25 and failed to appear in court on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on a sex offender list because he could argue that there was "no substantial sexual overtone" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October due to the filing of a report by social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in the case but was held in custody pending hearings on other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a sex offender list before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but a video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament has also been tainted by claims by opposition lawmakers that they have received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his speech.
He was booed and provoked last month during his State of the Nation address to parliament — a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to obstruct Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that doesn't appear but is called 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save costs on business services to the business.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating its PC and printer business from its faster-growing business in hardware and services.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's CEO and chairman, who will lead the unit after the spin-off.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores that will help businesses transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing unparalleled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will break up a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a manufacturer of electrical equipment whose garage in Palo Alto has been dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to handle the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the second-largest PC maker and one of America's largest tech firms, is the latest in the sector based on the belief that a niche firm performs better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates need to get behind the injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason for him not to play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is sure to miss at least four more English Games and, historically, his involvement in another summer's European Championship is clearly uncertain.
The big shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong from an ankle injury and then regained his former form during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury is not a career threat," Wenger said.
It is a wound that requires healing.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he'd sustained before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger has admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
Here, too, an unpleasant pattern arises.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. chronicles 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he made his gaming debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played in just 65 league games out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for the Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs to miss the most days due to injury.
Wenger is embracing the potential of a vicious circle, but the arsenal believes improvements in recorded injuries over the past season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win a competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get out of this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he does and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal kicks off the Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb with matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the next Wednesday, and Wenger prepares to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal's Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also unbeaten in a total of 41 matches after maintaining their "unbeatables" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by a 3.2 magnitude earthquake on Wednesday night.
This was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks the arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remain far from the hope of leading the club to their first European Cup victory.
"The commitment is huge," Wenger said.
It never happened to the arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of such depictions in various shows is glaring, especially given how the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, which aims to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a high enough percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends represents half the chance of developing mental health problems.
But of course, for friendship to work, it must first be attainable.
In this communication via social media, with an emphasis on style and not the content of the message, an immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun-loving and more successful has doubled, even if we are rather isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; Money, image, social status, all at the expense of our true values – our personal desire for growth and friendship – which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire game creator recently explained, money really doesn't buy more luck.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stem from the realization that yes, men can also identify with it, even if they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me, "My role as a listener to people who feel depressed or suicidal really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel incapable of communicating with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that pops into my mind when I try to offer a longer-term coping mechanism.
It emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
As for my assignment, being an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support needs to come from closer proximity, from a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to Comedy Central's FrendsFest this weekend, why not take your friends out for a drink at Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned to celebrate.
Or when you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish — a full 236 episodes — for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored to help PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG beat Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a comfortable 2-0 final win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after his Champions League debut and the PSG player sent the French champions to victory, but they then threw away several chances before finally extending their lead when Cavani scored with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are not just focused on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their path to the quarter-finals, which they have recorded in each of the previous 3 editions.
But even though they picked up three points, it wasn't a classic performance by Laurent Blanco's team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasteful in front of goal and later substituted against his home team and the club where he began his illustrious career in 1999.
"In the Champions League it's not easy to win away or at home, so a 2-0 win makes problems for our opponents and looking comfortable in defence is a good start, although there are things we will need to improve as the season progresses," Blanc said.
This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of three changes to PSG, who suffered a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux at home in Liga 1 this weekend, but were overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger has been hailed as the man to take PSG to a new level in Europe following a move from Manchester United last month, and he showed why when he ran on Marco Verratti's pass behind the Malmo defence and sent the ball behind Johan Willand into the far corner of the goal with a beautiful finish.
However, anyone expecting this to kick-start PSG's spectacular victory, they must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs and reached this stage, started with 9 internationals in the starting line-up and five defenders and two retracted midfielders were a tough opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjic's shot that narrowly missed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in attack.
Instead, PSG robbed themselves of the benefits of the attack with poor passing and poor finishing that wasn't good even from Ibrahimovic, who failed to shoot five times in the first half and was disappointed afterwards when his shot arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half by Cavani.
However, he proved far more appropriate when it came to creating chances for his team-mates and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a spinning shot that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan sent a header over the line for the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed him after a pass from the left flank from Maxwell.
This put an end to any thoughts of Malmo about the possibility of them benefiting from the match and only a superb save from close range dashed David Luiz's hopes and the score remained unchanged even when substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was disallowed at the end of the match.
Malmo Age coach Hareide admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian saying: "Our last game in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a breathtaking match for them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion from Share Sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by the collapse in commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion on Wednesday from a stock sale as part of its sweeping debt-reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold around £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with a rehash of commodity prices as China's economic slowdown reduces demand and ignites sparks of doom across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore's share prices to the top of the London stock market in early morning trading on Wednesday.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the $2.5 billion share sale is part of broader plans to reduce its $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares at 123 pence a share, marking a 2.4 percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
They divested themselves of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Fears of a prolonged slowdown in Chinese growth have cut the price of iron ore by nearly half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement Tuesday.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner to be held after the talks.
"President Xi's visit represents an opportunity to strengthen U.S.-China relations and encourages cooperation in addressing issues in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for constructive discussion on the two states' differences," the report added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington before continuing to New York for the U.N. meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberespionage and growing aggressiveness in South China Sea waters.
How the refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency flare fired by Germany has far not cemented the European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, French daily Le Figaro reports.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the refugee problem first: it will systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they set foot on the Old Continent — particularly in Greece — rather than arguing over the future distribution of refugees by quota based on quantities that are increasingly distant from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, member states' interior ministers changed the priority.
Rather than worrying about the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who arrive today and resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential to manage migration," stressed a text discussed by ministers in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds itself in jeopardy in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its resolve and is increasing the pressure.
It is reinstating border controls, particularly with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those seeking asylum in the country.
The Central Power thus makes it clear that without it, no free movement in Europe is possible.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday already served as proof.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary did this a long time ago.
Such exceptional and temporary measures shall be permissible under Schengen rules.
That it is a domino effect, but he also sees blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy and also Hungary for those who have already crossed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is by no means new, but it is being implemented with difficulty.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived migrants have already been registered and identified with fingerprinting.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that it will be left with camps in which refugees would accumulate at its expense.
Greece remains the real black hole.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as recently arrived in Italy.
Most are genuine asylum seekers who came straight from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, has folded its hands.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and a source of now shared concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to introduce checkpoints as soon as possible, but has given no number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece extend to the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on that front.
It is therefore a question of deploying intervention teams from the European border control agency Frontex in the country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
In terms of law, Athens will continue to have the final say.
The question of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is getting close.
In any case, the new emergency situation of the twenty-eight has put on the back burner the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was raised by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see this as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in the text approved by a majority of the twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise is to redistribute 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed in June during a hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, three of them Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
Also of German nationality is a woman who was the only survivor of the affected group of eight, according to authorities.
Previous media reports said she was Polish.
A thirty-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury in the femur.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly in their forties.
"The rescue operation has ended, the bodies of the victims have also been taken to Briancon for identification," said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident happened around noon in the mountain area of Pelvoux below the summit of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins, measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said Nicolas Colombani, the rescue chief.
According to him, a huge amount of snow fell on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3900 meters.
The weather service did not warn of inclement weather in the area today.
Trpisovsky before the match with Braga: Finally the real Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský at his premiere in the cups managed to get through the preliminary rounds of the European League to the basic group with the Liberec footballers and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
Slovan will welcome 2011 finalist Braga at the start of the main stage of the competition and, according to the coach, wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout battles, where every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to your dream group, now we are there and we will play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal conceded, we can play our tactics and we are not tied to just a double match.
"I'm very much looking forward to it and it's a real Europe, before it was only qualifying," Trpisovsky said at a press conference.
He considers Braga to be a top team.
He will be very active, they have all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent may be more difficult because he does not have such a name, but he has a player in his squad who I think gave Manchester three goals.
"It's a great team at the level of top teams," Trpisovsky said.
But he does not consider Braga to be a clear favorite.
I take it that we play at home, so we are definitely not underdogs.
"I think that we have shown in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm it," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen out of eleven duels this season.
He believes that Liberec can impose its style on Braze.
We are waiting for a team that will be strong on the ball, but at the same time uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 formation with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, we discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the pitch," Trpisovsky said.
In the preliminary rounds we studied the opponent a lot, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we adapted to the training.
"And we definitely want, even though it will be very difficult, to play according to our notes," the coach added.
Student films dominate Písek, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries submitted their works to the competition of the 15th International Student Film Festival in Písek this year.
Forty of them, which a committee composed of students and teachers sent to the finals, will be screened from 15 to 18 October in the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be selected by an international jury, festival spokesman Jakub Charvát said.
Every year the festival has its own special theme, which is based on the festival trailer.
This year it's a detective story.
The director of this year's gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And, of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting student films - feature films, animated films and documentaries.
They will be judged by an international jury, including last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the festival organizers are preparing an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbochanson group Poletíme?, playful band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first one will be brought by Jana Ašenbrennerová, a graduate of the Písek Film School and holder of prestigious awards, including the one from World Press Photo 2014.
The second exhibition will show the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
Cameraman and documentarist Martin Čech will come to the discussion with visitors, Gerhard Gruber will accompany the silent film The Cameraman with his music, and the natives of Písek Brukner, Novotný and Hlach will christen their new book 3 friends from the town of P. S. Masaryk in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotný.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop common ties and film craftsmanship," the spokesman said.
This will certainly be helped by the Pitching Forum, where students can meet film professionals, attend several auditions at once and get a job.
The festival is associated with the establishment of the Private Film College in Písek.
Its founders, Vladana and Miloň Terčovi, organized the first edition in 1997.
Until the sixth year, it was held once every two years.
In the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency, insurance companies should pay the clients' claims in full.
Insurance companies should cover the claims of clients in the event of bankruptcy of a travel agency in full.
This was decided on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies when it approved a modified amendment to the Act on Business Conditions in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to the draft heading to the Senate for consideration.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay clients' claims even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the regulation, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insuring tour operators against bankruptcy if the amendment goes into effect.
However, the proposal is also criticised by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies have not paid full compensation are not Eurocompatible.
She drew attention to this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit, Šlechtová emphasized.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be feasible," said TOP 09 vice-chairman Miroslav Kalousek.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work, because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to close down or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
Tomio Okamura (SPD), a member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Travel Agencies, disagreed with Kalousek's concerns based on a survey among member travel agencies.
"Stop showing us the lobbying of insurance companies," he said.
Okamura does not consider the statements of the insurance companies to be relevant, and there is no official written statement to this effect.
However, they are finding out whether travel agencies will pay a deductible, which according to Okamura is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the rival Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about lubricating the stairs for Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
According to Fischerová, travel agencies will not be able to arrange insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer said.
Her motion to delete the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not come forward with a proposal to return the draft to the committee due to an alleged conflict with the Civil Code.
Filip drew attention to travel agencies, which, according to him, can endanger consumers.
Due to the Constitutional Court's verdict, the rapporteur for the bill, Martina Berdychová (ANO), withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance benefit would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not include the originally proposed minimum limit of four million crowns of insurance for travel agencies that offer air tours and the million limit for agencies selling, for example, bus tours.
The threshold will remain at 30 percent of planned sales of tours.
However, the indemnity limit will have to be such that it covers all customer claims in the event of the travel agency's bankruptcy.
Even after amendments, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to indicate which travel agency organises the package when selling tours.
Travel agents will have to provide insurance companies with, inter alia, economic and number of travel data before concluding a contract.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also envisages further regular information of insurance companies.
Travel agents will have to provide them on a monthly basis with data on the number of passengers and package holidays sold, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of advances and revenues for tours and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has not fulfilled any of its legal obligations towards the insurance company, it will call on it to remedy the situation or prohibit it from concluding new contracts if the breach of duty could endanger the interests of customers.
The amendment should also newly regulate the financing of the Mountain Rescue Service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the Mountain Rescue Service on the basis of its application, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial plan of expenditure and an outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, however, the proposer of the bill did not think through the situation of what would happen if the insurance company terminated the travel agency's contract.
It will not be allowed to organize tours and clients who bought the package before the cancellation of the insurance will lose it, according to the association.
In this case, the travel agency will suffer a significant loss and may even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good shape.
One of the ways in which travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be to sue the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and take advantage of much softer conditions abroad, and then we will only act as agencies on our market, said Jan Papež, vice-chairman of the association.
According to him, the draft amendment also contains the institute of a bank guarantee, but it is so ill-considered that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because a bank guarantee cannot be for an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the association, changing the existing practice is de facto unnecessary.
In the next two years, the entire law will have to be revised again in view of the new EU directive.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies currently operate on the Czech market.
This year, only three travel agencies have ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth about twenty billion CZK a year.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with German state premiers.
At the same time, it again appealed for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the member states of the twenty-eight.
We must do more to help the countries from which refugees leave or stay after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will work for dignified conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said, according to which such a signal could also be increased financial assistance or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"The federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis among European countries," Merkel said.
Brandenburg's State Premier Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expects genuine solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among others.
Merkel and Woidke also called for speeding up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible whether they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the Brandenburg premier said.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees is used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
More teachers will be needed for refugees to master German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if we manage to integrate refugees, they can become an asset for us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted Afro-Afro-Ametic filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying it wasn't necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's HBO episode of Project Greenlight, the actor cast interrupted Brown when she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives on the black protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie and not casting a show," Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted indignantly with disbelief and sighed, "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about the Martian went on the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with joint producer Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to relate to the character of Harmony," Brown said at the outset.
The only black character who is a hooker who is wrapped up by a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People pushed finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted that directing them "might end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disharmony with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at writing the clip, "Matt Damon was talking to the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE it hurts."
The tweet has garnered more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comment comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the killing of teenage Michael Brown by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took on a national effect, pressuring lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince alluded to the movement while introducing nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Similar to books and black lives, albums are still important.
Most recently, the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement made a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
Damon was recently reported to a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has its first winner"
Professional mountaineer and piccolo Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, taking home one million dollars.
In the competition, which had just finished its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During this season's finale, two men made it to the final round, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb on a rope more than 220 m long.
Britten was the first to climb within the set limit, becoming the first competitor to overcome the grueling 4 leg in American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero beat him by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview to E! News was right after his hard-earned victory, and it was clear that he was still in shock after winning the $1 million grand prize.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac told E. Smith. in response to your winnings.
"So suddenly... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed interviewed The Hollywood Reporter about the finals and why Britten won't get any prize despite becoming the first contestant to finish the course.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who completes the track the fastest.
"If there are more competitors on the track, the winner will be the one with the best time," Weed said.
Even though winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he harbors a grudge.
He is glad that he managed to achieve what he has done.
He received a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and loves his family.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife."
Geoff told me, "If there was anyone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I had won, Isaac would have felt the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with its eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers passed the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the park.
The Tigers, one of baseball's best teams, are currently in last place in the central division of the American League.
The Tigers narrowly averted defeat by beating Minnesota 5-4 at Target Field in Tuesday's game.
The Twins missed the chance to get closer to the Houston Astros and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Even if only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z that was so elusive to them during the second half of the season.
"Winning is always fun and it doesn't matter which way," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive lead and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings and then took another in the sixth and ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) allowed his opponent 6 1/3 hits and 3 runs.
It was only his third successful game in the last nine games.
"I want to finish this year with convincing results," Simon said.
"It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of a game when you're often on the bench and that's why I want to get into the game properly."
Tigers batter Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 runs and his first pulled point since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-point game since last game in June, in which he scored four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned into it nicely," Ausmus said.
"He looked good in training, batted noticeably better and managed to carry that into the match."
With three runs at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had the best chance to get back in the game.
Center midfielder Byron Buxton won the inning thanks to two points on the left side of the court.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks scored a point with a set bat and Simon chased Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent, Mauer, and had batsman Miguel San in front of him, who hit the ball and ran two bases, leaving right-hander Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on base and a chance for a draw in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send the third baseman over two bases.
Plouffe has already made 27 runs over two goals this season and tops the league table.
Detroit held on to the ninth inning, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon scored 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, the right-hander knocked out San on three pitches.
Detroit took advantage and scored points on Phil Hughes' play.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a retired right-hander who came into the game after more than a month's break due to inflammation of the back muscles.
"I certainly didn't have imagined a start like that," Hughes said, "but during the third inning I felt I was doing better pitching."
After withstanding the onslaught in the first inning, Hughes dropped one point to sophomore sweeper Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for right fielder J.D. Martinez earned Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all bases.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 streak.
Third sweeper Nick Castellanos followed with a point to the right side of the court and scored with another run, but Victor Martinez was tipped over when he tried to run to third base.
The Tigers added in the second inning when pitcher James McCann and fielder Anthony Gose scored two and one points to make the score 3-0.
"That brought us to our knees," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won on pitches, finished the third inning without a score and was replaced by right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three bases, grabbed six hits and 4 hits.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' right pitcher, ended the game with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be cared for by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a strained shoulder muscle, is expected to play in Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return from injury and play against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was traded for left pitcher David Price, he has a score of 1-1 after 4 games.
However, he has not played since August 20 due to a strained muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third head-to-head game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up economy to wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group tasked with Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said of the 16th session of the central leader of the group to deepen overall reform.
Promoting opening up to emerging reforms will give new impetus and vitality, as well as provide new scope for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, a relaxation of border control policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital, and the reorganization of the resident registration system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up in which sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits will be identified.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programmes.
The move is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also relax controls on the powers it delegates to firms, and make sure that the firms themselves decide how to run their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open up a state-controlled industry, more areas will be opened to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or "green card" by optimizing requirements and simplifying the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
New inpatient wards may be established in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of inpatient departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
However, there are also possibilities for expanding care in the region.
For example, one-day surgery centers could be established in the departments of surgical departments, where surgical procedures that do not require hospitalization longer than 24 hours would be performed according to the set concept.
It is not yet clear in which specific hospitals there should be one-day surgery clinics.
At the dermatology department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser center could be established with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the establishment of an apallic center that would care for patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anaesthesiology and resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Ostrov hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity that seems to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region are aftercare beds, especially the beds of the Long-Term Patient Hospitals (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should be closely linked to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should function as rehabilitation beds and part as classic LDN beds, the concept recommends.
As he points out, aftercare beds are mainly lacking in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
There could be used abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary Region there is a lack of social and medical beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
There is a shortage of these beds throughout the country, so it could serve for other regions as a so-called Alzheimer center.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, for which European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will follow the fields of supespecialized care and will form a space for the transfer of patients after the procedure, for example, after cardiac surgery, neurosurgical, transplantation or other interventions," describes the regional concept of inpatient care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
