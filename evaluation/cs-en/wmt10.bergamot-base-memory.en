Barack Obama to receive Nobel Peace Prize as fourth U.S. president
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and cheque for $1.4 million will be given, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The White House chief of staff will fly to the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife, Michelle, and will be busy.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee, selected by him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then have a scheduled meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will accept the prestigious award.
He will win it as the fourth U.S. president, but only the third to win the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he realizes that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He increased the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which he will not forget to highlight any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to put them on charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a particular charity.
The busy schedule will then take the president to a banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, there will also be a prime minister and 250 other invited guests.
From the beginning, Obama was rather restrained in the price.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also reiterated several times that it is not just a price for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "call to action" for him.
Conservationist accused of extortion
The Litoměřice police have accused the chairman of the civic association, the Society of Conservationists, of blackmail.
In several cases in the past year, he referred to some construction proceedings, for the withdrawal of the appeal demanded money from investors for his own benefit, said the police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Conservationists is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
The sorting containers don't smell much of Brno
In Prague, ordinary people can sort packaging from drinks, in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There, to reserve a few minutes before you find suitable garbage cans.
I don't want to say that the waste in Brno was not sorted at all.
But it seems to me that the fact that we are the second largest city in the Czech Republic is not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest league of waste sorting not only because, as citizens, we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into sorting containers, but above all by the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a PET bottle in the center?
It's a finished kumst, especially it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far is on the Moravian Square opposite Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think that's a hell of a thing.
Not to mention that in other parts, the sorting of waste is no honey.
Many of my friends prefer not to sort the trash.
Out of laziness.
It's far from the garbage cans.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw away some glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kounicova Street, I didn't see any colored garbage cans in sight.
Fortunately, on the way to the shalin, I came across the right place.
But the garbage was overflowing from it.
It is still the center of Brno, which perhaps represents the city the most, right?!
But the ecology and some aesthetics of the Brno socialists are probably not very interested.
They would rather buy the city a hockey extraleague, which will embarrass us all over the country, rather than buy a few extra containers and offer to sort other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that after a while of browsing on the Internet, I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is the worst in the whole South Moravian Region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money for both pensions and sick leave
After the left has added, despite the government's opinion, farmers or officials, the budget may not include money for pensions, sick pay or building savings.
But also on interest on the national debt or international litigation.
It will put problems for those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for the increase to certain groups, they relied on the government to borrow from sensitive expenses, pensions or sick pay. "It's just putting off problems for the future, laying mines," Janota says.
The borrowed money is increasingly paid interest and sometimes has to be returned.
There's not much to choose from, where to take it, the state.
If it does not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, it must raise taxes.
To all those who have now been added by the left: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later their children.
Pensions or sick leave, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not have to worry, they get them.
However, at the cost of becoming more in debt – next year will not be missing in the coffers only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity, as the government has done in its anti-deficiency package.
Due to the transfer of money in favor of several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year for the completion of highways and railways.
These are mainly already competed and unfolded sections that cannot be redesigned and possibly cheaper.
At most, preserve, which is also not free.
It means the delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, the drawing of European money is also at risk, warns Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed that the loss of money will be solved in Solomonic – it will reach into the dividends of ČEZ, which the state mostly owns, and from them it will add a transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and certainly not a bottomless source.
Last year, 18 billion came from ČEZ to the budget.
Every year, dividends are paid for by the liquidation of environmental damages, supplemented by a pension account or served as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
Moreover, under EU rules, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, the carnival of the transfers does not end there.
Nearly three billion have been cut in the budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or for spending on litigation, even for building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is not certain.
That's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing from the already launched two-billion-dollar project of the Treasury, which is supposed to allow online to monitor what individual authorities spend on.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
Americans are counting on a mobile phone in the future, on which the user will at the touch of a button switch between different operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you can transfer from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is exactly the possibility of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at one and the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first shown a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualizing smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which was also run next to the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is underway.
Now VMware is working with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains is bothering hoteliers
The bare slopes do not only worry the Krkonoše lifters.
The missing snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a large number of visitors on our website.
People are going through offers, finding out prices, but so far they're afraid to order bindingly.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this Christmas will be in the snow or on the mud," said Martin Jandura, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want a New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to your wishes, you should no longer hesitate with the order.
Anyone who prefers to save money and the quality of accommodation is in second place, can still try to wait a few days.
So far, Spindleruv hoteliers are offering only a week's stay on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to turn them in for a while, but then they'll allow and they'll go for a shorter time.
And then the rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates are still offered by the Vrchlabská travel agency Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
Half of the seats in our offer remain free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays,” said Petr Schiefert, Ingtours’ director.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still offer the Vrchlabská travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fortnight of February is also good for sale, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if they attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also be sold out," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, it is slightly better than last year to occupy the rooms of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're about five percent better.
We have the last few places for New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is a great interest in the Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well," informed the director of the best hotel in Peck Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the New Year's Eve stays are also occupied by the Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain available in the newest Jansko-Span hotel for Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which we already have occupied at the moment about sixty percent.
February is a little weaker so far, but as soon as snow falls, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will definitely increase, said the director of the hotel Omnia Erik Sporysch.
However, for a larger amount of snow, the Krkonoše hoteliers have yet to get their taste.
It is supposed to cool down on Thursday, if there are any precipitation, so there should be snow in the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, informed Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec Králové office of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical with what schoolboy's efforts Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats on the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it through a copycat from Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text, but he did not hesitate to even use the name of Bush's statement of January 2007 as the title of his own declaration: "A New Way Forward."
Three years ago, he criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq plagued by civil war as an “irresponsible and, in its consequences, catastrophic decision.”
But the ensuing months have shown that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field commanders, was the only possible and highly successful strategy that Iraq is not talked about at all today.
It did not improve Bush's reputation, but objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes a miracle will be repeated.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House despite the subordination habits.
He asked 40 thousand men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't fall for anything better, so at least he tricked the general by 10 thousand soldiers.
He managed to wring out the promise of another 5 thousand from Europe, although he himself originally counted on at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end the process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that the half-height increase will give the same fruit as the advance in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-ordered, its leaders honoring the deal.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied upon and no agreements are being adhered to.
In these conditions, Afghan security forces are preparing badly, accustomed every day to changing the master according to how it suits them.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a potemkin village, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of the interests of the various ethnic groups is extremely complex given the lack of clarity of the circumstances, which further complicate Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the construction of an "action-capable state," which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, doesn't look very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is striking with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent into the tumult of war for the purpose of "early return home" will cause a miracle done here, only a truly romantic soul can be truly romantic, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, determining the date of withdrawal of troops is a pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will see this as an indirect granting of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is coming to a minus.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their constituents how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the Hindu.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the intensified sanctions on the Iranians do not impress, there will be an overwhelming question before the United States whether to try to solve the problem by military force.
It will be necessary to answer it at a time when, according to Obama, America will proceed to a winning withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election, and therefore there is still plenty of time left to come up with another strategy if this proves to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives no longer get cash rewards
Senior executives at US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which responds to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading executives will get shares instead of money that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
Moreover, shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is pushing for Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under criticism after putting aside nearly 17 billion dollars (nearly 300 billion CZK) in rewards for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of rewards in the company for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20bn despite the measure announced today.
With the advent of the financial crisis, high rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to burden bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds (roughly 712,000 crowns) with a one-off 50 percent tax.
France is also taking similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines except physics
A record five women took over from King Carl XVI of Sweden in Stockholm today. The gustafa of this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müllerová was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The award for chemistry went to Israel's Ada Jonath, along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to clarify the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last laureate was the Nobel Prize in Economics, awarded to American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for her analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
The award was awarded today by scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of fiber optics, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each awardee received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of winning a financial prize.
For each category, it reaches ten million Swedish crowns (about 25 million CZK).
If there are more honored in each of them, they share the reward with each other.
The most traditionally anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to US President Barack Obama in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, because he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, he is at the forefront of the country, which is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defending his policy, he added that wars are necessary in a certain situation to win peace, even if the price for that is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduardo Janota on Friday morning, who is considering remaining in the government because he disagrees with the shape of the state budget for next year, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is anticipated that the budget and possibly Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was reported by the president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota plans to hold office on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus will now get for signature, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, the House approved the left's proposals for money transfers and increased money for the salaries of civil servants, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has accused the Social Democrats of covertly increasing the budget deficit.
There was a sharp internal political dispute between the left on one and the government, Klaus and the right, on the other, because of this, a question mark began to hover over the further action of Fischer's official cabinet, the formation of which was agreed in the spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the package of austerity measures that the Fischer government pushed through in the autumn and that it said was supposed to stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget bill, said at today's discussion breakfast with businessmen that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" that is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
Today, according to him, he no longer has a good solution.
Improvements could only be brought by a strong government, which could also lean on a broader consensus of political parties, the president said.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget was scary and the government should consider continuing to exist.
Petr Nečas, the deputy chairman of the ODS, told the Czech Press Agency that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called similar words "strong statements."
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, responded to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit that the former Topolánek government has prepared for this year and which will exceed 200 billion crowns is terrifying.
On Wednesday, the CSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The people were also satisfied.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, about its struggles and victories despite some criticisms that the lead roles are portrayed by American actors.
The story tells of sport, racial circumstances and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, in his life story, is represented by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said ninety-one-year-old Mandela asked him if he could portray him in Eastwood's film.
Another important role in it is played by Matt Damon.
I said to him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won an award for his role in Eastwood's billion-of-the-way boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the slave-abolition movement, who eventually became a slave, a fictional US president and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work for ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.
Invictus is the Latin word for the undefeated and it is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernesto Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. President-elect Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes he can bring his people together through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story on the screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role to bring it closer to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was for me to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, to dine with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I press your hand, I take over your energy, it transfers, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
The big surprise for him was finally when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the house bell, he opened it for me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite distinct differences in the characters of the actors compared to their true originals under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus has received: Undefeated Positive Reviews and is also talking about Oscar ambitions.
The film's critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his review in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of the positive ratings.
The secret of the glow over Norway deciphered: the Russians tested the missile
Above Norway, it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday that it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again a failure, and the missile, referred to as the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the tests of the rocket did not have the proper effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava usually did not take off at all or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already written about as "a rocket that does not fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th attempt was normal at first.
It was not until the end of the flight that the apparatus was again damaged.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed below the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows you to fire a vessel that is in motion and submerged at the same time.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed a broken "Bulava".
From the very first moment, the Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are fighting back this time, arguing that we cannot speak unequivocally about failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident affected the third.
In previous cases, the engines malfunctioned in the first instance.
Although not a single test launch took place without a mistake, only six of the thirteen of the Ministry of Defence consider it unsuccessful.
Therefore, the almost fifty percent success rate is filled with optimism by the generals, and so he still claims that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that he will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear units with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signs one-year contract at CSKA Moscow at 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will again be presenting in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably play in Friday's KHL match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljash got injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formalities, the Associated Press quoted the coach of the Moscow club, Sergei Nemchinov.
It is not yet clear whether the famous hockey player's comeback will only cover one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to the AP, Fetisov will become Russia’s oldest professional hockey player in the event of a return to the ice.
In the NHL, he played the legendary striker Gordie Howe for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic golds, seven world champion titles, and won the Canada Cup and the World Championships.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup in a Detroit jersey.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai complied with the unions. Cancels all overtime
The management of Hyundai, Nošovice, has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the often ordered overtime that the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to agree with the unionists on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign to our production plan, which is essential, therefore voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, Vaněk said.
News server Sedmička.cz reported that the company of employees who work Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 Kč.
People will get it back and for the working Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaněk, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated for overtime.
They either have their overtime surcharge reimbursed or they can choose a spare holiday on December 28, and thus extend the Christmas holidays by a day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees of Saturday's shift will get a paid fare and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and pressing point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists, as well as protesting employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees of the carmaker were forced to work two hours of overtime almost every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the deal, the unions will call off the strike emergency
Further negotiations between the automaker's management and union workers are due to take place on Friday morning.
The union chief, Petr Kuchař, said on Wednesday that if they agreed to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the automaker escalated last week on Wednesday, when roughly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management opposed that overtime must be done by employees to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
The unions, in their Monday announcement of the strike alert, also demanded that no sanctions be punished by employees who suspended production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the unions are demanding that the company ease overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5000 crowns this year.
Nošovice car manufacturer Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The company started production last November.
By September this year, it had produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity being 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on 'hardy' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound does not affect the common variant of the virus as strongly as some already available drugs.
AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of the multiplication of the virus results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are already ineffective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Technology in Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarbons act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV.
Metalcarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘enhanced’ compounds prepared based on knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metallocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resilient virus
HIV protease is a protein of HIV that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by the cleavage of HIV, mature infectious viral particles would not have been produced.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, researchers describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain that is further systematically altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIV protease substances has been tested in a test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications make metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
A fight over the budget. The ODS has embarked on Fischer, who is fighting back
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, described the approved budget for next year as "frightening" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider continuing to exist.
The ODS statement was described by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He said he was taking the time to analyze.
Petr Nečas, the deputy chairman of the ODS, said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely in the Chamber on a minority that is struggling with the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas pointed out.
On Wednesday, the House adopted the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments worth more than 12 billion crowns.
The House has raised money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's criticism of the Social Democrats' proposals was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, thus complying with the government's wishes that even the amended budget is less of a bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would still assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to seriously threaten to leave office in the event of amendments, the situation could have looked different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment for the prime minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering remaining in office.
This is due to his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks out in favour of another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas, the nominees of the ČSSD, which pushed for the changes in the budget, have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the Chamber approves other laws increasing the deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment to the Service Act.
Topolánek: ODS nominees not guilty
It's a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers of the ODS nominees did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the US.
He reminded that in several ministries there are people in deputy functions reporting to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign himself to the principle of combating the level of the public deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he will lean on the left-wing majority that is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
But he said he could not count on the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I did not think about it, and when it is up to date, I will deal with it, Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated to the government by the civic democrats, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for a European Council meeting in the afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS backed down
At the same time, Nečas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in the House on Wednesday if the prime minister did not explicitly ask the Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS did not weigh on the absence of the party leader in parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
Even when I was giving up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about the Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new ČD order, fewer trains will run for almost the same fare
From 13 December, Czech Railways will cancel or limit some less busy speedsters and locales, while other connections will strengthen.
The overall scope of transport will be reduced by two percent from the date of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, residents of Ostrava will get more access to the capital, the tracks will add one pendolino train to this track.
The high-speed train, on the other hand, will stop going to Bratislava.
Fewer express trains will also go on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be limited.
From the regions, the railways plan the largest reduction of transport in the Hradec Králové Region, a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to the increase.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to some days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovice has to transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
Passengers will no longer be transported by pendoline to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year's account for regional rail: 200 million more
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total, to pay the so-called demonstrable loss, it will give the railways four billion crowns next year, as it did this year. Locals order the regions, pay a total of eight billion crowns for them next year, while less than three billion regions will be contributed by the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have a newly concluded ten-year contract for locals and speedsters, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The railways praise the system, and therefore apparently did not reach for an increase in the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will occur only in the one-day network tickets of ČD Net and cheap internet tickets eLiška.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will be newly based on the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform for the journey between arbitrary regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Philippine militants still detain more than 50 people, children released
The militants kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several elementary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 militants are said to be using the hostages as a living shield while fleeing police.
Local negotiators are now trying to arrange the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police initially pursued the kidnapper because of violence that required the settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province, martial law was declared because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the election to the governorship were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential House of Ampatuans, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (the official title in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, whom he said he chose Mandela himself for his portrayal years ago.
The men's role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francoise Pienaar was played by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the film to cinemas, they arise from the responses of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born 18. July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993, along with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was president of South Africa from 1994-1999.
high expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup in football are peaking in South Africa, but at the same time the media is shaken by the disturbing news of increasing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the Associated Press, the responses to the new film in South Africa are overwhelmingly positive for now, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the main roles by "well-known" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I've been dreaming about the role for years and preparing well for it.
I have also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to - as they say - to recharge his energy, he stated in an interview after the film's ceremonial premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can commemorate Mandela's personality and message with the film.
It's the story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the national rugby team jersey
Based on the book by British writer John Carlin, in the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave rise to the nation, it portrays a South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, therefore, tries to cement two racial and for many years mutually defined groups of the population, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also enters the field of the World Cup, which was won by South Africa in the acting role in the South African national rugby jersey.
For entering the lawn in a jersey that is almost as sacred in South Africa, Mandela received a large ovation of a predominantly white audience fourteen years ago and gained the recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reconnect people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical of how, in a recent interview with LN, rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, revealed.
The championship will begin with 11. June 2010.
A transformer burns in Louny for tens of millions of crowns
The fire was engulfed in the morning by Čeps transformer in a substation near the village of Výškov in the Louny region.
According to Lukáš Marvan, a spokesman for the regional firefighters in Ústí nad Labem, six units are involved in the fire.
Originally, firefighters wanted to burn out the transformer, but later reconsidered the opinion and the fire extinguished by a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical fault, the internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to the company's spokeswoman Pavla Mandátová, the crash does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be accurately quantified only after the fire is over.
According to Mandate, the ruined transformer will need to be replaced by a new one.
In the ten years of operation of Čeps, nothing similar has happened, defects of this type are unique, she added.
According to ČEZ spokeswoman Soni Holingerová Hendrychová, the supply of electricity was not interrupted, the functioning of households, authorities and companies was not affected by the fire of the transformer station.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as an exclusive transmission system operator, power lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers converting electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and the 4339-kilometer line route.
Jančura will file a criminal complaint for defamation against three CSSD governors
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura will file a criminal complaint today for defamation against three social-democratic governors.
And this to Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura stated this in the Twenty Minutes of Radiožurnál.
The lawsuit is related to the effort of the company to operate regional train transport in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three governors attack us and talk about choosing raisins, while we brought an offer only for what they wanted.
He claims that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for defamation to the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all counties that they had not taken their actions in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing a stimulus for the European Commission.
Hašek considers the filing of a criminal complaint to be a continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement by his company and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my own and my region, and I will invite other governors to do the same.
I assume that, even on this occasion, it will become clear that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and untrue arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising, which will draw attention to the disadvantageous move of the regions.
He told the radiojournal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign began with Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with Czech Railways and did not announce tenders for a contract of around 150 billion crowns.
According to Jančura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančur was also threatened by a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and optional
The vaccination against pneumococci will break down the habits since January.
It is supposed to be the first for families to be free and optional at the same time.
There are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance companies pay.
Experts are also clear about the vaccination process.
New vaccinations
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on August 2 and later could be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Those who started vaccinating last year or earlier have to pay for other booster vaccinations themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
Parents paid 1600 crowns for one dose or more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccine doses.
But it saves on the treatment that children without vaccinations would need.
So far, the state has given about 500 thousand a year for all vaccinations of children.
The paid vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain membranes and blood poisoning.
According to hospital investigations, up to 28 children under the age of 10 will die from pneumococcal infections in a year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced a covered vaccination of children against pneumococci in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
It is due to be paid by insurance companies and optional from January.
For example, the head of the civic association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovský, indicated that vaccination would be better.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccines.
Experts at the international conference, which our association participated in, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we managed to achieve at least this.
I think that's the path we have to take now, Kalovský said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococci.
We are not considering it at all at this time, said its spokesman, Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
The President of the Professional Society of General Pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochová, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of booster vaccinations "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand fairly the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," Cabrnoch says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of fresh parents to get their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first blanket vaccination of children paid for by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, save on further treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy fabrics themselves
But this is related to the concerns of general pediatricians about vaccine purchases.
According to the original intention, the vaccines were to be bought by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
But some MPs feared that insurance companies could "get money out of health insurance."
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual general practitioners will invest 40 thousand a month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, Cabrnoch says.
American artist's son 'stole in museum'
The son of renowned American fantasy maker Frank Frazetta has been charged with attempted robbery of paintings worth 20 million dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
The name Mr. Frazetta and the other man used an excavator for the break-in into the museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, 81 years old, is famous for creating characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
By the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official who said Mr. Frazetta Jr. could be motivated to act by long-running family disputes.
In front of police, Mr. Frazetta Jr. issued an affidavit, age 52, that he did so at his father's instruction "to reach the museum in any way possible and move the paintings to the malting premises," according to the agency.
Mr Frazetta senior has denied granting any such permission, as the agency said.
Labour defends itself with planned tax rises
The ministers advocated an increase in taxes and a reduction in spending, announced in a preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Tories have "squandered" the possibility of showing that they are serious about delaying the deficit reduction decision until after the election.
The chancellor, too, came under fire because of the disabilities of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Angry about Social Security
The unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not cause and warned in advance of "problems."
Social insurance is increasing - the increase is around 3 trillion pounds a year - which has outraged a community of entrepreneurs who have said it is a tax on employment while there should be a focus on rebuilding the economy.
This increase, limited to these revenues of more than 20000 pounds a year, will affect around 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS PBR
Social Security will increase by a further 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected, by 4.75 per cent this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers' bonuses
Increase in 1% tax on companies for depreciation for small firms
Tax cut for electric cars and wind farms
Increase pensions by 2.5%
According to the state's financial administration estimate, some revenues of 30000 pounds will be reduced by 90 pounds a year, and some revenues of 40000 pounds will be reduced by 190 pounds, while some revenues of 10000 pounds will increase by 110 pounds.
Ministers announced that their deficit reduction target by 2013 meant "complicated decision-making" but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall to 5% of those with the highest incomes.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending cuts were a "drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers. This will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years.”
Mr Timms said he was confident the economy was expected to grow at the turn of the year.
But the development of a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In his opinion, he said, the economy's decline this year was 4.75 per cent - far worse than a decline of 3.5%, forecast in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
A missed opportunity'
The Conservatives, who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday warning of Labour's "indebtedness crisis," called the planned loan of 789 trillion pounds over the next six years intolerable.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan for how this could be paid, added, "cynically" postponed this decision until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
"They have not added anything significant that is feasible," shadow finance minister Philip Hammond said in a statement. "They had a chance to do it, but they wasted it."
" All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory's proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are "built on the sand."
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said about the timing of the communication - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay benefits in the next April - that this could lead to the chancellor's accusations in the election campaign if the money was difficult to recover a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised to September 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Although ministers did not disclose details of the expenditure after 2011, economists said it was clear that reducing public spending would be only the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The respected Institute of Budget Studies said the chancellor's figures suggest substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in the future include transportation, higher education and defense.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All the important statements will come after the election if we win them," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to the Deloitte account reviral.
"That was a report of a suspicious preliminary budget. The markets are implementing it.”
FBI conducts investigations into 'U.S. prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting investigations into the prison in Pakistan of five Americans suspected of links to extremists.
The men were jailed for attacking a house in Sargoda in eastern Punjab province, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was an investigation into whether these were the same men who were declared missing in their last month in their home in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are from Pakistan, one of which has Egyptian ancestors and the others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and under what circumstances they were staying there," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the incarceration and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are actually missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
It said the house had always been the focus of interest of the local police and that charges had not yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the news agency said, but said the United States must "work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism, which it continues to recruit and train people."
The disappearance of these five students from a home in northern Virginia was reported by their families at the end of November.
Rejecting the amnesty for the Iranian abusers.
The situation in respect for human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, according to a report by the Amnesty International Group.
The report details "ways of torture" in the regime before and after the disputed presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was in danger of being raped.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were jailed and dozens killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which led to the biggest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them were detained and prosecutors sentenced the last five people to death.
The BBC's Tehran letterer, John Leyne, now located in London, said earlier in protests by Supreme Leader Ayyatolah Ali Khomeini declared the unjustification of some modes of torture and banned their implementation at the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticisms of legal power have been tolerated, as our correspondent put it.
Untrue confession'
Amnesty International quoted a report by 26-year-old computer science student Ibrahim Methari, who said he was charged with "working with the Facebook network" and for protesting the election results.
"They often beat me in the face," he said in the statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... They threatened me with execution and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the protests after the election and was tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior civil servants have denied allegations of rape but have admitted torture took place.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former prisoner who said he was kept in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at a Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election riots and the government's responses, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees were published.
The group said at least 90 people have been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a downhill track for the race.
The downhill run for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the ski runway in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping bridge in front of the 100 m long downhill run.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the downhill run, but that it was truly daunting.
It was a wonderful sight of the blinking lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
The awards were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the downhill run.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and generally spreading alarming reports of the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and reported, reflecting on whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they integrate - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French don't like headscarves" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on contentious issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years and whose impacts are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a wider and much more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the foundation.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now care for 5 ÷ 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that worry them the most.
Should a Muslim enter into a marriage in a mosque or in a town hall (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-based banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These are the seemingly secular contentious issues that are being discussed, and which are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known persons, including Tarik Ramadan, an Arab, a Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society at the same time.
They don't have arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen conducted an interview are inclined to believe that it is the opposite of Selafi—the supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but it affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
It wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so doggedly defend the general public) are truly committed to the idea of pluralism.
He is of the opinion that Muslims probably have less experience on issues of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "tightening the screws of values."
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The most bleak prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the other environment of the planet.
The boundary ice melts at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water resources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In the book "On Thin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, recounts the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well-familiar with the complicated history and practices of whaling describes the long tradition of polar explorers trying to seize a white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a brave fourteen-year-old lifeguard who struggled only with the round of the musket is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears who swam behind the bodies of their just-slain mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early 20th century, 75 polar bears were performing at once in a circus tent.
Even today, the fences at the zoo typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adult individuals in the wild. The climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on works by other writers and historians and often goes back to the threat of hunters endangering the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where they are hunted from helicopters and Indians on skis, and all are armed with powerful assault rifles to blast their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "On Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and dismal responsibility of science for the Arctic and an engaging glimpse of how the future can change it.
Scientists have no answers to everything.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate answer to the speed of change.
This for lack of exams.
The research paths of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated how floating ice was moving.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the shifting divides when they sailed them.
Satellite exploration and extensive fields of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still held thanks to fearless individuals camping in winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the catchment system 'inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water, which shrinks when freezing.
But from the bear's high to the microscopic miracles, all of this is doomed once the summer ice moves, which will happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months...it can be us'
6000 Marines laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the soldier's grave, which he had never encountered.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the graves, this was a day in which they paid tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In the few months we'll board, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me so that they can show me respect in the way I try to do.
He was one of more than 6000 volunteers gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at a veterans' cemetery in several departments during a commemorative ceremony in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during a commemorative act in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make this journey every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memory of members of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcestesters are not looking for profit in this, wreaths across America, which they are also laying in other states.
That year, volunteers laid more than 16000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York City, and at the memorial site of Flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year running, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than 150000 dollars to buy and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Ms. Hunt said it was her way of returning what the victim was doing.
It's a small way citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like a visit to the family grave.
Drened in warm cloth cloaks, volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed for older graves from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as more recent graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held their hands together as they transported the young pine tree to the grayed-up tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arc hairpiece of the upper part.
There was a real silence in Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The combined service organizations donated 1000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the currently ongoing wars filled this area.
Some were crying sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends kept each other in the cold air.
Some read names aloud, engraved in stones, while others bent to view small black-and-white name tags, pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones were not yet placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of nautical artillery sgt. David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . .my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. government contractor jailed by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has jailed a U.S. government contractor who imported cellphones and laptops into the country, as State Department officials said Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, has worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. interest section in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was jailed on December 5.
Certain charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner can be jailed for almost anything that is labeled "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical stats, raise the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
In Cuba, there is a young blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Ms Sánchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country so she could take the prizes, but was denied permission.
The detention of the U.S. contractor may be the result of rising tensions between Castro's communist brother, ruling Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been tracked as a "delaying tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report on the New York Times' imprisonment Friday night.
The new U.S. policy has highlighted that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more space for the opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, though they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average wage of a public servant is 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used for text messaging, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one daily wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to apply must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in the prison in Cuba are behind bars for offences such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, press official of the U.S.-interest section in Havana.
Ms Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which in any other open society would be legal - let's say free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. human rights program, which recently published an unfavorable report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, the same Cuba," as an allusion to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader and a replacement for his ill-abiding older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and jailed in one day.
He stated that all solutions would be rather political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States just as these two countries are moving towards more extensive dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are uncovering a conspiracy involving the sending of men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered an alleged conspiracy leader involving the deployment of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of U.S. troops there, saying they hoped the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters snooping around the internet and searching for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were searching for a grey rebel figure, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of those men posted a commentary approving the terrorist attacks on YouTube's Internet video page.
Saifillah took charge of these men when they came to Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan in the Pakistani indigenous tribes, which is home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who filed a report on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaida commanders and that the men were not part of a CIA attempt to infiltrate the terror network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern district of Sarghody, far from the threatening mountains in the northwest, which became a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike unit.
Why they were planted, said the official, who spoke of maintaining anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to get approval to gain access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the exercise of Pakistani law.
The case of this five - who remained in Pakistan and was interrogated by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is credible.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, decommissioning those who are not sufficiently serious in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spys.
U.S. fake recruits have been subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaida, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because given their potential approach to American targets and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an senior analyst at the U.S.-based NEFA, said terrorist groups have also become considerably more cautious in recent years in allowing him to step in because U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts on their recruitment methods.
If we try to break into these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been monitored so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched the streets this Saturday demanding more forceful action on climate from negotiators at the Bella city convention center.
Protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police adhowe that the number was closer to 25000.
The event was relatively quiet, and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day of the small incident in climate talks sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city carrying banners reading "This is not planet B" and one in Spanish, which proclaimed "Earth says 'enough'."
Several celebrities participated in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the bleak state of the country, in which the influence of climate change is still taking place.
That's a partial reason why we decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leading figures to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry it out, it can not be avoided all the time.
Police prevented the protesters from approaching the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating spectators, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate talk, activists disguised as athletes and in black suits have laid several charges near the Copenhagen main channel, located near several ministries.
They agitated near the buildings, he stated, starting with flares, but then followed by "several large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration nevertheless had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of".
Then he continued to Chinese and said, "Because the venue is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
The focus of the general public and different sectors and the subject of climate change is seen, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that this is a violation of the conduct or freedom of other persons.
The test's data revealed constant persistent racial differences
The federal certificate last week on the knowledge of mathematics was a welcome element of the good news about the Columbia public education district.
Although the district is far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater advances in fourth- and eighth grade pupils over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Attestation Center for Advancement in Teaching are the persistent differences in the knowledge achieved between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average result of the white pupils of the fourth grades of the District of Columbia in the last two years increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but their African-American peers grew by only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the difference in knowledge achieved increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
The advance for African-Americans in eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a diversion of a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result for white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture within six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils of the fourth grades in 2003, when the first NAEP was carried out in the precinct, was 60 points of the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result improved in both groups during this period, the difference was barely close to 58.
Some advocates for education in the precinct have said in the last week that the results, celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) was more extensively stimulated in white students where there were already high results.
That would suggest that we have increased the total support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, D.C.'s chief executive. Voice, a non-gainless group that advocates equality of education in the precinct.
I'm not jumping up and down because of a dispersal of two or three points, a D.C. committee member said. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Often criticizing Ms. Rhee's style of governance, Ms Brown said the report of test results means secondary education in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the positives and I respect that.
But what is terrible is that we devoted almost no time and energy to our secondary education.
Ms. Rhee said the district's effort is to continue to find better ways, focused on the needs of low-out students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum of readings, Wilson’s reading system, aimed at upper-class elementary school students and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their cologue careers and are significantly behind their peers.
The daily mathematics and curriculum of teaching mathematics to the sixth grade, highlighting the games and experiences of real life that reached the precinct under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think we should keep working and carry out the best possible interventions in those students who remain below class level, Ms. Rhee said.
Others said the NAEP results had clarified the question of whether Ms Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It's a certain distinct dilemma of Ms. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus the resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the Columbia Precinct.
Thus, the focus can bring political reverberations that go against an important agenda.
But the criticism also belongs to other city directors, who are trying to maintain a middle proportion between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must strengthen the affinity of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can rely on their children to be given excellent public instruction.
Mr. Janey, now head of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the precinct, to make the legitimacy of schools take place.
You have to get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his teacher association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers a "symptom" for looking for a bigger increase next year.
Making higher education a part of a better future
The tour bus drove into the Gettysburg track with a loud breath.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and rested momentarily on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracielina's parents have hardly graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the attic of the college.
Now she and other eighth-grade students in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where the tuition was 38690 dollars a year, their position was rather than fearful visitors enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! Yes! That's it! exclaimed Graciel, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully, when they were told by the low proportion of professors to the students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of seven they visited on their three-day tour and have now been completely intrigued by the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the dorm.
The question is where.
However, this is a carrier problem concerning the high number of U.S.-born children of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from colleges or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive a college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "second generation" of Spanish pupils from the dorm - the remarkable achievements indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and residents of Central America, made their way to the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underlines their point of the way forward for a generation that has played a marginal role in the field of the country's workforce.
Those who have achieved a university degree say they have had a natural affection for the school and an innate penetration and effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to replace ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and the millions of children who would like to do dorms - especially if those efforts persist over time.
Taking into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at each individual point will not solve this, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American field.
We need to think about providing these children with a detention net in preschool in every way that they are going to go to college.
The federal program that funded Graciely's trip on the tracks is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (to prepare), it provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to run dormitory preparatory programs that act for students from low-income groups in high schools and continue until those students graduate college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than a percent of whom have entered dorms, according to U.S. Department of Education data.
Iraq's Oil Ministry reaches deal with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their sick infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by Iraq's oil ministry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in the recovery of Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of wars and sanctions.
U.S. companies have gone with capital participation in just two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies paid for participation in the second auction, which began Friday.
Only one submitted a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies have reached field agreements that were auctioned in June.
The sharmer participation of U.S. oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have the way of Asians and Europeans in the first place, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
That will be for long before something else goes on sale in Iraq.
Concerns about security, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military are likely to deter U.S. companies from a much more intense business in Iraq that has demonstrably the third-largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
U.S. firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have noticeably lower operating costs and are more prone to risk-taking because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies that made deals with the ministry.
Leading U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained close contacts with the Iraqi oil industry and offered technical assistance in years past, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were assigned at the end of this week.
China's state-run National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers for more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is seeking to become the main economic force, as does the technological force, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Oil Ministry.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and will live up to its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that have been pre-selected for submitting offers, which have then been compared by the ministry according to the price per barrel and the ministry is willing to pay to strengthen the output above the current levels in each field.
The top al-Qaida planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
A senior al-Qaida planner apparently killed on the impact of a U.S. missile near the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, according to officials at the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Department.
As confirmed, it could be the second fatal attack on one of the terrorist's top leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were killed when several rockets landed in a quarter on their car near the town of Miran Śah in the province of North Vaziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have ruled that the missiles were launched from a non-crew aircraft with which the CIA operates in a zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were led to a white car that was heading toward the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said, along with Pakistan's cicilian intelligence agency, which phoned from Miran Shah.
The official said local gunmen rushed to the point and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. officials at the counter-terrorism department cited an unspecified witness who said Somali was dead.
Somali was listed as a high-ranking planner of al-Qaida's military operations, which managed the operations of groups of terrorists outside the region of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in a creampage around the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be named, who indicated the sensitive nature of U.S. air strikes on Pakistan's territory.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the top leadership of Al Qaeda and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said Somali was rapidly advancing in the al-Qaida hierarchy and was well linked to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban, who should be killed since September when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the indigenous tribes band and three other top-class post-operative leaders, was killed in a similar attack.
The pace of the attacks launched by the CIA using drones has been reduced since the summer from an average of around six operations per month to two, according to Long War records, a website managed by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may have a reason in improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to curb their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people who they suspected to be informants, the site said.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Kabul has resigned.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would like to step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that was thwarted by allegations of widespread corruption in the election of a president in Afghanistan, backed by the United Nations.
Eide's departure is taking place because the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegate said it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for reducing the state, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they are supposed to have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The rise on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but that he was simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Ban Ki-moon, secretary general, has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look for the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to U.N. officials, Ban has begun seeking a replacement.
Officials said it was decided between Staffan di Mistura, who has Swedish-Italian origins and previously led the U.N. mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, the Frenchman who had previously led the U.N. peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was charged in September with President Hamidem Karzai, who won the provincial presidential election by masking the presence of massive election machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but said the accusations of Galgraith -- who was released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism here with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide said he was proposing a meeting with the citizens' top deputy to coordinate the relief of efforts at the leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the leadership of the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them for the Afghan mission, because, he says, he would want to strengthen their confidence that their money is being spent properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at limiting his efforts in Afghanistan, saying the U.N.'s cumbersome hiring regulations undermine her ability to use her abilities.
The U.N. rules are such that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, he said.
This is a disaster and I cannot continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "other significant sanctions" on Iran because of a lack of involvement in talks on his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to areas where wars are underway in Afghanistan and Iraq, has downplayed the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's query for likely development. ̈
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is inherently unpredictability in war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of those sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said a "pack of incentives and inhibitions" would require "to get the Iranian government to actually feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its residents will suffer extraordinarily" from sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it does not put its nuclear program in full compliance with the U.N. Nuclear Security Committee and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva 1 interviews. He indicated in October that he wanted to return to talks on curbing his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his uranium-enriched stockpiles in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way of establishing trust between the two parties and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran has been withdrawing from the interim agreements - partly because, according to the expert, because the Iram leadership is divided in views on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, when it comes to Iran's stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals he actually agreed to in early October, I think it has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together, on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions on the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on December 31 to respond to proposals before returning to seeking other choices including surveillance, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned on Thursday what it called "unfounded and unfounded accusations" before some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities, saying it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to an area of Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
There is a persistent high tension between Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly because of borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce conflict potentials to prevent delays in U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to dampen Kurdish concern about the persistent depression. The U.S. official sites quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, “We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on which they read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave."
Then they learned a lesson that when official government sites in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the ageing population in their city, they suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We left nothing for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China's more than 30-year-long policy of having only one child has been introduced, creating two generations of only notoriously chubby and spoiled children, affected by the nicknamed "little emperors," the country is threatened by a population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six, compared to six, before the policy came into effect, according to UN figures.
The distribution of the population, where the population is 60 years old and above, is predicted to grow tumultuously from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. That's far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater wealthy coastal cities with a population with a higher education, for example, in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and up accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission on Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of an ageing population and reduce the number of workforces in the future."
He says it's about "being old, that doesn't mean being rich -- like in evolved countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual calming
As put into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate established under Communist Party rule to this day.
The pair, who violated politics, faced immense fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official sites have championed policies that have helped prevent the country from drawing on natural resources critically, while human rights advocates have been condemned in pursuing policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortions in a second child.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo sexist-selective abortions leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In past years, population officials have gradually been milder in their opinion on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed exemptions - including residents of cities, members of national minorities, and cases where man and woman were singles -- and in 2007 tempered the diction of their slogans, pushing for a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing's Institute of Population Research, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became China's first city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters, urging parents to have just one child, were replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and insert leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who chose to have more than one child.
The response was cold, officials for family planning said.
Grieving response
Although officials in one rural town around Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in pairs who would like to have a second child after the campaign begins, most of the city's precincts have not reported changes.
The Huinan municipal district with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caol district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people don't want to have more children.
They want to provide the best for the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and have been legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese people who have only inadequate health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a docial safety net, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the west judge the one-child policy wrongly as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is in a bond with her first child at seven months pregnant.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
It's about the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: "We were the center of our families' attention and everyone was taking care of us.
We were not used to provide care and in fact we didn't want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns the translation company, expressed it much more openly.
For middle-class two-career parents who have reduced the birth rate, he said, to be successful is to be selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-olds view parents as breaking through the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of living for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on the time of parents, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still contentious questions of the prostor -- "You need to rebuild your apartment" -- and strategy -- "You have to have a resume ready at a time when the child is 9 months for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher life standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The U.N. Group outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching unruly attitudes and mutual misrepresentation -- again on Friday, it focused on releasing a document that proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas levels over the next 40 years with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which can provide a starting point for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But it has seen important progress in negotiations that have taken place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text inconspicuously states how much money rich countries should provide to those poor for dealing with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a full range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of the rise in global temperature that political officials will still be able to tolerate.
That will add a great deal of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, the top official of the Washington-based Sierra club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, a briefing from 180 pages of text from the meeting to focus on what a top official on UN climate issues, Yvo de Boer, described as "a big picture."
It outlines the outlines for a possible agreement in which industrialized nations could jointly limit their emissions to between 25 and 45 percent by year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions during that period to 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union urgently discussed on Friday a promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adopt adaptation to climate change -- from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
But he still Friday reported the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in interviews last week.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Affairs Todd Stern dismissed a speech calling for binding greenhouse gas emissions restrictions for industrialized countries compared to voluntary among major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had established a tougher line against China than Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not accept the treaty without transferring major developing countries and carrying out actions, Stern said, also complaining that the text was not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be screened by outside observers.
Stern made that comment an hour after China's Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei told the U.S. chief negotiator on climate issues that either a lack of "common sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" had led earlier in the week to a message that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the world's major powers at stake, the tug-of-war has erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States to meet their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that the two dozen most influential countries in the world ignore the scientific imperatives for carrying out more forceful actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rica delegate, said it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers from responsibly in their actions.
It's clearly a game about the new economic hegemony unfolding, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to push for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Small Island State Alliance, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft deal last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said enforcement by small island nations "has triggered political pressure on the entire political process" in part because they are now unified and demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations have sparked a new urgency once the delegates have focused on the fact that they have to resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of government meet for a deal.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China's deputy minister, have stepped out of the planes and run through the halls of the Bella Center to close the doors of meetings and new conferences so they could set out claims that will be assessed next week.
The sheer vastness of the gathering - when 13000 people moved daily from and to the convention center, on guitars playing activists staged at night the ironic spectacles about the countries they thought sent them, and there was a hand-in-hand hand-to-hand hand-to-hand designs on paper rather than by e-mail -- controlled by a challenge.
The intensity is only superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen, and 60 heads of state were present earlier on Wednesday.
We have made it into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the deputy secretary for global policy at international nature conservation said.
Heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first train, with a speed of 140 miles per hour, redefined this Monday's feelings
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness in a sign of the train's departure, which marked a revolution in Britain's transport.
The country's first high-speed passenger train reaches 140 miles per hour and passes from Ashford, Kent, to London's St Pancras, and crosses a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport secretary, then joined Ms. Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger kit outside of Lndon.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and will connect large agglomerations of Midland, the north and Scotland with London.
Neglected standing waters should be reduced in passenger and commercial travel, and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road traffic jams.
In theory, the three main political parties have been given for this vision.
But dozens of bilina pounds, needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight over projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now hampered the construction of Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company, created in January to provide a feasible study to the government, forwarded its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times reported.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route of London's connection to western Midland has been designed within five metres in urban areas and neighbourhoods where the impact on the environment could be problematic.
In the open countryside, a final route was planned within 25 m.
HS2 also anticipates setting three options for a vast high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred choice is a Y-shaped configuration where one high-speed line should lead to western Midland.
The track should divide near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like there was the most powerful choice," he said, and a railway expert.
Once done, the journey times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals should allow trains to run at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already designed to carry 400 m long trains capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 rigs could operate every hour on the London-Birming track.
It means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20000 passengers per hour if necessary.
Given the capital constraints, it is envisaged that existing stations would expand to accommodate a high-speed network.
Experts from the rail industry say only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but large-scale public consultations and planning procedures mean that what the final decision does not take place before the general election.
Even if the wheels move, the net should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into operation not on high-speed lines but already existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered a crucial point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay off 75000 pound mortgage on Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory's front-runner-up chair in the House of Commons, was paid thousands of pounds of the cost last year for the Orangery he had built at his home in the constituency.
A party spokesman for the prison, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "out of rations," increased his mortgage to 75000 pounds to build an oak-lined extension at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in a timely manner and so it was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg, who carried out the control of the member's expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan made his demands "it shouldn't have been cleaner or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of Parliament's richest members, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth around a million pounds.
On the ground floor is a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the tax office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is planned to be labeled "orangery."
The neighbors describe it as "a greenhouse for fun and treats."
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privilegia in the latest mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules, after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pupillary security to a mortgage of 271406 pounds from his property in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed Mr Duncan claimed around 1400 pounds a month in the interest of a mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1800 pounds per month.
Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage repayment interest could not have changed at this time, suggesting that all of this was intended to finance a loan of 75000 pounds.
The standard variable of RBS mortgage repayments fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, while remaining.
The last document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim 1250 pounds a month this May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as the shadow head of the House in September after one secret editorial filmed him and said MPs must survive "on allocation" after the spending scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live on the ration and treat you like a s**t."
He said: "I spent money on my garden and claim and a small fraction on what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it.'
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his editions in May when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the tax authority's approval, that it "can be considered excessive."
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr Duncan's turf in protest after revealing that he claimed 4000 pounds for three years.
When asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the tax office and subsequently Legg."
He added: "this is not a contentious issue of hiding and zigzagging or breaking rules or anything else.
It's an absolutely straight line down, by the rules, justified and that's it.
This could not be cleaner or simpler in many other ways.”
Come and see the cottage on the Brighton coast with the advent calendar.
The coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new meaning in life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages clericity by creativity has called on 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas carols as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when it allowed visitors to view the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and bishop's bread and mulled wine, provided free of charge.
The selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cottage featured the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, assistant at television marketing from Hove, is a priest without a scholarship in the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion much more important to people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we, as a church, expect people to come to a foreign old building? I feel that the Church should come to people and serve in a waking way.
"The idea of the advent calendar in the cottages was created just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday with a demand for a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources and a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, manifested in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday that could come into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said the growing global mobilization, the clear evidence of which is the current demonstration, has contributed to the fact that the "political tax" on a possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the opening of the procession, when a group of about 300 protesters, dressed in black, began smashing shop windows with cobblestones and hammers.
The riot police immediately intervened emphatically.
In total, police announced the arrests of between 600 and 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultraradical separate groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "indiscriminately" and stressed that about a hundred were in handcuffs and sitting "held in the streets still on Saturday night "even despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly made its way towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
For the speakers was built a stage, before which a spiritual meeting was held by candlelight with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate."
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a settlement of the environmental debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't say to ourselves anymore: it's time for that, Benin singer Angelique Kidjo claimed.
In Africa, rivers and watercourses dry up, we can walk in them today, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement to fight for another world approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice." “There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world.”
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which many islands particularly sensitive to warming climates are located.
In Australia, some 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
Several hundred people marched in Manila, mostly students, in red clothes and with scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters took to the streets demanding a strong measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the "350" movement, primarily in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, while Tbilisi declared the move a "farce."
About 131000 people were invited to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 on control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 17pm GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazian Election Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the polls closed.
The first preliminary results are expected to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsha, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which condemned the election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian rule," its spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of the territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict in which several thousand people were killed, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, Kvarčija Svetlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapš, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to vote at a polling station at a school in the capital, Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian rule is the main theme of presidential elections in this region on the shores of the Black Sea, which boasts beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216,000 residents, huge billboards are deployed with Bagapsh alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials, who had come to oversee the successful conduct of the elections, received a warm welcome from the district mayor of Beslan Arshba.
"We, the Abkhazians, are grateful "said in a small ceremony, referring to the support of Moscow and especially its decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, and toasted a glass of vodka on it.
The opposition, which was represented in the election by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia control of Abkhazia's rail network for a period of 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
An absolute 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive fight must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday with a demand for a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources and a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, manifested in the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, negotiating an agreement that could come into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly made its way towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
For the speakers was built a stage, before which a spiritual meeting was held by candlelight with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed whole in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing shop windows.
The riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several demonstrators to the ground.
In total, police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer on his jaw was wounded with a cobblestone and four cars were set on fire near a squat located near incidents that resulted in the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are concentrating on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while police helicopters have again flown into the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, formed their first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate."
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a settlement of the environmental debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice." “There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world.”
Oxfam has called in several well-known figures, including Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which many islands particularly sensitive to warming climates are located.
In Australia, some 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and with scarves evoking the importance of solar energy, manifested in front of the Philippine capital city.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred protesters also met with the demand for a strong measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the "350" movement, primarily in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general grammar school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said on Sunday during an interview with JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" in the framework of the reform of the general grammar school, even though their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the final year of the grammar school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week, and for everyone, the same program will be from general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end hypocrisy" because, according to him, the specialization S is no longer focused on exact sciences" but "basically the best students are in it."
The specialization of ES and L cannot be for S by a kind of sub-specializations, he continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would complain that geography and history are not taught in the last year of professional grammar schools".
The Ifop poll, published on Saturday by the daily Humanité, showed that seven Frenchmen out of ten (69%) disagree with the government's project to abolish compulsory teaching of history and geography in the senior year with specialization S, also why many intellectuals and teachers have criticised the cancellation, both the left and some MPs of the right.
The minister, on the other hand, added that "it is not an option" to abolish philosophy in the program of specialization With the graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform of teaching education, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they say sacrifices to the pedagogical education of future grammar school professors.
As part of Master's degree 2 (M2), he will undergo an entrance exam focused on their field and at the end of the year another exam verifying their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will participate in professional internships during the second year of master's studies and will perform in front of pupils as a professor-intern.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admissions process, you will gain more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, he continued .
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education," which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen summit: this is a challenge announced in the morning by Jean Jouzel, multi-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) at the initiative of the University of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a kind of one-day seminar composed of fifteen-minute contributions from experts that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and on what basis they would have a greater desire to learn something more, explained 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after a fish from a local pond, which was named by students.
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected and specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
About the warming climate "we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke in front of fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, only with the help of graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he emphasized with the hope that listeners will recognize that "the Copenhagen conference relies on very seriously prepared scientific foundations."
Videos shot at these lectures will be placed on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February and more will follow with regularity every two months.
Payment delays: angry prison guards, planned measures
The prison guards' unions announced a "general mobilization" on Friday as they demand that their premiums and overtime be reimbursed for the Christmas holidays, the reimbursement of which was postponed to January for financial reasons.
The prison FO (2nd Union of Supervisors) asked employees who would not be on duty to take part in a demonstration held on Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities, and to "block" them, alerting them to "theft of their wages."
The CGT for prison guards (3rd union of the sector) called on them to "convene a gathering in individual prisons and start a major mobilization", saying it is "disgraceful and unacceptable" that "overtime and surcharges for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" worked in October are not paid in December.
The first unions of the guards, the Federal Union of Prison Wardens (Ufap/Unsa), "call for overall mobilization (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and outrage."
The Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime increased a lot in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellorship said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the unions of prison guards assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts that prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the Minister writes in her communication.
I have ordered the administrative directorate of prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which has arisen by a poor evaluation of the number of overtime, is never repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
The December wage will therefore be low, with the exception of executives who receive famous premiums for performing the function and meeting the targets, Ufap/Unsa says, and for those "there is always a place in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the interregional union of the FO in Marseille and announced its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and summonses."
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays, if they are not reimbursed for these days of October in December, as well as for overtime, there is also the risk of FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when more and more work is being given to us without being given additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking employees to pay for this, according to the CGT-prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, there are few funds, said the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives "better gifts" at Christmas than the ones he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, has confided to "goddess" screenworks Oprah Winfrey that in terms of gifts, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I receive."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the show, which will air on Sunday night on ABC about how they are going to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, a small four-legged companion of the family, gets his gift.
Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will also "of course" receive a gift, as is clear from the excerpts from the show's preliminary broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband's claim on the quality of the gifts she receives: "Of course not, I gave you some great gifts last year," she teased the president.
Well, of course, that's right, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards, with humor, he pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
On this one-hour very relaxed show with the famous presenter, who has been working hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obamas also talked about their most popular gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a round with a ten-speed gearbox, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father gave him at Christmas, which he encountered very rarely.
I remember when I saw my father, who came to see us at Christmas and how he gave me the basketball, the president told me.
It was only long after that that I realized that he had given me the ball.
The first lady remembered the dollhouse.
I didn't know how to organize it all in the house and so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama remembered.
Johnny Hallyday reoperative, RTL reports he's in an artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles because of "injuries" resulting from a major operation he underwent in France, but the situation is "under control" by his loved ones, while RTL said the singer was in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reoperativede on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors noted "injuries resulting from the operation" of the prolapsed disc, which he underwent in Paris on November 26, his press department said in Paris, saying the lesions required "repair surgery."
However, the singer's press department tried to reassure the public and said the situation was "under control" while also announcing that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, which is the lead partner of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday has been put into an artificial sleep to prevent "pain and complications."
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will be a little more confident, adds RTL.
The press department, when asked by AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
The RTL also reports that according to "some sources" no drains were stationed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic over a prolapsed disc.
The operation, which was scheduled just days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a physician well known in art circles.
The doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
After that surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles because of an infection that occurred after the hit.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad time" but added that he wasn't "worried" about the rocker because he was a big "fighter."
He called me just before flying to Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid things because spending 12 hours on a plane after such surgery is no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, reassured the situation, saying Johnny Hallyday was "responding well to antibiotics" and that the infection had been "halted."
Mr Camus also said he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any special concerns.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small tumor of the small intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour of "Tower 66," which is presented as his bachelorette.
But since then, every single one of his health issues has been very closely monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to again deny the news of the new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favourite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time world championship medalist at the 2009 World Championships in a large pool, won the title at the 2009 European Championships in a small swimming pool in Istanbul in a discipline he particularly likes: the 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, on which overalls are last allowed, only three world records fell, although many more were expected.
One of them was surpassed by Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztova at the 200 m position race and the two remaining men's relay of Russia on the 4x50 m position race.
A great sadness for Bousquet, who was attending himself to a world record of 50 m in a free way, of which he is already a holder in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal disciplines of swimming, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which ten swimmers first kicked off instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganjo (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he anticipated.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there is a world record in my reach, I will try to do it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore jumpsuits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The jumpsuits have helped to record 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host them in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the overalls this time did not help even the German Paul Biedermann, the two-time world champion in the big pool in the summer in Rome, who had the world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the record, which holds the 400-meter freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything into that race.
I knew I wasn't going to break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my task.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent for the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: A record of the Romanesque sarcophagus belonging to Zola was auctioned for US$1.5 million
The album of the Romanesque sarcophagus, which belonged to none other than French writer Emil Zol, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, significantly more than estimated, the art dealer Sotheby's said.
The price of this two-meter-long and 63 cm high front plate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
"The Marble "represents four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants is a rare piece, there are very few similar pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, Vice President of Ancient Roman and Egyptian Art auctions at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is the item that was probably bid on the most, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola bought this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The album was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated a bath with her in her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, the minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly the President of the Council before the rise to the power of Marshal Petain.
She remained shaded there for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz found in searching the museum's database in the Louvre that this board had been part of "Emil Zola's remains" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart."
An interrupted attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday concluded that the conditions for the transfer of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, were not met, to which the rebels refused to give a guarantee of a safe exit.
After the telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything indicates that there is no way to make this transfer possible, Mexican Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinos, said.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya, flew back again, a source told the Directorate-General for Migration.
The coup plotters' government wanted to force President Zelaya to "resign" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only in this way would it give him the option of a safe exit.
But the overthrown president rejected those demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the exiled head of state.
The coup government "has experienced another failure when it wanted me to give up my office (...), wanting me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he often speaks out about the political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, the deposed president added, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include an asylum application, the interior minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute told Hrn radio on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum for any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday supporters of the deposed president who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the military reinforced protection.
Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, has criticised the pup's position.
They show their marginal stance on international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who bonded with Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on 28. June, the day he organized in preparation for his re-election of public consultation, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of here, he will be arrested and held accountable for the crime of "high treason" from which he is accused, the coup government says.
On November 29, the coup president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election to replace President Zelaya.
In controversial elections, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance prompts optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended Thursday with a rise, and the results of the U.S. trade balance are indicative of a rise in both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to final deadline data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is concentrating on "half full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on U.S. trade balance numbers, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, by contrast, had expected a rise in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, a reflection of the growth of the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against everything expectations, and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
Treasury proceeds with a 10-year outlook increased to 3.482% versus 3.423% on Tuesday night, and yield to 30 years rose to 4.492% versus 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of regime proponents booed by "Ladies in White"
Several hundred proponents of the Cuban regime booed on Thursday by the wives of political prisoners, who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration at which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dams in White," wives or close political prisoners were booed right on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro regime during their march towards the center of the capital with a request to release political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Down with the Yankees!, "The mercenaries!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted with a raised fist by the regime's proponents of dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by members of the plainclothes who arrived to "ensure security."
The day before, there was a similar rally in Havana against "Ladies in White" but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, about ten dissidents were detained by members of the police, who were also preparing to manifest on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, AFP reported.
According to this journalist, the police loaded the dissidents, who were booed by the proponents of the government regime in civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions takes only a few hours from the rule.
The winners of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a sentence of 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom still remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their arch-enemy, the United States.
A finished miracle, Cuban television brought news of Thursday's demonstration of proponents of the government regime against "opponents of the revolution."
Cuba, with the Communist Party in the lead and the policies of the one-party government, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disrespecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman knifed an 80-year-old man and wounded 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and wounded five other people in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at a peak time on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, an attacker at the age of 28 allegedly assaulted two knives and, for unknown reasons, an 80-year-old man in a pharmacy or in front of him, on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of police and witnesses.
A severely injured old man, born in 1929, died of his injuries, according to the Alliance Police Syndicate in hospital.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, aged about thirty, began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital in which an eighty-year-old man died.
The life of the other injured person is in danger, according to police sources, vital authorities have apparently been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to hospital "in shock," a police source said.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as a police source reported, then fled to the street, still to boolevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more people, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old and forty-year-old man, the other seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, because everything happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried cross-behind his back, said at the scene of the head of the syndicate of the Alliance in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, have tried to stop and disarm the madman, according to testimony gathered by AFP.
I saw a thirty-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd hurled him, including a city police officer who had broken his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of number 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to detain an armed man while being injured with their fists, a police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a seventy-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place and noticed a large wound to his stomach, Frederic Allione, a thirty-five-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later came the second person, about thirty, who also had stab wounds with a knife.
A man who did not have his identity documents was later arrested by the state police.
The prosecutor in Nanterre referred the matter to the Investigative Department of the Regional Police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, awaiting questioning.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said six police officers were needed to manage him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "completely out of himself" as "all madmen of this type, whose strength increases tenfold in action."
U.S. lawyer again asks Polanski to end prosecution
Polish-French director Roman Polanski's lawyer again asked in Los Angeles (California, the West of the United States) on Thursday to halt the prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of a moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the director of "Pianist"'s attorney, criticized serious errors in the trial of three judges in the California Court's Court of Appeals, which occurred during a trial at the time of the 1977 events.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now and immediately, lawyer Hummel said, adding that from the conduct of the judge who was making the decision at the time, Laurence Rittenband "had a chill in his back."
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) allegedly negotiated with the prosecutor before the verdict was pronounced, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious offense against the rule of law.
The information about this interview appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and in demand), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared towards the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will demand the conduct of a trial in which he will be able to present evidence of his claim.
The prosecutor reiterated what was already said at the first state, namely that there would be no serious study of the application for a halt to the prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before the court handed down a verdict in the case of "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old underage girl.
Since then, he has never re-entered the United States.
A deputy prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
Do we want to say not only Romana Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Ms. Asayam.
He is of the opinion that the director "asks for a favor from the court and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to take a decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape."
The lawyer Hummel was not the only one who asked to stop the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, also again asked for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case emerged, adding: "No one in this room can say that the trial was fair."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on order of the US
After more than two months behind bars, he was put under house arrest at his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible deportation.
Wall Street ends without direction, hampered by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended Friday without a direction, the market is swirling among indicators that are better than expected in the U.S. and the rising price of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final deadline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance, left 0.55 points and finished at 2,290.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased greatly and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
The trend was also confirmed by publishing economic indicators that are better than expected and which "helped to improve the mood in the market in terms of stability of the economic recovery," the analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the U.S., retail sales rose 1.3% in November, for the second consecutive month and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate by the University of Michigan index, U.S. consumer confidence also returned, rising strongly to 73.4 in December against 67.4 the previous month.
But the indices have been hampered by a new rise in the dollar's price against the euro, which is the highest in two months, pushing downward sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Tech stocks are thus losing ground.
The securities market has fallen.
State treasure yield, with a 10-year view, rose to 3.540% versus 3.482% on Wednesday night and, with a 30-year view, increased to 4.497% versus 4.492% a day earlier.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa.
After a month of travel across South Africa, 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday are about to cross the finish line to achieve their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has been held for the second year around Johannesburg and for the time being five female candidates have won the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariata Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were voted Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth,Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so many experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, northern Johannesburg, from 17 o'clock (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream up a more beautiful country in which I put a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy I was able to experience it twice, Ksenia Sukhin, the Miss World, confided in the hot southern summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous encounters with other female candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "landscape that takes its breath away."
After a month of performances, rehearsals, meeting the press and safari, Miss is now concentrating on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participated in the election with Aishwarye Rai, the 1994 winner, who both became stars of Bollywood.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to return home with a crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will feature Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee Chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is hard to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
The candidates, like last year, participated in safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
For the president unusual, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely be back at the 2010 World Cup, says Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm of Miss Italy.
According to David's son, the news of Hallyday's condition is "very positive."
The news of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive," as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he flew in to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday, when he left the plane, which he flew from Paris shortly after 13 o'clock local time (21 o'clock world time)
The singer's son, who seemed calm, said he would "come to the Los Angeles hospital of Cedars-Sinaï" as quickly as possible, to which Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a postoperative infection resulting from the operation of a prolapsed intervertebral disc, which he underwent on November 26 in Paris.
According to a press release, the singer was "put into an artificial sleep" for comfort because of the night in Los Angeles, which is intended to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday has already been put into an artificial sleep by Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles. The hospitalization occurred due to an infection following the operation of a prolapsed intervertebral disc made on November 26 in Paris.
Due to serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the AFP photographer, his wife, Laeticia, attended a school performance of a French lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The preference of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology Hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he was leaving for the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has harshly accused Dr Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Surgeons from Los Angeles said they were outraged, M reported. Camus.
I've heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has gone too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
Personally, I spoke with the doctor by phone and he assured me that this trip is not a problem, which surprised me greatly, because I myself have already suffered twice from the prolapse of the intervertebral disc, he added.
A moment earlier on the RTL radio station, he said the singer had apparently left after a Parisian operation without a drain, without anything."
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in art circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which she was working on at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg in the removal of a hematoma resulting from a brain haemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of medical neglect, tax evasion and fraud.
Medical chamber lawyer Olivier Metzner described him as "a man without scruples" who is "regularly" summoned to the medical chamber, and whom he can't even "far recommend."
After a few days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux commented on the matter on Friday through his attorney, David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had "a completely good course" and the postoperative examination was "normal."
The operation was not of a hemorrhagic nature, therefore the introduction of the drain was not necessary,” he added.
The singer's health problems have been growing since this summer and, in any case, his next tour seems to remain with a question mark.
Clearly, the date of the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 appears too close, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre party not to continue to enjoy their shortcut.
The UDF association, controlled by MoDemFrançois Bayrou's party, on Friday responded to an attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervý Morin, to appropriate the acronym of the former Giscard Party, saying he was not allowed to use the shortcut in any medium under the threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to appropriate the acronym UDF, saying that François Bayrou does not deserve to carry her inheritance after handing down his hand to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
His move won support from Member of Hervý de Charett (former za-UMP now on behalf of NC), who credits UDF brand ownership because he first had it registered at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday night, a committee of the UDF Association run by friends of François Bayrou, who have no intention of being expropriated, stepped out of his silence and made a formal request to both the minister and MPs to stop using the shortcut and hand back ownership of the trademark, under the threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised disturbing statements that you will propose to your political movement +retake the acronym UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name+Nouveau center+ on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement, with the slogan +UDF of today+, also state the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC movement to "immediately remove all mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials including (its) websites".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over ownership of the trademark to legitimate owners."
If you fail to do so, we will appeal to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories point out.
In their letter, they state that UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recalls that Mr. Morin and his friends "chose "to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, like others in 2002, to establish a UMP.
According to them, the Nouveau Centre has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to create a committee in charge of defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when it registered the trademark", was not "for three years a member of the UDF" but UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used the non-existent registration of an acronym to do so on his own account.
This intactness begins to be transformed into a crime, they declare, and then express with irony on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life, it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to emerge from anonymity by fraudulently accepting a name to which we have no right."
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of a state of weakness.
A court in Nanterre on Friday decided to trial of the artist François-Marie Banier and hand down a ruling on whether he had used the eighty-year-old billionaire's condition to deprive her of part of her fortune, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames.
The photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of famous people, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, a crime for which a sentence of 3 years is imposed and a fine of 375 000 euros.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in the case, which can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter attack each other and fight to manage the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, who should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the prosecutor's office in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by March 10, 2010, while also giving a statement whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness, and in which period.
I think he'll undergo it.
I'll talk to her about the matter, Ms. Bettencourt's attorney, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for the lawyer François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
It is excellent news(...). Expertise will show that he manipulated this old lady who needs protection (M. Banier), confirmed.
It has been two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter opened criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-artist, whom she blames for years using her mother's state of weakness to obtain a gift of a billion euros in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or images of masters.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit filed by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's court speech by attorneys sometimes turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she expressed her distrust of Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the attorney, adds: "you could explain to my daughter that I have been texting Banier for fifteen years once or twice a day.
I've never been able to talk to François since she got married."
The prosecutor's office in Nanterre again found that the complainant's conduct was not justified, all the more so because the guardianship judge in those days rejected her request to initiate proceedings for legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely able to participate in the court, not under protection even in custody.
No one else will act for her,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, a prosecutor.
The court ultimately ruled that it would comment on Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers's legitimacy at the time of the trial to begin.
The management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been unnecessary...
For more than a decade, the behaviour of the management of large companies towards employees has been reminiscent of the approach of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: the point is that co-workers identify with the "values" determined from the mountain, as was the case before, when it was necessary to impose products on the consumer that came from the ideas of the heads of factory technicians.
By becoming a hub of business companies, the marketing revolution has leveled the market mining strategy in the right direction...although authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, are regularly returning!
A passive attitude by employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that hits mostly management cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires an active approach and the ability to anticipate" from all stakeholders (...) and requires employees to make commitments that are completely contrary to the revenues of authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call for a management revolution, which should aim to put workers at the center of interest of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will contribute to the revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to... what it always did!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the seriousness of one’s own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are university graduates for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of their thought comfort, they adopt an old behavioral theory, currently revived by "neuroscience" from the U.S. and widely disseminated without much knowledge by scientific institutes and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the "levers" (sic) involvement of managers, a recent survey by the agency Ipsos showed on the website Figaro.fr, which only confirms the managers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, presupposes the acceptance of the ultimate vision of human behavior.
It consists in the integration of basic observation into all the intentions and practices of management : For employees, commitments to the enterprise will only be possible if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only studies of Motivational Functional Analysis deal with this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doxy that allows them, through an image that tells them about the business, to evaluate what it offers to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate on their "social performances" and put their human resources management "on the right path."
This creates a breeding ground for the development of a solid and effective economic intelligence.
With a speech from Oslo: "just war" Obama has earned praise from the right.
The U.S. right on Friday welcomed a speech that Barack Obama delivered the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner advocated the concept of a "just war" against enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who initially mocked the award to Obama 9. October, this time the presidential speech was applauded, including Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a muse of the right-wing Republican wing, to USA Today, adding that she herself had commented on the issue of the "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs that are just coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans would like to have on their jobs, but it is necessary.
All terrorists must be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo justified the deployment of forces and used the speech to clarify his decision to send another 30 000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the president's mention of "the existence of evil in the world."
In a way, I considered this speech to be completely historic, Gingrich declared during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway."
The former MP, whom some consider a possible Republican nominee in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the "left-wing president" reminding members of the Nobel Prize committee ," that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the prize for peace if the use of forces did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, former author of the speeches of George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a "very American speech."
Not only did he introduce himself as a "world citizen" as always, but "he spoke as US president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they themselves have not created, and that they do not do too much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few disgruntled from the right is the Bush era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who described the speech as "monomonous, pompous and uninspired," as he said on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified at the sight of Barack Obama justifying the use of forces.
"If we wrap the war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-left press takes a commendable position on the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the awarding of peace to Obama premature, he rated his output as "overperformance" even for a speaker known for his talents.
The speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California daily reported.
Obama "uttered the speech as needed," the New York Times said, calling the speech "simple and instructive."
Road carriers: three marathons to an agreement that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiating marathons, the road carriers union and the TLF, the only employer organization left until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended a call for a strike and a threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "joy" during Friday's signing of the agreement after several negotiations that began Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussion, the negotiators broke up early on Friday morning with the hope that the wording of the agreement would be signed as quickly as possible at the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned from the meeting.
But it took more than six hours of the meeting, which began at 11 a.m. to get everyone to agree and to sign the agreement at 18 o'clock.
This conflict "would hurt businesses greatly" and "there would be a danger that the holidays will be disrupted at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight, we'll give our members an order not to blockade, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may still be a few opponents who are not satisfied,' he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal," although it was hard to admit to raising high salaries given the international competition ".
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros a month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement."
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise."
The agreement also foresees a 3% revaluation of travel expenses and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of 100 million euros in taxes on the wages of businesses" which was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 bill, which was voted on on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for an "consistent" vote.
The signing allows this agreement to apply first to businesses that are members of that organization, later to the entire field, in the case of extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "in the shortest possible time," Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be hindered by disagreement by employers' organizations.
The FNTR talks about "bad trade" because 100 million euros have already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to conduct an emergency not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger the turkey eaters during the upcoming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For the Otre organisation, the deal threatens to "bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry" in the next 12 months.
Suburban trains RER A: interruption of transport at the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The interruption of traffic on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's talks between the unions and the RATP management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the issue of a request for a premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 a.m. and 20 p.m., on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every second train will run, outside this section only one train out of four.
The connection with SNCF will be cut in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Galeries Lafayette department stores, which expect more than 200 000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP was trying to provide a connection with large department stores."
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Parisian agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in operation at rush hour, and virtually no train was running at off-peak time, as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station than usual, among other things because pupils and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he had risen an "hour and a half early to be sure he was coming in time."
The Saint-Lazare railway station was not crowded, the SNCF state railway announced, as a greater number of order guards and guards were predicted.
Suburban RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut were arriving or departing from Saint-Lazare Station with a connection to the metro.
Further general gatherings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the leadership, which the unions rated as "weak."
The management of the RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban RER A trains in all aspects, adjustment of working hours, career progress, etc.
However, this is not the point for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (UnionsSouth).
RATP has even postponed proposals for the premium for the time being, which scandalized the CGT, saying the management "was unable to solve the problem while for travel carriers and SNCF it went."
At the new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, the conditions for the exercise of the profession will be "readmilly," the RATP transport companies specified.
Which was why trade unionists think the business is "making fun of weekend travelers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the corporate committee at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which until now has rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of "reassure".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independents announce a strike emergency.
The unions are asking for a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, including 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independents)) and complain about the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which carry a million passengers daily.
ReR train drivers earn between 2200 and 2700 euros of gross wages and 600 to 650 euros of premiums for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish judiciary dissolved for the Kurdish side, and this decision has severe consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday ruled on the abolition of the country's main pro-Kurdish party. The decision immediately sparked protest demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of a government that seeks to lend a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority-seven votes were needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres including its president, Ahmet Türk, and MP Aysela Tuglukova are banned from participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity used by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party leadership warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as MPs without political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of a trial launched in 2007 by prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obedience to the "orders" of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that the DTP is a legal political display case for the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic connection" with the PKK but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government gives a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and attempts to limit the support of Kurds against the PKK to end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where many demonstrations have degenerated in recent weeks against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is detained in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the decision of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is inhabited mostly by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or fired rocks from slingshots.
About a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict was handed down, Mr Türk said the decision of justice would only "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are on principle against the interference of the parties.
It doesn't solve anything, energy minister Taner Yildiz said.
The decision is a complete blast of democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the most deadly attacks in northern Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come
A pretty crunchy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the FES's winter technical services department.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is following a precise plan.
Once it snows all-over in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, they will roll out to 20 so-called sections of A large-scale spreader, Brauburger explains.
These sections include main and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with descending like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with a moist salt that holds better within a maximum of three hours, something about 1040 kilometers.
Therefore, the FES begins at three o'clock at night "to keep the roads free when the transport to work begins."
It's difficult when it starts snowing only at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make room for the sprinklers."
Only when it does not snow so much, are it the driveway and interconnection communications, which also include Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll complain there.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pawns will set out on the road, preferably clearing dangerous places and crossings.
The FES usually can't take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that monitors bridges primarily from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As the iceron forms quickly on them, the sprinklers leave immediately as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
The police will also call them if necessary.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like plenty of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, two metres long and 1.50 metres high, ran along two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, there would have been nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues wrote in Thursday's issue of the journal Science that Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body markings.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry region of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa is opening a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about kinship relationships, spreads, and the signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, this is unprecedented for the settlements from the triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The find confirms the theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual find: "The fossils of dinosaurs from the triassic are very rare, mostly only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts don't share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
In the current scientific view, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when the lizards were divided into the three most important lines of development: carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, "long-harver" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores Ornithischia (birds), which included, for example, the species Triceratops
Tawa hallae is the original therapist after analyzing Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced qualities, Nesbitt says.
On the Tawa hallae skull, researchers have found, for example, evidence of air bags, which even the descendants of the teropods have birds.
Thanks to airy bags, the breathing of birds is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, even the bones of the spine were obviously partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of huge sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation was probably already created by the common ancestor of the two groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far lived in South America, scientists concluded that the lizards first appeared there.
According to this, three development lines were divided soon and spread from South America to all continents that, as the Pangea supercontinent, formed a single earth mass.
The fact that the team, along with the Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related, theropods would also speak for it.
Those three can't come from one common, migrated ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could put together a distorted image, because in South America very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs have been preserved, with the other continents rarely ever found.
How dinosaurs proved that from a relatively rare secondary line of the genus of reptiles they evolved to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the time of the Earth's Middle Ages, it still remains a puzzle.
During the triassis, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Towards the end of the triassis, dinosaurs spread to the world and many new species evolved, while relatives died out and the triass and jury interfaces.
The history of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that dinosaurs happened to survive, but the reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better so they could push out the competition.
The history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, the meteorite impact helped another group of animals, which also evolved into a triasis and has lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
They joined associates with associates from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of Frankfurt's Goethe University's occupied casino has made a worldwide fuss.
278 professors and teachers of Goethe University, but also colleges across Germany, Europe and North and South America are in solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "do not approve" of the presidium's instigated police crackdown.
Because the walls and artworks were scribbled, university president Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied last week by striking students and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the case, the signatories say, do not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching by students and teachers by police commandos."
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable interference" in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "unjustify and criminalize protest" and distracts from the contents.
The presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The speakers are calling for a halt to criminal prosecutions.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support material damage.
Justified protest
The youth trade unions Verdi and the German Trade Union are also in solidarity with students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi's secretary of Earth's youth Alexander Klein.
Hessian Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is yet to defend the actions of the university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
The destruction and occupancy are completely unacceptable means, she said Thursday in Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) at the Wiesbaden Landstag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a member of the Diet of the Lands.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it.
The CDU is taking painted walls beyond the pretext to criminalise the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of addressing the arguments and demands of the learners, there was a vacancy.
Linke has filed a motion calling on the Home Secretary to report on police deployment.
The new Silicon-Valley
For many years, it was paid for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow's capital, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly guarded location where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district with 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the Moscow center, is considered a "Russian Silicon Valley."
There are important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers.
Since September 2008, the Green Grad representatives have established contacts with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the University Institutions and Companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow multi-mayor Yuri Roslyak and the prefect of Zelenograd, Anatoly Smirnov, for Frankfurt was signed by the leading planning officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in scientific research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
The Scientific Exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be allowed to take hold on to the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and societies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technique, the large Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Electronics.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape, in which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be prepared enough.
For supporters of the project, this is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
Okay. Okay. The S21 is more than the start-up of the station, more than a monstrous building that plunges the capital of Baden-Württemberg into desperate construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
The head stations with the tracks that ended in the city centre were then considered to be the transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as the brakes of modern rail transport, because it took enormous time to switch the locomotives from the front.
Go, stop for a while, drive on - that's how it should work.
And that's why the head stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about halfway down the route of the trans-European railway highway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan about the "heart of Europe".
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 80's are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves recognized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities the start of construction is almost unfinanciable.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, head stations have no longer had problems with detouring and driving out.
Still: Starting with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE track to Ulm.
This was promoted by the provincial and local politicians.
The railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Czech Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state concern.
Urbanistically, the project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we believe the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
The S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The drive-through station and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which - typically in the 80's - was attributed to a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must primarily be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight transport on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
Even more serious is that the S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros was to be buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts consider it a real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, finances for more nodal points and bottlenecks in the network will be lacking.
There are sixty larger projects on the Department of Transportation list.
One of the most important is the construction of a roughly 180-kilometer-long route through the Rhine Valley.
It has been building on this route at a slow pace since 1987.
It would be necessary to push hard here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The track through the Rhine Valley will become the throat of a bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines airport ruling
The Land Government has opened the Wiesbaden Landstag to see if it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and have it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has instructed experts to legally assess the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today reasoned in writing that the state would have to newly adjust the nightly flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway of Frankfurt Airport.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as assumed by the provincial government, does not correspond to the legally ordered protection of the population from nighttime aerial noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to demand a review of the verdict.
The opposition criticized this postponement and was hitting on the government's representatives to renounce the revision of the Leipzig Federal Administrative Court.
The head of the SPD faction, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, has called on the CDU and the FDP to return to promises to ban night flights before the election. Otherwise, it can be considered a "violation of a given word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP's election slogan "We keep the word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's rebuke, the provincial government is trying to get to its night flights through "threating law and tricks."
Exact legal control takes its time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a realistic decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
His factions to ban night flights have never been as the opposition is handing them over.
US banks are paying back aid
American, crisis-shaken big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America repaid aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund on Wednesday totalling $45 billion (around $30 billion).
According to a report by US broadcaster CNBC, Citigroup also plans to repay state aid.
The constitutions thus want to get rid of the restrictions that have been imposed by the receipt of money - the restriction of bonus payments to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has received 19 billion dollars of net money from investors thanks to exchangeable bonds.
She took the rest of the amount from her cash register, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trade union sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday night explicitly thanked the US taxpayer: The cash injection helped us to overcome a difficult time.
The money institution hurt itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by procuring money on the capital market.
CNBC reported that the U.S. bank could announce a capital increase of around $20bn on Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment on this.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid their aid in June.
A quick choice
It went faster than expected.
The station unveiled a successor just two weeks after the ZDF board pushed editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office.
Last night, the committee wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital in Berlin, was the favourite.
However, the station did not confirm this - officially, so as not to overtake the process.
However, the role may have also been played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if this proposal had not passed with the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the committee.
The result of the vote was not known before the deadline for this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender's loss of his mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it was to be expected.
The EU's majority on the board signaled a few weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The resistance to the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He rejected further remaining in the office of the highly esteemed editor by arguing that under Brender, quotas of watching ZDF's news broadcasts fell.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
The last time 35 state lawyers, who rate Koch's actions as unconstitutional, were mixed into the debate.
It was no use.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal."
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal officer editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy ZDF; since then head of the main study of ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected a journalist of the year by the expert magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's opponent on the board, Rhine-Palatine Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state treaty with ZDF so that the personnel proposals of the intendant could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from ZDF's supervisory boards.
Brender's presumed successor, Peter Frey, commanded the board with a clever chess move - immediately after the deposed Brender was heavily criticised by the committee.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could be nominated to the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face by both Schächter and could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that the party member would be pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is ranked as left-wing liberals anyway.
Studying gets rid of junk
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, culture ministers finally went to the federal states on Thursday: At a conference of culture ministers and university rectors, both sides agreed that there was a will to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the load on the exams: In principle, each study module should be terminated by one single test.
In addition, the workload of the students should be checked and a "real and defensible measure" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal States undertake to create a more flexible common structural assignment for bachelor's and master's degree courses.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer tests
Since the start of the student protests in the worm, culture ministers and university rectors have had winged words in their mouths about better study.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided that the number of exams would be partially drastically reduced: "Each module will usually be completed with only one examination," reads a 30-page report, which is intended in part to re-regulate the approval of study fields.
"A significantly lower test burden," said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, "to be stopped the flawed development, which significantly limited the difficulty of studying."
To do this, the "demands of study" in the future should be a "decisive criterion" in implementation.
Both the modules and the contents "must be severely rechecked" so that "they do not unnecessarily limit the students when choosing
seminars."
Students would have "a claim to a space that allows and supports their own initiative."
The rules should apply when approving new fields of study, but after review, but also for existing fields of study.
These need to be "reaccredited" every five years - but this means that it will take until 2015 before all fields of study are reviewed.
There are ten accreditation agencies responsible throughout Germany for this, which are subject to the accreditation councils established by the Länder.
Culture ministers called on the Länder to "strongly" affect agencies in October so that the curriculum content is not too large and the exam regime is not strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities have already agreed with the regional ministries on appropriate measures.
As a single country so far, the Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional resources for the further development of the Bologna Process.
From the money, universities should primarily pay for consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen the examination and foreign authorities.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
In early 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the higher education law.
According to her, only one exam should be needed to terminate the study module.
The formation of studies should be even more flexible, the recognition of examinations from other universities should be guaranteed and the access to the master should be made easier.
The complexity of all fields of study in the country should be checked by the end of next year.
The government and opposition were arguing again on Thursday about the country's study conditions.
In addition to praise, criticism of the resolution also fell.
The Federal Board of Directors of the university groups Juso called for the creation of education policy not to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word should speak into it" also students as concerned persons.
The future academics also received support from the president of the conference of university rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantelová: "We need the experience of students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: They demand a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access the extension master’s degree.
Second, the federal states must ensure that enough places in master's fields of study with the best possible study conditions are available for today's generation of bachelor's degree students tomorrow, said GEW Board Member Andreas Keller.
The federal states must employ far more speakers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on free access to the Master’s programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of one poem by the poet Werner Söllner, who in this torn language piece is themed by the experience of arriving a dissident who gained his freedom, but at the same time lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first working as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publishing house, and 1982 moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner was awarded various literary prizes, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
He took care of the considerable extra-literary commotion last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security acts."
Apparently unsure and taken aback, Söllner left a statement in which fellow writers of Romanian Germans, among others. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, admits to working together as a secret informant for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts to recruit began inconspicuously, at the earliest in 1971.
I'm, Söllner continued, "that is, someone who has not resisted enough attempts to intimidate by Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent, Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary dealing with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors coming from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and shamefulness of the political system, which is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least, if it can be said according to the state of knowledge to date, only the perpetrator, but he is also a victim.
In the acts of Securitate, secret agent Walter played a role, Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive effect on himself by secret agent Walter.
He was "cutting" me at the time on all the essential points for him, Markel says.
He has a moral obligation to make that remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and in front of this audience, but it is not a completely surprising confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when she read her own acts, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Securitate spies.
Touching, one can assume, they will speculate, and in some cases probably even know which name is behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Other than in the domestic, meanwhile, a very certain inspection of the Stazi components, the manipulation with the estate of control of the Securitate is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic awareness has been thwarted and curtailed.
One of the Birthler Offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the processing of the Securitate (CNSAS) components, was founded only in 1999, the release of the act has been rather lengthy since then.
It is only since 2005 that there has been a law that governs the management of the files.
The former members of Securitate still have a great influence in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, was evidenced by one interview in which one of the former bosses of Securitate of Timisoara expressed his rejection of the award winner.
She says she has psychosis, after all, she was only interviewed once.
The disgrace of power here has been expressed quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as in the context of the concealed wrongdoing, is connected with the inevitable issues.
Why now? Who was harmed? The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession is to be expected that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the desire for knowledge rather than for the admission of guilt and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Champions League Saturated Deposit
It looked as if a clean-dressed sales representative from a cute Christmas party had been handing out the sporting goods maker sweets as he boarded a quarter of an hour after midnight in the summoned Mercedes of Class C-Class new coach VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored sponsor's bag. ̈
A man with a significant baldness was driven around a foreign city because of him.
Otherwise he could drive alone - alcohol was not in play, and drunken happiness was a 55-year-old man also little.
It was a pleasant evening, but it will continue to work tomorrow.
Or it'll just start.
In the words of the three-day Swiss engaged: "We have reached the eight-finals" in the Champions League thanks to the win3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: It will be a brutally tough fight against the descent."
"A far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mainz the performance from the royal class even on an ordinary league day.
And to prevent obvious weaknesses again after three quick goals by Marica (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Drawing
Champions League eight-finals (Match 16/17. + 23/24 February/ rematch 9./10. + 16/17 March) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of the banging rise of Babbel's successor will therefore be preserved.
Not only in the supposed healer, who gave the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in a short time confidence, willingness to be deployed and the joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and I urged them to be more courageous, explained the healer of the souls of Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, however, did not prove any effectiveness under the influence of the therapist Babbel.
He stirred up some magic, admitted Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a week-long break caused by injury, became the best player on the field thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the found "phenomenon" of the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working practices of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
It was obviously missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart, however, needs more permanence.
Like Gross, even players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened replacement and utterly overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow even before the ugly wake-up call came after a 0:4 defeat at Leverkusen, Khedira is considering.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt recalled that although one goal in the season was achieved, the other is still a long way off.
We're not out of the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate on his 40th birthday even after his first home win after three months was due to the weekend's events, which freshly came to life in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions made by others and not Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He was throwing the board of directors a weak lead and decided to change coach after pressure from teenage fans.
Even the fact that his free day after the games was cancelled was described by Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's remarks "formulate pure egoism," Heldt replied, announcing the consequences for the goalkeeper.
The two in their 40s will probably no longer be happy about life.
Anyway, they are one with the others, that without the work of the deposed coaching team, it would not be possible to perform so strong and combative.
Babbel and his assistants had a "big share of success," say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
Heavyweight World Championship fight
A passionate duel in Bern: Invoicer Kevin Johnson has constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitaly Klitschko.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title to the WBC boxing organization.
The judges' statement was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains world heavyweight boxing champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat American Kevin Johnson unanimously on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night.
For Klitschko, it is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC organizations.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out the k.o. that everyone was expecting.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice being defeated due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th duel.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese arena, the 2.02-meter-high Klitschko was fighting mainly with his left hand.
The eleven-centimeter-size-year-old Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was withdrawing from the world champion's strikes, so Klitschko could not strike the decisive blow with his dangerous right.
In total, passive Johnson did quite a little on the challenger and was just trying to get to the next rounds.
Although he provoked his words and gestures, his punches rarely hit the world champion.
But even so, he's only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klitschko for a full twelve rounds.
The challenger took care of the commotion in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted the Klitschko as a "detached zombie" who "can't do anything properly."
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion allowed himself to be provoked, pulling Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitschko remained even after the fourth fight after his return 11. Unbeaten October 2008.
After a nearly four-year break, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight before.
That year, he beat Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreol of the US in September during the defence of the title.
I only got one shot in this fight and I'm physically in good shape, Klitschko reasoned a quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt is worn by British David Haye, after dethroning 2.13-meter-high Nikolai Vulayev in November.
Haye renounced a duel against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
He is reportedly planning a duel against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz Case
Head attack from opposition: Greens faction chief Jürgen Trittin has called the defence minister Guttenberg a liar because of bad information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the chancellor to give explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz raid, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a conscious deception.
The minister said "consciously untrue" to the deadly bombing of two tankers in September, Greens faction chief Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday's ARD news show "Tagesschau."
Let's call it the usual expression: Lied.
The order for killing was issued in disregard for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the essence of the report that NATO had that was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In a U.S. raid demanded by German commander Kunduz colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak out immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Ms Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Bundestag - and whether the Office of the Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, called on Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly dismissed the criticism.
The chancellor's office does not affect the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
There were also doubts aloud on Saturday about the ministry's account of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenberg were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tankers.
It was officially said to deny the existence of NATO reports and to obscure the minister's sensitive details.
However, it was said from the vicinity of the two top officials that they had alerted the Ministry of Defence even to several reports, among them a two-page document commanding Colonel Klein and one report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert, meanwhile, should have asked in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The ministry did not comment on the complaints on Saturday, pointing out that this will be dealt with in the Investigative Committee of the Bundestag, which will be established next Wednesday.
The worlds of dreams
Some see images in the waking state and hear voices that others cannot see and hear.
Not only the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication merge the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with the wildest imaginations and fantasy mirages.
But those who experience dreamlike states in mindfulness, see and hear things that others cannot see and hear, in today’s Western world, mostly pay for a fool or drug addict, or at least as a weirdo.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, will make sure that the boundaries between dream, fantasy and reality merge here and there.
Dreams an altered state of consciousness can occur in all sorts of forms, at best we call them visions, at worse delusions.
Although the initiator and the effect may differ, however, the vision of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of delirium, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise when the balance of neuronal brain transmitters occurs - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and vicious thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity doesn't have power over him
The connection between error and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, said in 1861 "a great similarity of delirium with dreamlike states," for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, mirages, deception of the senses."
It's Fall 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and garishly coloured.
Gravity has no power over him, it floats at the ceiling of the room.
He feels kicked.
Behind him, winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, valuing teeth.
He chases it, kicks him with heavy, fire boots, throws him against the wall, feels pain on his whole body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from walls and from the radio.
He can no longer endure the voices that scold and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, knots them in a loop and fixes it on a hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one speaker and puts a noose around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop permits.
Learn, shouting the choir voices tearing his drums, "go to the clinic and get treatment!"
Today is Henningu T. 40 years, he experienced six acute psychoses, the last 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoic psychosis, besides, he is manic-depressive, he takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's married for three years.
In psychosis, I've experienced the worst fear and deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible fact
About one percent of people get schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the disability can no longer distinguish the internal and external world, they get into an over-excited state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
A particularly widespread is the hearing of votes - votes that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out the disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just as a dream opens the psychosis of the flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed to him.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible for them, ghosts are a terrible fact, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucination
Other than in a dream, says Fuchss, "but the sensory and spatial structure of reality that a person perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience occurs in a real framework.
Scientists are always faced with the puzzle of why our brains do such overshoots.
Exceptional conditions can lead to the short-term relationship to reality, Fuchs says.
But not everyone develops into psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
The researchers assume that the affected person has minimal brain damage.
We believe that at an early stage of development, there will be damage to the neuronal maturation of the brain, for example, by the mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
However, it remains a puzzle of how the neuronal system, which has not manifested itself for many years, will be malfunctioned.
The influences of the environment also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if there is a disposition to it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains boil
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive mirages as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often only a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and mirages for a decade, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucinations are typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders such as borderline personality or depression, often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, it hallucinates the brain of a healthy person under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the content of ideas that are normally suppressed.
They arise when parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or little suppressed; if our brain becomes welded, or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worrying about love or other other exceptional conditions.
In more recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah is Sarah K. 16 years old, he lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the local grammar school.
A normal girl, actually.
If only there were no patterns and voices.
During breaks, it may happen that she will be approached by a collagote with long, dark hair.
When she answers him, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her can see and hear this boy.
This timid girl is considered an uptight dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
He's awake, he hears and he sees the boy, just like he hears and sees a girl sitting next to each other in a bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a pleasant feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, he sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other mirages are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather daunting
Often, mirages are a burden.
When he's sitting in class, he can't watch the lessons many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else audibly and visibly on the board of the mathematical equation.
At night, the appearances are rather daunting.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or asleep, whether the images she sees, grimaces, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and feet, arise before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at those characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she hasn't gone mad.
Miracles are also an art out of despair
If someone is socially isolated or has been taken away from him by stimuli, he will be very likely to have hallucinations, Kasten says.
I think the brain doesn't have enough jobs and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of the other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she has been calling her dad since she was thinking was not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain regions, which also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, also the reality is displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that let the brain arise, that's why it acts so real."
Also, night dreams evaluate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people does not differ fundamentally from hallucination in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Therefore, Kasten advises its patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Borderline between dream and hallucination
In our world focused too much on the note, the imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief medical officer of Florence-Nightingale Hospital's Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, tormented disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - mirage is also an art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard explored the so-called oneiroidal form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the affected person considers real and can not even retroactively distinguish them from the waking state.
The oneiroidal state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps by the continuing, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A type of borderline state between a dream and a hallucination.
Since it is not possible to manage a situation in reality, there will be a change in worlds, but the real situation will become present in the imagination.
An intense form of support for the senses and the transfer of the senses in some unbearable situation that allows us people to self-shape, to move into a loss of consciousness in a moment.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also, art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroidal experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Heart Exchange) as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 when, after heart valve surgery with a subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness set out on a several-day journey, with his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into the world he had created, visited foreign times and places: He became an old man confined to his bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, which produces narcotic substances from blood.
On a motorbike, a Greek kidnaps him in his homeland, surfs a hospital bed in a company in the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It plunges completely into the imaginary action, everything is real, even later in the memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, memories from those mental journeys are still clear after years and in insignificant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show the oneiroidal states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile our internal images of external reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten summarizes, "can lead to the deformation of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
At 27, children are to be taken over by the publishing house
The new head of Kallen Publishing is a transitional solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding will also belong to a family of 100 percent in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda has long seen his business in the hands of his children.
Both children will be inherited at 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says SPIEGEL's 69-year-old man.
We have dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked afterward.
The question of whether they have the skills to do so.
It is not possible to put their children at the head of 7500 employees if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both children and business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had been withdrawing from the chairmanship of the board since January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burdy since 1999.
At first, he was in charge of technology.
Later, the Cash Register section added responsibility for the company’s assets and, after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also Direct Marketing, Foreign Affairs, Print and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen is also used to "bridge 10, 15 years," Burda said.
Holding should still belong to a 100 percent family in the future, Burda says.
In view of the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses were not sure about the demise: "It has always touched companies that have been infected with the desire for capital they have speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power," Burda argues.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time," these deals are too big.
Comprehensive beauty care
Everything you can wish for in the field of beauty and well-being is within your hands.
This was demonstrated by El Corte Inglés, which has just launched the Callao (Madrid) shopping center with an area of more than 1000 m2, which provides a variety of body care services.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor, home to such prestigious companies as Hedonai dealing with laser depilation-; Spaxión, spaces for relaxation and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or with gym orL'Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and more.

Escotes variados
Christmas is approaching and this is the time when it is advisable to find out what celebrities wear and adapt your festive wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which is necessary to be aware of.
We present several proposals.
The singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We don't recommend.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with Barcelona City Hall, founded the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE' (Logistics for the Introduction of Electric Vehicles) sets out and will manage the travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will ensure mobility agreements, handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, gather opinions and results in the participating sectors.
Overall, the purpose is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
These are the three cities elected by the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with the participation of Endesa in terms of the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero anticipates the 'quiet period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the state's main export sector, is facing a "rest period."
In the Prime Minister's 2009 economic report, Zapatero summarized the measures that were put in place during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a competitive plan for the automotive sector, we would face a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our major manufacturing companies,” he said.
"Thanks to this plan and the wishes of individual brands, to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm is foreseen in the future for this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he noted that the competing plan, which forms part of the Automotive Integral Plan (PIA), has designated 800 million for projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary firms that have mobilised an investment in excess of 3 billion euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures to support the requirement and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being applied in cooperation with autonomous regions and automotive brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed to reduce the average emission level for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and ensured a "significant increase" in the registrations, specifically in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, which is a space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place on days 5. - 7. February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of Madrid Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20 000 square meters, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real treats for collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialized firm of Mercedes Benz.
Exterior Efficiency Tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports performances, tests of competence, presentations and auditions.
There will also be performance of competence tests for classic cars and motorcycles in a customized circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining a sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative effect on sports style.
And that's why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - also baptized as a-stop-, which is a device that is currently only available with a 2.0 150-hp gasoline engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics, which it achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent for Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver's seat, have excellent ergonomics and are superbly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely fine.
Using the tool assembly and console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese tendency to develop a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style partly reminds us of the style also presented by the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, more specifically, withVolkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As is usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention the large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic stop and start-up system of the engine is currently only available with a petrol engine for two liters and 150 horsepower with a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise levels, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive so many kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater comfort when driving and reduced consumption.
In terms of equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For serial equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the Lane Monitoring System (RVM), which prevents the appearance of a blind spot, tension and stability control, speed control, interior mirror sensitive to light, on-board computer with large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels made of 17-inch alloy.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an extra charge of 1,500 euros: adaptable lights two-xenon and sound system BOSE with CD holder, in addition to other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
Moreover, people who do not drive more kilometers per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with a gasoline engine2.0 and 150 hp.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is 21,770 euros for the Luxury design and 23.270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L. A. has a red carpet, as fine as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled more than ever in the brand's new elegant and sexy 'Nine' models. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'lady'.
Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is used only to view mail, without the ability to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine recognized him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, but for which it is necessary to pay six times the amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was unveiled yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It is limited just like his American counterpart, but he brings surprises.
The monthly price for maintenance is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People travelling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or eagerly looking for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to view the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for the reduction of roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that it continues to have the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) achieves this type of tariff, means that operators start to think differently and consider different offers to compensate for their data network.
The Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is paid for when purchased, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to come once in the case ofFonPeek, this is the possibility of buying with permanent access like Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from a consumer point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color that Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady USA.
To take office as President of Barack Obama, she chose a dress and a coat in this color, and she chose the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to the fact that it is a similar color - yellow-green with sparkling effects - in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat made of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, the first lady of the U.S. decided to follow in the footsteps of an Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothes are made makes both models considerably different.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium-high heel, now a similar model, but in gold color.
He also wears various hairstyles: this time a drdolle, previously loose hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger years who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and Working Career of Spanish Women', conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75, and the results are unambiguous: 75% of working mothers have limited labour market opportunities because of motherhood.
The study highlights that at the beginning of coexistence there are many differences in opinion about the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also by the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have stable jobs, start living with their partner early, previously give birth to their first child and overall have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, put off partnership and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years of age with a stable job have their first child on average 3.7 years old from the start of coexistence with a partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving their stable employment and have therefore had to postpone the coexistence and arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less influence on the time of coexistence with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, who is engaged in research in the CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage the birth of a child is the degree of education.
The research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 or. 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education are married and give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or high education proceed the other way to obtain a stable job, to marriage and to the birth of their first child.”
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of female representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The presenter 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, thus joins other famous personalitiesL'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Even before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('The Millionaire of the Shack') joined this selected club.
The men's part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most prominent representatives - designers and models, both former and current - met at a year-long awards ceremony held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
There was no lack of choice at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of writers he has encountered in his literary life (and in some cases in everyday life) in 'Esa poker' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente).
It does not do so in dreaded and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and Vicent doesn't spare any scare or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader’s enjoyment, even with repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "In the pages of this book, I have found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but the spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be named: the enjoyment of the anti-destiny, the morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not his intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man has been braced with a passion for this woman for all thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by the path of damnation."
James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature, which must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often collapse."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird man.
On his own, he said he was the heir to a landlord from the county, and sometimes that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, these were great dreams.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured on the bridge a madman cry of this man from Munich to carry his echo into the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running away from himself and calling out for the future and speaking violently to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed, 'Oh my beloved, make sure I stop writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "Spenser's verses were engraved on his grave: 'After the effort comes the dream,/ after the storm a peaceful harbor,/after the war rest,/after a full life death."
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
The husband completely agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing Greek.
Never before has a man been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with folly.”
About Pia Baroja: "What else was it about Martín Santos but to focus Joyce on Baroi?
What was Benet's mind but to have Baroi executed by Faulkner's weapon?
What was it about Celo but to be famous at the expense of the man's glory?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 went through the round and our dog, a cross between the rescuer and a maximum of six kilograms, without a word kicked him twice and badly injured.
Our outrage is all the greater because we don't see anything fun in such aggression towards a small and defenseless animal that was additionally on a leash.
And on top of that, the old lady's shock after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, began to fear for her own safety, for such a devil-obsessed man who attacked the animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint against the nearest commissary, but we doubt that this was for anything, and in order not to raise sensitive questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
The outrage prompted us to announce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with today's youth when they're having fun by worrying about the defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where the right manners have gone, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, mainly among younger motorists, as both of these entities have reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only means by which head injuries can be prevented, where appropriate, from dying in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of their obligations on transport safety, which "means more than designing and producing even safer products" and confirmed that it is trying to fulfill this purpose in a different way, i.e. in the form of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets when riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase where notice boards will be deployed to more than 500 motorcycle repairs to reach the awareness of the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety "is a constant problem" of this company, which is the manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main goal is to constantly increase the safety of products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and what is more, this is the first increase after 22 months of sustained decline, according to figures from the patronage organization of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam dealers.
However, the favourable figure is better to quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and has meant a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months accounts for 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick ups, deliveries, smaller trucks and light trucks/chassis.
And the gloom that most damages demand, even when bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies, and in almost 100% of cases it is financing through third parties.
Other factors such as a halt or a continuation of the bad economic situation should also be added to the constraints resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In the given situation, unlike passenger cars, the support of buying the 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention the persons doing business on the trade license of a small and medium-sized company, which intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with CO2 emission levels not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam, they again reminded that it is necessary to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (bushes and buses).
The Association of Dealers expects that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to calculations, sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the handbrake is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, it will also be with the stability control of the ESP, the assistant systems of the handbrake, all this will become the mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others, a deadline is set to eliminate the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measure introduced in the EU aims to increase pedestrian protection, working to help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary system of the handbrake increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency case, which the system detects after the driver is pressed.
But he can't always sustain that pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by auto parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident did not brake before the collision, and half of them did not fully use the brake strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 pedestrian-related fatalities could be avoided.
The reduction in this number will be even more noticeable-according to the calculations would prevent one of four accidents with an impact on people-after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) captures obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him to increase the pressure on the pedal if needed.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will impress the brake as intensely as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April -probably on April 8-, as reported by Javier Ortega, the U.S. manufacturer cautions that it will need more time to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that every point of the plan is first agreed with the party involved.
And as a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the staff and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, by contrast, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken these days.
Not surprisingly, the Swedish government has increased the pressure on U.S. manufacturers to take some decisions as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer, Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of the assets of Saab to Chinese company Baic.
It continues to be valid for the decision to close at the end of the year if it fails to sell it.
Driving with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this magnificent model, the engineers from Porsche used the Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only1.275 kg.
On the basis of this, the automatic drawstring roof is in a canvas version with manual control, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; aluminium doors such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to a reduction in weight of another 7 kg; after the installation of sports seats an additional 12 kg, thanks to a lightweight 19-inch wheeled additional five kilos.
And finally, the removal of the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also offered with a dual-clutch PDK transmission, one vehicle with a hand-shifted six-speed speed box, mainly on second-class roads in California, has been tested on mountain sections with many intricate corners.
His behavior can only be qualified as inviolable.
Reducing weight does not mean that the vehicle does not press against the asphalt.
On the contrary, we have not tested such a small and light model for a long time, which would also transfer such safety when moving in a corner, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete capable of warming up his muscles during a short ride for the necessary time until we order him to sprint, brake, and restore the use of the engine...
Whatever we want. Thanks to the steering, which is as communicative as accurate, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel, is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound according to will
The sound of the V6 boxer, about 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and it is possible to enhance it with the possibility of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used at the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether when suctioned or recuperation.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we're passing through with the Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and yet in some corners we came across at dawn on icing and gravel even on an advanced morning.
Definitely this ultralight car is one of the most entertaining on the market, as it is a little more than a mere modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Girlfriend Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon series and the occasional 'starlette' at the 'firm' shows, the singer shows off her evil girl's face as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia claimed victory in Israel
The workmanship scored a brilliant victory in 82-91 while hosting the complicated Maccabi Electra course, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus took the lead of their group after a big performance by Mirza Teletovice, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the squad (29 ratings).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, great accuracy from the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match began head-on for the blues, who stood up to the mark from the start.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from afar already suggested that they had attacked the Israeli squad very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavian team opted for the internal game of Barac and the work of Eliyah, which was received by whistling and applause when returning to its original location to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to show up as the best in his team with 13 points, although 'without six' when evaluating Splitter already suggested that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the Macabees wanted to remind Victoria that not everyone was winning on their pitch, and they were able to win with the hand of Elías.
Eidson and Pnini have definitely contributed to making the 'yellow' back in the limelight (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, injured but not dead at all, needed several accurate games to take their breath, and then a machine gun Mirza Teletovic appeared, who three triples almost in succession and with the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which reached the local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavas have rubbed their skins in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to deprive them of the well-deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the squad alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter ruled out for the foul seIvanovic did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis came close to the final minute (80-85), the match already had the winner aTel Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos and left him the lead of Group B in the Euroleague in a match marked by three attacks by Unicajo, but above all by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) that facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or the opponent, perhaps one of the more sick in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. The aggressive defence and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, lit up the pitch with 12-18, a minute's 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja , although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, a minute 13, which was the moment when the fight between the supports of USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek squad began to function and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to an injury to Joel Freeland and three personal errors by Carlos Jiménez were weighed down by the Unicaja squad
Between the inside players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas with triple points, they increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible retaliation
The third part was very attacking from Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, proved the upper hand and even managed to match the difference from the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48, a minute 27 that shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja struggled to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Roberto Archibald, who injured himself in the last match.
Despite all the drawbacks, Unicaja, thanks to the lead and three-pointed Cook and Lewis's contribution, she left some hope for a 66-57 win, a minute's 31.
But it was virtually impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to strengthening and superiority in centimeters in his zone, proved he was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalise the basket average 81-62, a minute 37, and Unicaja withered and handed over the lead to Olympiacos.

During the week the app works, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "feels poorly rewarded," Albert Rivera, in his report, explained in his report, responsible for the product Trovit.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes 45,226 euros gross annually and France's 31,059, while the Spaniard receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid job in Spain is the waiter's work with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by a salesman with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are the driver, half-time employment and social worker.
Brazil set date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy by that date, where he has been sheltering since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek other refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman as confirming his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 election (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum that the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, tried to impose on him.
Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in an environment where executives take decisions about a future that is in itself uncertain.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was to monetize debt directly by buying assets and indirectly freeing liquidity at a zero-door rate so that financial institutions could buy assets to deduct.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have already virtually ended, and without questioning their disparate liquidity policy, are starting to throw a little sand into gears, as the Spanish central bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we participate in the return of the reduction of risk returns.
The stock exchange's mobility and the corporate bond differences regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again touched public debt.
Once again, it is pushing for quality, and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven chosen by investors, expanding the differentiation of eurozone countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost not affected by this instability, but Standard & Poor's came in at the time and threatened a new revision to reduce the qualifications of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless for silencing moral risk advocates who have once again sought to burden the conscience of those responsible for world economic policy in order to hinder the devastating consequences of limiting credit to employment when, in fact, a new day of thanksgiving would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents tribal struggles between emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that obscures the deficit, elections and a new government is coming.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the start of the year and to allow the euro's member country not to meet its obligations.
But what makes sense is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to transparency and to engage its own citizens with shared responsibility in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves before the period of normalisation of the premium from the temporary risk, after some excesses in supported positions would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as much as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If the European disparities decrease and ours continue to expand, this would be a typical Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the studio services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 scenario of rise, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not give much hope of living to meet this warning for the Spanish economy.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "careful, my friend drivers".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday before the House of Commons, where Spain's energy strategy will be discussed in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few remarks regarding the proposal, which he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60,000 million from that date by 2030 if nuclear power plants that are currently in operation are preserved.
If this did not happen, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that investment must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections over the next decade
From 2020 onwards, the question will change and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas plants and coal-fired power plants with mechanisms for carbon capture and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supportive energies."
Galán, who believes that the draft law on a sustainable economy just passed by the government corresponds to the line the enterprise has demanded, not wanting to let go of the vein as a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, the "clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "exact" measures, as President Iberdrola has called them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken now because their ripening lasts and a stable tax framework is needed to launch them.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' by Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary Ferrovial for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of a preferential partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet resulted in economic deadlines, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castilie-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a cooperation protocol to establish a Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% is Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to research energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Aciona is pursuing its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Actiona is fighting for its first concession on the highway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water business.
The construction, which is concerned, is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5-kilometer-long tunnel in Brisbane, Australia, on the east coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in that country as a construction and concession highway business.
The town hall wishes to have the tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to initials in English) for the further development of the project in a business plan under the auspicious Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of construction and operation of tolls.
Offers are expected to be submitted in the month of May, and the projected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars(1.047 million euros) and in the last phase of the competitions three concerns with a significant presence in European construction sites.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
The Northern Direct Group is in the game against the Actiona Group with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which has passed through the sieve, is called LBRJV and is involved in the Australian capital of Leighton (a subsidiary of the construction company of the construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), also local Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a major company specializing in civil constructions Razel.
Australia's infrastructure market promises large-scale construction and privatisations, but carries with it a clear difficulty of entering in a way other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy, which was followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector in addition to Asian references.
ACS has acquired a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the cited company Leighton.
Million-dollar assets
Acciona is betting on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of businesses that build and manage a desalination facility in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The underground toll road, which promotes the Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority, called Northern Link, is supposed to connect the western highway from Toowong with a roundabout route in Kelvin Grove (see map) of 5 kilometres of tunnel length. It is the biggest event to reduce Brisbane's traffic congestion.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to be commissioned for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid transit would open in the last months of 2014, full completion of the works is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
Queensland's government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia still brings significant profits to Hochtief as it announced yesterday a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The ACS will put the national broadband network with fiber optic cable into operation through its local Leighton branch.
This situation will allow for quick internet access to 400,000 people and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the project to build a 27-story King George tower in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work was yet to begin, and Hochtief closed sales for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
The FCC was allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine branch, has been awarded the allocation of a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia worth 64.5 million euros.
The company won the contract a few days after the work was carried out to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore gets commercial in Renfe
Renfe has assigned advertising and marketing services to Sra for the past two years. Rushmore for an approximate amount of three million euros a year, the railway company reported.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented themselves in the audition for Renfe, of which four advanced to the final, among them TBWA, which was responsible for creating advertising for the past three years.
From this moment on, she will be Sra. Rushmore to take care of designing and producing campaigns.
A fine of 63 million for France Télécom for hampering competition
The regulatory authority for competition in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros lFrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to the institution, the operator has restricted competition from fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has imposed more than 560 million euros of fines since 1994 for laying down obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the authority overseeing the competition believes that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a relapse.
App Store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an app store on the internet to boost revenue that will not come from voice streams.
From the start, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million Madrid and Barçe since the beginning
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the point where Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth-highest earning club in the competition.
The list is kept by Manchester United.
The list is kept by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not just a glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
To the extent that the competition has distributed 5.362.5 million euros among 105 teams (of which 12 were Spanish) who have participated in this event since the tournament was formed in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money it earned for participating, and the only one along with AC Milan to win the top prize three times.
The Catalan current champion and the last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern in Munich, two teams that have also charged the most money for participating in the previous Champions League.
And that's despite losing both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country to receive the most money through Champions, despite winning the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex process of dividing money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to make 1.0.90 million for the Champions League.
Of that money, UEFA donates 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the preliminary classification round (among other things Atlético Madrid) got 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have achieved participation have received 3.8 million only for their presence, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each match they participate in.
There is also a prize premium (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 for each squad). Eight-finalists get three million each; eight quarter-finalists3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get 4 million.
The champion earns 9 million, while the second finalist makes 5.2 million.
In this way, the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, however, there are floating payments for which 337.8 million are intended.
This money is divided according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spain is one of the main ones and has four places.
The champion from last year will get 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
Nueva Rumasa's group yesterday released details of the offer of buying shares, with the help of which it wants to gain a top spot between 25% to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest for that deferment of 1% a year.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa's offer rates the company 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day period for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the share.
CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though Ruiz Mateos's business had confirmed it had teamed up with the regulator.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Sos, meanwhile, is further changing the structure of his leadership.
As an attempt to remain on the margins of possible offers to buy and settle the court fluctuations of his former leaders, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the election of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to take a high position in a food business.
It is a newly created place that will be subject directly to the president of the group.
And it is not exempt from the controversy as the business continues to be immersed in a legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers' companies.
The possibility that Sos will reveal new transfers of funds in the coming months cannot be shredded
As for the credit of the Salazars, the former members of the council of Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified in the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV permits option to exclude Paternina, which was attended by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorised the exclusions in which Inversora Mer is taking part, against Federico Paternin9. October.
The Supervisory Authority explained that it authorises this operation because it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and considers that the "sufficient" content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the modifications introduced on 2 December is.
CNMV specified that the offer is directed to acquire550.008 shares of Federica Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5.592.778 million shares were immobilized, which will not be able to be transferred in any way until the offer was concluded, which specified that the price was determined by Federico Paternina under the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for car valuation
These days, storms and accidents earn not only car repair shops.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insured event are towed to a service where an expert has to estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance claim is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and time of the workforce can be long and complex work.
Calculating manually the cost of repairs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and workforce can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this kind of system.
Service and insurance estimation and maintenance solutions are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solera is a leading company; 80% of the evaluations are carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation tools and producing sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, sales director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data for processing continues to grow, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
Once a new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
It is a very feverish work, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, "smart" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "poke" the individual parts of tourist cars.
When it comes to a model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
When it comes to a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but for example not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
On the mobile park in circulation exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documenting and drafting databases, Audatex has eight centers divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national residence is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) work together with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data are included each month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense stream of information allows businesses to make different uses and deliver different products.
The most common use is focused on repair and maintenance, but by country there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only undertaking at its disposal a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States, yes.
Considering the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get the support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This business offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard insurance valuation solution designed for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is paid according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
After that, each insurance company that makes thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the full identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, based only on the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to discard vehicles with a total insurance claim.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying the tendency, performing geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many modelsoftly brand have been serviced due to a crash or how many have suffered serious insurance claims over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for connoisseurs, as well as providing digital images, access to works or prices, and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group established in 1971 as a service provider and solution for damage assessment, accidents or car maintenance
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover volume increased by 20% a year over the last three years and charged 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization began with the installation of an office in Paris.
The Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its brother is formed in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, including 3,000 in Spain.
The world invoicing of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach US$557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera stood at $1,000 million on the stock exchange, and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2.400 million.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera Groups bought Autoonline, an internet base for selling cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation projected the subscription of 59.5 million euros from the company's 85% capital, which could expand next year to include the remaining 15%.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is exclusively guaranteed to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, spare parts sales and professional dealers who must register before the start of operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily adverts, and about 100 new adverts are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been decommissioned cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Historical vehicles may have traffic permitted, although they were decommissioned, after preliminary driving.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller, Audatex guarantees that the user only gets a budget in four steps: vehicle identification, spare part search, budget and budget generation
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the belief of older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent are restrained in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourist vehicles, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally for use, you need a computer with an internet connection.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphical display of the model appears and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the workforce, surcharges or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include a workforce estimate.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros a year, which the customer can finance.
Currently, Audatex is working to make these views three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome because, for example, it will allow you to select a door and turn it to show the inside.
