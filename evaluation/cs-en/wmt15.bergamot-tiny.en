Petr Cech: Last minute transfer?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
Another chance comes in the winter.
Petr Cech, currently a replacement goalkeeper of Chelsea, is now not sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the NH Hotel in Smíchov, talks to Czech journalists and is preparing with the Czech national team for a game rehearsal with the Americans and subsequently also for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualifier against the Netherlands.
In the Chelsea goal, Thibaut Courtois takes precedence in the new Premier League season, while Cech has been in a substitute position at the London club for the first time in a decade.
Some time ago, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup in matches with Atletico at the start of the season and did not even manage to enter the league season, losing 2:4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the Paris SG's interest.
He stood for the season of the French league with two wins and two draws, on Sunday he shot St. Etienne 5:0.
Relatively the shoe is pushing the club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and over the weekend he broke up with Lille amicably 1:1.
On the tabloid English websites, news jumped today that they might want a Czech in Queens Park Rangers.
According to the English bookmakers, however, Cech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet has announced odds of 4:1.
Peter, is it possible that you will change the jersey in the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never a hundred percent in football.
Maybe during the day there will be an offer that cannot be refused.
What would such an offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know yet what an offer that can't be rejected, actually looks like.
There would have to be a consensus of all parties First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's attitude, whether the club would handle the possible offer or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer when you are now in Prague?
Wouldn’t you need to sign a new contract somewhere in the new location?
I didn't think about it that.
But there are a lot of players in such a situation today, everyone is somewhere at the national team meetings and I'm sure a lot of transfers will close today.
So somehow it would be realmable.
How many clubs are there on the planet that can afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you don't push for a departure?
The situation when I did not catch the new season in the first three games of the new season is new for me after fifteen years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in the Chelsea goalkeeper's fight and it's up to the coach who he's going to choose what decisions he's going to make over the coming weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, the sports aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from the personal side, to which the needs of the family, of course, belong.
Is it possible that you were catching for another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never concern me.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule out anything.
I don't know the answer.

Police in Karrata arrested a twenty-year-old boy after motorcycle chase
The bike was stopped after a zone with a maximum speed of 70 km/h rushed 125 km/h and drove into the bush to escape the police.
In the morning in Karrata, the patrol traffic police tried to stop a blue motorbike at the side when they noticed that there was 125 km/h going from a gas station to Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then turned into the bushel, so that the officers lost sight of him.
The bike and the person who matched the driver's description were then spotted at a Walcott Way house in Bulgara.
Karath police have charged a twenty-year-old young man with disobeying a call to stop and caressing.
He will stand trial in Karrata on September 23.

Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill to protect the organization in the union as civil law.
"According to the way the unions work, the middle-class jobs are working," says Ellison, a Democratic senator for Minnesota, who is co-chairing the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud that, together with the pattern of occasional rights, John Lewis, I can introduce a law strengthening the position of employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal opportunities to prevent discrimination in unions, as in other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-union forces
Modify the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to join trade unions, to sue in a civil court – and to sue compensation or compensation – an initiative is correct and necessary.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by U.S. standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other petitioners put forward in the law is to reconnect the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to embrace, expand and respect labor rights.
There was a time, and millions of Americans still remember them when the country in one breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in the formation of a new Japan, included in them the language and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to gather, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to form a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly says: “The right to create associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
The arrangements that will restrict this right or seek to be damaged will be annulled. Measures to fulfil such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Human Rights Commission, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the petitioners and Roosevelt included in it a guarantee that “everyone has the right to create and enter unions in order to protect their interests.”
Americans have accepted the fundamental premise for generations that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with firms and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being invaded in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As the reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the power of the nation, but expanded it.
They have increased the standard of living of millions of people, creating a market for industry, and have led production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and we should not.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human - and extending civil rights protection to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is delayed.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have raised America and made it a real promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily blocks law that could shut down all Louisiana abortion clinics
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which lawyers say would likely shut down all five clinics performing abortions in the state.
The order enacted by the signature of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to come into force on September 1, would require doctors carrying out abortions to have the right to accept a patient in a hospital, 30 miles from the practice.
The judge's order means that doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and, in the meantime, they have to obtain this permission.
"The proposing party will be able to legally operate and, in the meantime, obtain permission," federal judge John deGravelles' order reads.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month so that the judge can issue a more permanent order concerning the law.
Activists for the rights to abortion resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that it would give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from a tricky law to deprive them of health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three of the five clinics, has sought the law’s blocking of the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applied to doctors from two clinics who were not among the plaintiffs, and also applied for this permit.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that passed similar laws, with the courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by federal judges on Friday.
Women's rights activists to abortion, along with the Association of U.S. obstetricians and gynecologists and the U.S. Medical Association, argue that the need to have this permit puts demands on doctors that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
Opponents of abortion countered that the measures aim to protect women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that the clinics would be closed because of the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said only one doctor performing abortions has permission in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing miscarriages, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear for his safety, the group said.
Louisiana authorities said in response that they would not punish doctors who are carrying out abortion while they were awaiting the pending application for the right to be processed.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in the countryside
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video of their late mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of QINR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The women's researchers followed the woman over seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
For women in rural and remote areas of the state, they were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that factors may be late diagnosis and poor treatment availability.
“The disease is best treated by gyne-on-councyclists who usually reside in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improving remote medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen the transportation service that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of the geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother, Elisha Neave of the city of Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to a HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that today's young generation of consumers reaches "the main age group of gardeners", garden centers will lose up to ten million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent housing will spend on their gardens on average 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own.
As other factors threatening the sector, which earns an estimated five billion pounds a year, citing an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as a parking area and a shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London region, where the proportion of owned homes fell from 61% to 43% over six years, the lowest household expenditure on garden products in Britain accounts for one household.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society said that housing in a sublet or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the main garden consultant for RHS, said: "It is very popular for tenants to grow plants in pots - when they move, they can take plants with them."
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
Also for this year, he predicted higher sales due to better weather, which came after unfavorable conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin, at the reunion of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of the Hitler Youth, he scramped atomic weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that his views were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have such a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of a fascist state.
The great peoples have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both tense nationalism and the fact that the complex of inferiority can be transformed into imperialist appetites.
Time is different in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of the wars of domination over Europe is long gone, in the east it thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and it is necessary to win back its international position.
Such mood and frustration ruled in Germany in the 1930s, just before the seizure of power by the Nazis, followed by an explosion of nationalism dissimilar to the current situation in Russia.
And then the completely identical cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the liquidation of inconvenient political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, is therefore quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russians, are probably homesick after the time when Russia ruled half the world and the second part trembled in front of them.
Perhaps Western politicians caused it themselves, perhaps little Vladimir was patting on the shoulders, maybe they did not invite him where he wanted and maybe they began to underestimate him and he simply behaved like a typical Russian muzhik.
He made his time in order, pretending he didn't even want to go anywhere and grind knives at home.
Now he's decided to retake the lost positions.
He starts slowly, he has time.
The leader is probably for life, so where he would hurry.
He trampled the Caucasus, now he is trampling on the Ukrainians, then it is the number of dwarves from the Baltics.
They've been stinging the Russian bear in the fur coat for a long time.
This will surely be noticed by China, which is somehow jumping too much and is certainly taking a crush on the far east.
And the Germans also annoy the Vladimira how well they are and we put it on their ass at 45.
How about making one new Neorossiya in Karlovy Vary.
It would be a base and there are a lot of ours and how they oppress them and the dača already wanted to demolish some of them.
After all, our veterans will remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he's so soft, he can peel like an onion and I eat their entire EU.
That would play that way to jump on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded of where their place is.
And as detonators, we will use our fellow countrymen who live in their territory.
There are enough Russians everywhere and when they say they are oppressed there, they just oppress them there and we don't let it, we'll protect them.
And again, the Russian will rule, for what else is he born to do.
After all, Europe is only good as a preposition that proud Ivan can dance to a Cossack.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over spy report
The Turkish foreign minister called the country's highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain the news of U.S. and British spying activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that according to documents provided by the former U.S. National Security Agency analyst, Turkey was the priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the news, saying that all major states are watching each other.
An older report, according to which the German intelligence service also targeted Ankara, provoked a more indignant reaction with the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones series unveils more threes of the fourth season
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the Fifth Order of the cult series.

Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The complainants on Friday presented to the office of the Mallorcan state prosecutor evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the town hall in the municipality's district of Calvia.
The director of the Calvia police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after charges brought by businessman and bar owner in the infamous party district in Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into pre-trial detention after several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street in which most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf were charged with him.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs on Friday presented evidence of extortion from police officers and state officials of the town hall in the municipality of Calvia in the municipality.
Two other local police officers were arrested by Spanish state police over links to corruption charges and will be interviewed by a judge.
Spain's national daily ABC cited dissatisfied nightclub owners that favoring public officials has serious effects on their business.
"For a long time it is not about making money, it's about survival," one businessman said in court.
Don't mess with our livel.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made it to the main pages of magazines around the world after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist appeared on YouTube, who gave oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
The island authorities have since been trying to oversee drunks and rioters in the ranks of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious bare-listed alcohol tours.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the event of providing oral sex, was forced to close for a year and together with the organizers of the tour of Carnage bars to pay a fine of 55 000 euros ($73 000).
Tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including a fashion wave known as "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and thunderstorms that impacted the flight at Adelaide airport
SPRING brought an ice surprise to the south of South Australia, coming with heavy rain and fierce winds that seriously hit the Adelaide airport.
Another 5 mm of rainfall is expected to fall in the city until nine o'clock in the evening, and another 6.6 mm falls during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was presented together with a few short showers associated with the storm and gusts of wind, which began before eight o'clock in the evening and in about ten minutes brought almost 4 mm of precipitation.
After several early doses of spring came after the winter of last week, the city's temperatures fell again to just 15.8°C on Monday.
It is believed that the stormy weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 19:30, but it was hit by a change in the speed or direction of the wind and was forced to postpone the landing.
The gusts of wind at the Adelaide airport at that time reached a speed of around 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to refraund from the second landing and eventually landed at about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently caused delays in further flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to the forecast, temperatures in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-bomb shelters, while during the fifty-day war between Israel and Hamas, rockets and mortars attacked their homes. But schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory is reeling from fighting.
The beginning of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in the south of Israel marked by the attacks, but the signs of fighting are still noticeable.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the nursery staff hit by a rocket have removed the remains of the shraps from the wall and are slowly expecting the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a resident of the Saad kibbutz and an English teacher at a local school.
A lot of children in this area really need to go back to their daily routine.
Her eleven-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that “it’s a bit strange” to go to school all of a sudden.
"We had some difficult moments and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, located near the border with Gaza, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
As long as the ceasefire did not end the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and traveled to safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village close to the border with Gaza, in which a missile from a Palestinian mortar killed a four-year-old boy, hesitates to return.
The education minister said about twelve families still did not return.
Their children were temporarily placed in surrogate schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was heavily affected by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, adding: "We will provide you with education and safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed on unlimited peace for the past Tuesday.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not solve key issues as a demand by Hamas to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of the two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, even though they do not have clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other militants from Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar missiles during the fighting on Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli military has carried out more than 5 000 air raids and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people have hid in a hundred UN schools that have been transformed into a temporary shelter.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still staying in shelters and due to ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open so that we can complete our education as well as the Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a thirteen-year-old boy from a school in Gaza's largest city.
Willing at the reunion: I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafatu suffers from temperature
The Czech national football team met today before noon in Prague before Wednesday's preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualifier against the Netherlands.
Of the twenty-three-member cadre, Spartan striker David Lafata, who suffers from the temperature, is in trouble.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players and David probably still has a little bit of problems.
But we want him to be here and be fine as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether it's two or three days, or if tomorrow it's going to be fit, that's going to be seen by his state of health, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some pain, but it's not that they can't train or participate in the match on Wednesday with the USA," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called up as the last player of the Spartan midfielder Lukáš Vácha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, and other midfielders were also considered.
I decided on the basis that Lukáš is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand by it," Vrba said to Vácha.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens to Latata
It is not impossible that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
At the weekend, for example, the Liberec Josef Šural, who gave a hat-trick, flashed with a great performance.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
Let's see how David Lafata is doing.
If he/she cannot be available on Wednesday, I am not saying that I cannot dominate any of the players who have been interested in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon, the team will have a training session in Strahov, on Tuesday, a classic pre-match training before the duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and will be followed by an autograph session.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team will be aiming for a premier victory under Vrba.
He made two draws in the previous three preparatory matches and lost once.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for 9 September from 20:45.
Pešice goes to the Dutch to Italy
Vrba is glad that, unlike previous meetings, he has more time for training.
It's an advantage when you have a player for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we haven't had that much time before.
Now we will only be able to focus on preparing for the Netherlands as best as possible," Vrba praised.
The Dutch will perform in Italy before the match in Prague on Thursday and the duel will be personally watched by the former interim national team coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that's from the match.
But it won't just be about him, we'll have a game and we're going to have a shot and we'll discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what the changes will be there," Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent world championships.
According to highly surveyed statistics, the prices of apartments in the winter period have risen the most in the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter month since 2007.
The annual price increase climbed to 10.9%, more than double in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are running at the market.
RP Data figures show that Sydney housing prices rose 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price increases on average between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was damaged by a state-stricken expenditure cut and where prices rose only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that when spring has now begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
"Given the persistent high rate of auction sell-offs, generally high sales speeds and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase even further over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
He and his father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked at the factory, had a cooler relationship.
Henry tries the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through a "tough" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You've never seen his face, you've heard his voice, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch a cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, were already adults - went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of the stroke in the cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Recently, Henry visited a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at his father's time, he looked into what life had to be for him.
There's a little more light in there today, but it's still a dark, smoky, grim labyrinth where the flames go off and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always climbed into the bath and just lay there, then he could hear him slowly starting to sing for himself, because he was washing off the foundry.
When I was passing by, I realized that he was doing this years to feed the family, and I began to respect him more.
Yet Henry lived a childhood without parental love.
No one hugged anyone, he didn't say "I love you."
It wasn't until my mom was sick and dying, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop with the “I love you”?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
With French, with whom he was married for 25 years, they are still good friends.
Dawn is good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes were beginning to show, the doctor told me, “You have to make a radical change.”
So I started going to a big fitness center and I also had to follow a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tedious.
No one wants to eat carrots.
The change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his sleek, short-haired brat.
After receiving recognition from critics for his Othello, he plunged into the theater.
This was followed by a Comedy full of errors and the Fences of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that filled out his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
The DJ noticed him on stage parodying someone and wrote about him in the New Faces talent competition.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “For a long time I was the only black impersonator/comic on TV.”
He was learning on the move.
In addition to the fact that the public must have noticed me, I also had to learn how to invent working jokes, be a star and appear on television and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which the actors dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed with his comedy for five years.
My family was already uneasy about it.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I was working on big scenes and learning how to work with the crowd.
What was “years and years-award-winning major product of British television” was also a “grotesque parody of blacks.”
In the 80's, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who at the same time ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984 and in the 1990s he was known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
For the next decade, he had been interested in commercials, documentaries, TV series and roles in movies, but after the broadcast of his series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: "So what are you going to do now, Len, because it looks a little like you've got stuck in one place, or you're missing a little bit out of your way."
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn it at school, and I thought it was something for a white middle class.
So I was scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, “You should try.”
Don't get into it when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave twenty lines from Othello's closing speech for the documentary, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me courage.
"That's what it's about. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the rehearsal was tough and I read the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which didn't happen.
He soon began playing in a Comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre. I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, “You’ve changed.”
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for the confiscation of the audience.
“The voice in my head said to me, ‘By the time he fixes the computer, you must entertain them for ten minutes.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem is resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, “Oh, thank God.”
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Fences was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like God's sign saying, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he says it in a sound vocal voice.
So I'm staying there.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the test room.
Henry still remains the brain of the comedian - he interrupts our conversation all the time with humorous performances, when he enters and emerges from the role of an imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
When you're always looking for something, you can get into the dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't feel like I used to.
I asked if he would ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in one room with a director who helps give outs to the outlines, the means and the end of the way - I don't think I ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent employees
Kenya began with the biometric registration of all its state officials to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to the government's statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will stop receiving payouts.
The government believes thousands of people are receiving a salary even after they have left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in state administration.
An audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars (£700 000) per month on the payouts of non-existent employees and further abuse of official authority.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be placed in bank accounts even after the death of an employee or after an employee leaves the state administration, said a BBC reporter from the capital, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All civil servants must come to identification centers within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government's statement said.
He also says that anyone who fails without sufficient apology will be removed from the payroll.
“By determination of the actual public service employees, this measure will significantly contribute to its cost-making and will also be used to purify the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested over 'conspiracy' against government
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of "a conspiracy against the government".
The police authority has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, fourteen high-ranking officials were among the detainees.
Some of them were involved in a December corruption investigation that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organising a criminal gang and telephone eavesdropping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at that time the prime minister) called their actions part of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen's actions against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told reporters present that not all schools had reopened, but that it was decided to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools have a traditional ceremony to be held on September 1.
Not in the whole of Ukraine is peace.
We must fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Yatsenyuk's daughter, has spoken in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
On the first day of school, it is traditionally celebrated in such a way that children wear embroidered shirts, bring balloons and give teachers flowers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the head of hard times
It carries with you a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience on the front lines.
She began her career at the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombatier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years. She resigned when her younger colleague took the highest position in the parent company Pearson's.
It is said that her severance was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, a former director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise at Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the job of the director as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and intricate entity at the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Corporations turn in two directions: inwards on the top layer of the BBC’s own leadership hierarchy, but also out on the voice of the public in times of unease when things don’t work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for a thorough reform.
But which director would risk coming into a company as a Chinese dynasty, decompose it and thus depriving itself of a job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't that hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrinking - its power, its finances - and how its status is revised.
As the circle of competition and the new technology are questioning old certainties, the immediate negotiations on licence fees are in great danger to the BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in something that is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households and each costs only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the BBC's popularity is clearly rising: 53% of supporters versus 31% a decade ago.
Models of using the BBC services have changed: Today, I see the headlines on my mobile phone, and I can watch iPlayer on the shows I missed.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and amazing institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas governor Perry says he didn't approve offensive tweet
The tweet from Texas Gov. Rick Perry's official Twitter account, which was posted on Sunday, included an offensive image by a Democratic prosecutor who initiated Perry's criminal charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another one was posted on Perry's account, which was distanced from the previous one.
A tweet that was not authorized left off my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and I downloaded it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't reply to messages with questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it's unclear who's actually responsible for his administration.
A previous tweet posted an unflattering, humorous image of state prosecutor Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry rejected the payment of funds for her office, which brought Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 election this month before a grand jury in Austin.
The postmark said: “I don’t always drive with blood alcohol levels three times higher than the limit allowed... but if I do, I sue Governor Perry for calling me to account.”
I'm the drunken Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not led by Lehmberg's office.
He was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found to be innocent and called the accusation a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked a judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because the use of the laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unintended.
Perry suspended the $7.5 million payment from the state-of-warning fund for the state's public interest advocacy, which is headquartered in Travis County, and is prosecuting corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection was prompted by a formal complaint by a left-leaning group of civic activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in his party's 2012 presidential campaign in Iowa, Perry responded to speculation that he could quit, tweeting his own photo running near the lake, and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says housing market is back 'to normal'
One of London's most prominent development companies has warned that the housing market in south-east England has "turned" to a normal level of activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread concerns about the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the development company for demanding clients Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the start of the current budget year, the market has returned from the top point in 2013 to a normal level of transactions.”
London's housing market was doing well during the decline as buyers from abroad flooded into the capital.
According to data from the cadastral office, prices in the city rose by 18.5% last year, far ahead of the average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
Berkeley’s average private, affordable and student housing prices rose by about a fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening pound, London real estate is not so attractive for foreign buyers of London property in recent months - some of them have also intimidated the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "similar tax" that politicians came up with before parliamentary elections next May.
Last week, London real estate agency Foxtons warned that the April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for borrowing, will also slow the market growth rate on real estate and price sales during the second half of the year.
New Bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in the amount of mortgages approved for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has lowered its 2020 price forecast for 2015 to 3% on the basis that prices of houses have already started to fall.
The volume of transactions, meanwhile, has fallen by a quarter in London's most expensive neighborhoods such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington each year, according to the real estate agency WA Ellis.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley as it raised cash for forward sales to more than £2.2bn.
Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same, and thanks to that, forward sales were maintained."
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the 2007 crisis.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to £380 million, yields by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the annual meeting, Piggley said it was predicted that Berkeley's annual returns would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be £450m.
Berkeley's shares stopped at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Hacker posted photos of nude Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence leaked to the internet for a hacker who claimed to have a "list of" photos of hundreds of other novice actresses.
A spokesman for the movie stars "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrenco's photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for "manifest privacy violations."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker photos, originally posted on a 4chan image sharing server, reportedly obtained thanks to a gap in Apple's iCloud Internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims, according to BuzzFeed, includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
“I hope those of you who are looking at the photos that my husband and I took in the privacy of home are happy with each other,” Winstead tweeted.
Victoria Justice, known from the cable TV series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious" has denied that the photos were genuine. She tweeted: "These alleged nude photos are the SLIP, the people."
Better to cut it off even in a blemish. *deliberate pun*.
Buzzfeed said on Sunday night that a spokesperson for the pop star Ariana Grande had denied that the alleged photos were genuine.
An extraordinary example from Howard Jacobson's lauded new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, they gradually decomposed like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time a woman told him that he was too serious, complex, violent, isolated, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He humiliatedly admitted it.
He could sting, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of his ability was an incipient love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him of the solitary bore of his life and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and a fizzle heart from a village on a northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
To the south, she came with an elderly companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited property in a damp but magnificent valley called, conveniently, the Valley of Paradise.
No one lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the slugs slimily signed on the windows, as if they thought they owned the place, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds were reminiscent of huge heads of cab.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, terrifying and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Profile of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
A shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass and holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, embarrassingly tuning the public station, which the county supplied with consoly music and soothing news, when in this the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black comedian, whom his father liked to listen to with his blinds.
You have too big legs.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They were not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - they just didn't play.
They helped them get into the desuetude, as well as the very word desuetudo.
Folk tastes have done what would never be outlawed by regulations and status, and just as people in terms of books choose memoirs in which the poor man becomes rich, cookbooks and love novels, so in music the ballads are chosen.
Kavern allowed himself to be swept away day and began to play the imaginary piano and sang in a coarse, comical voice to Aillina's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before he came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a little one.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
When you didn’t put two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't very funny back then, and it wasn't funny even now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn has never heard one.
Neither did jazz, even though it was outlawed, they didn't play.
Improvisation has gone out of fashion.
There was room in life for one “if” only.
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she would end up.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability went to people's nerves.
Jazz was humor expressed in song.
Although he had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten years old, Kevern knew the jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when the favorite singers weren't black.
No laws or pressure.
A loose society is one in which each part of it with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who were accidentally spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent with temperament and constitution suited for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent, as if nature-gifted for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family would be without a functioning phone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed washed the dishes.
Those of the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the land, while what happened happened, IF IT HAD BELOged - they were afraid of accusing them of putting them in the fire, in fact, they were afraid that the fire would spend the next time - they opened a restaurant where the labne was sold and smoked hookahs, they did not draw attention to themselves, and the inaction slowly.
To each one according to his talent.
Since she only listened to ballads, Ailinn had a hard time understanding how the dirty words Kavern had just sung would have made.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really rude," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
Not a word could escape from behind the soundproofed leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to get two mouths back in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"He seemed funny," he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief and overshackled Kever's view.
There was nothing to see in the whole wide world but the tangent of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said dubiously.
But that still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too many legs?
He looked again.
The feet don't exactly.
Maybe a little ankles...
You say you hate me because I have too fat ankles?
- I hate?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have told her, “I love you,” but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are just attracting me," he tried.
I'm kind of creepy.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel intentionally.
Maybe he was a deliberately cruel Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons flushed and got off the couch, knocking down the radio and spilling the unfinished wine.
Elder wine, so it wasn't the drink.
She seemed to tremble in her agitation like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm twisted at the fact that you're a jerk," she said...
Except it doesn't attract me.
He felt sorry for her sake, both because of her unsaking words and for the fear she had in her eyes the moment she stood up against him.
Did she think she was going to be blown?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he had no doubt that the foundations were the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean was splung.
The same deranged men, after WHICH HAS SEEMED, even more subtle and arduous than their ancestors, smugglers and spoiled, wandered angrily from the pub to the pub, ready to lay a hand at any woman who dares to reject them or laugh at them.
A jerk?
If she doesn't be careful, they'll show her fists!
First to cuddle her - cuddling became the most common term for erotic stimulation between a man and a woman: the antibody of the dull ballads about the love that the radio spewed - first they anointed it, then grumble it.
In Kevern's view, excessive refinement, because cuddling itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons neverlessly implicited him to leave.
He got up from the couch as an old man.
She felt annoyed herself, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched as he walked away - as if she were watching him from the upstairs window - the man she had caught up with what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart tightened for him and for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them beat her up.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders down, ashamed, his loser, all the belligerence left him - why did she feel like she knew this look well, even though she couldn't recall a single moment until today that she would ever see it?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic thirty-two-year-old researcher working in Onnow, the non-statutory monitoring system of Public Mood, prepared a brief article about the persistence of light and moderate violent acts in the areas of the country where its mitigation or directly stops were most expected if enough money and energy were spent on its elimination.
“A lot has been done, and a lot has yet to be done,” she wrote, “to calm the innate aggression of people who have fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the well-founded, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the tips of the church towers, which, despite the tips of the church towers above the hedges, the touch of human kindness has rarely appeared.”
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It would seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour unfortunate stories, claiming that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas the old brutality holds as stubbornly as in urban agglomerations, but also evidence shows that at home, in the workplace, roads, and even on sports fields, new and offensive intolerance appears.
"Unfortunately, you tend to too flowery," her supervisor said.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an ate player?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme reapply to her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I'm not asking that way," Rabinowitz said, "that I'd have something against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
We don't have prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unbiased societies.
But a kind of hypersensitivity that is completely acceptable and commendable in itself can sometimes distort judgment as you did.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the Church - the things you call "cruel" and "brutal" others could also interpret as an expression of natural strength and energy.
Keep dealing with WHAT HAD happened, if IT HAD Happened, as if it had happened, yesterday, preparing a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head, on the light board, the recommendations that Onnow had been broadcast to the world of the last quarter of a century or more flashed on his head.
Smile at the neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, converse, explain, agree, apologize.
To speak is better than to keep quiet, the word sung is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I totally understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum said softly as she was sure her supervisor was over, "and I'm no longer saying that the wound didn't heal as we tell ourselves that it's healed.
My fear, first of all, is that if we are not warned about it in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened IF IT HAD BEEN.
This time, however, we will not vent anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz combined his fingertips.
This was meant to mean infinite patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when the steps they may have taken and may not have been done by your grandparents, you describe as mistakes.
Too far away, you also look at talking about venting your “ertise” and “distrust” of “others.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in the understanding of the past and in the protection of the present, we are not talking about “us” and “s” in the understanding of the past and in the protection of the present.
There was no “we” and there were no “yours.”
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"During which, if we are honest with each other," Esme gathered courage, "we are no blameless.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not what happened, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add to that - we agree on this.
And just as there is no fault that can be blamed on someone, there are not even things that should be rectified, even if the remedy was appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past for, but to learn from it -
The past exists to be forgotten.
If there's anything I can add to it -
Luther Rabinowitz unbuttoned his fingertips.
"I'll take your message into account," he said, and released it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the pavement in a way that passers-by described as "brutal and furious."
Coincidences are happening.
Lesotho Kingdom Army Says It's Not Planning a Coup - Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied organising a coup to overthrow the government, claiming they were acting against the police suspected of orchestrating political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the military has encircled its official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maser.
After declaring that he was threatened with death, the prime minister and his family went to neighboring South Africa.
An army spokesman, Major Ntlele Ntoi, said it was not in fact a coup, but an army response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm themselves.
"This morning, the command of the Defense Forces of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several reports from the information service that there are several groups in the ranks of the police that plan to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to make havoc in the country," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
“While no one has declared that he has seized government power with the help of force, the actions of the lesot defense forces are bearing signs of a coup d’etat,” he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he was the target of an attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended the session of parliament due to internal disputes, there have been tensions in Lesotho.
He said that despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine his actions to the government.
Production in the euro area is at a thirteen-month low
Production growth has slowed to a thirteen-month low in the euro area in August, according to a closely watched survey.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) from 51.8 in June fell to 50.7 in August.
A number higher than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have declined, and factories have damaged rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the eurozone’s delayed recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he was considering quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to the UK and the US have taken during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty for producers is becoming increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
Germany's manufacturing PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is a concern about France, Italy has gone from expansion that stagnation.
Signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared is also not very calming," Dobson said.
The slowdown of the industry is likely to bring oil into the fire to analysts expecting further monetary or tax stimulus.
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing that can be said about the purchasing managers' manufacturing overview for August is that it shows that the sector continues to grow."
He added: Eurozone producers are currently very complex to live, as increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - are adding even more uncertainty to the ever-demanding conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has been demonstrably affected by trade - and especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even canceled, especially the costly ones.
He said that it appears to be “even more likely” that the ECB will eventually have to make some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten Years of Bakers of Beslan Survivors: Ten Years From the Horrors of Occupied School, Children Still Suffer
Ten years ago, a thousand people were detained as hostages at a school in Beslan in southern Russia hostage
During the ordeal that lasted three days and shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children
We returned to Beslan to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocity at school
Exactly a decade after the horrifying occupation of a school in Beslan, killing 334 people including 186 children, the surviving heroes warned last night against the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance over the tragedy united the east and the West, which in this catastrophic misfortune led to action and the future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to seek some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at the school.
We found amazing young people who resisted the misfortune, even though the memory of the hell caused by the terrorists will live in them.
What is their greatest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like they were dying - is over.
Girl trying to crawl back into ruined school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as only in her underwear she tries to get back into the bombed-out school gym after a bomb exploded in it.
The confused Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larisa, who is now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but in fact they survived.
"Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were bloody.
I got up and got back to find my mother.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another surgery.
I had splinters left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as doctors help her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said determinedly.
"It just happened to me and that can't be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate from Jer Gapa's class was killed there.
As little ones, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t have to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten the captivity, but memories are fading a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we got from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo on the Internet, how I climb through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the catastrophe and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, the school kids start at the age of seven) and survived a three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, “My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, “Okay.”
He was afraid she was dead, running away, and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbing the baby's hand and running away with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was deceiving herself and lying in hospital with her injured leg, and she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, proclaimed the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that memories are fading.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my guns to play.
Today, however, I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I have no problem with it.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the court and who didn't get out.
We'll never say they've been killed or that they've died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy store and how I went through a convertible.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where he and his friends suffer as much because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
“I’m terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such horror,” says Damir, who took part in volunteering at the monastery last week.
I want so much to help.
One day I want to work in the police and hope to take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says, "They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack. There were no children who screamed and run here, and the silence took months.
He vividly remembers the journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir fancy borscht, so they called all Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with waiters in the restaurant, Damir shot at them from a water gun and they ran and played with him.
And that was only a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said, "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in those ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been and will still be killed.
They're the same children as ours.
I think for a lot of people war is just something in the news that they hear when they get bored or doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror they are.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to murder each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown up and is a nice and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates, and from time to time he goes to the gym and light candles.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lying on the couch with his face facing away from us, and sometimes he lay like that for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember throwing all his guns or other weapons to play. Damir is 17 today, he's taller than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was sure for a few hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got up to my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, and there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was pretty sure my little boy didn't have this hell stand a chance to survive.
“I remember screaming ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So, unlike others, our lives go further.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photograph taken after the attack became a symbol of horrors in Beslan
Convection: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack on the right of Grigory
As he ran for his life after the Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, there was a blazing fear in his bloodied face.
His photo was one of the most shocking atrocities in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed into the yard, so my little boy stayed there for three days alone," she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's getting harder to think about it and talk about it.
Not a single day will pass, so that we do not remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: A photo of Grigorije (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigorij was really looking forward to school that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of a weeping Grigoriy in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at the photo and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I get it, but I also think that thanks to that picture, people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says, “The important thing is that this doesn’t happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
Such tragedies are still under investigation, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they are investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what was the cause?
This world is waiting for something too bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget, he needs decades.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
When I got back to school in 2004, every day I was scared.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who killed.
When it comes to September 1, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel remorse.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderous terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"We feel like it's yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent, but he could not because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
Now I'm older and they say that kids can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say it's not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the year after - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'm never going there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in hospital after attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful of my knee, which I hurt, but I'm walking normally.
But even so, because of my health, I couldn't get in and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was impossible.
My next hobby is the animals, so I went to the vet.
I finished there the second year.
They learn how to treat all animals from “cats to cows”.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my children about this.
It's not something that children should know about, and certainly not something they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain will be here all the time.
It's inside and getting worse with the anniversary approaching.
I will attend commemoration ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because unlike me, he was there.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he gave it back to me. Here in Bessano, there are traces everywhere.
It stays with us.
Gregory is an adult today, but he keeps the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terrearn is that unfair to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He has undergone several surgeries, he can walk, but he can not exercise.
I would say that about 50% has already overcome the terror, but it is impossible to overcome it completely and forget.
This terrible experience with us will always be.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and it only makes the pain worse.
I've lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but I'm hurting the loss of the slain.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who did not revisit.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm observing what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
We've been a friendly country in the past, so how did we get to the fact that we're fighting together now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could pick up all these rebels and throw them away - as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who carried to safety a special commando
Rescued: Alyron Tskaev carries into the safe Russian special commando (left).
Now she is ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all
The world gasped in 2004 when a Russian police officer carried the little Alyon out of Beslaski's capita.
The terrorists released her, but retained her thirty-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar, in captivity in the school gymnasium.
Makhar, who had been three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and with his new wife Svetlana, they have a little girl named Kristina after the dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember the attack at all and grew up a bright and happy girl.
A close friend said, "it's a big happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories commemorating the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Man accused of knocking down a girl on a crosswalk in the village of Fife

Prosecutors say Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with sufficient lightness and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, has denied charges in a court in Dundee.
Judge Charles Macnair has set a standing date for January.
4 Tips on How to Take Better Photos and Videos Underwater
If you are interested in shooting or underwater shooting, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera like GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these photos at a family party of several cameras, all cost less than $350.
It does not matter what equipment you use, but for the best results, there are several rules.
Check the equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will be taking.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scenic or filming mode that optimizes the exposure to dark underwater environments.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only up to 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both normal and waterproof design.
Always make a few pictures - a lot of them don't work out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you with photo composition, but outdoor ones don't have it.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be poorly visible underwater and the composition of the shot will be preconcerned.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper dive of light, it is significantly declining.
If possible, stay close to the surface when taking photos in the pool, lake or sea.
It also allows you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the less color you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is excellent advice if you take pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because of the more muted light.
It is especially important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle of the lens, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesitiser, he dedicated his career to relieve the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that mapped him.
Lawson understood that while doctors are concentrating on diagnoses and diseases, treated patients overwhelmingly are interested in something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with flu symptoms and found himself impatient and his wife Juliet involves remorse.
He said, “I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.”
When Juliet left for a week's business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague gave him an X-ray of his chest.
One two weeks earlier, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came.
He had a mesothium, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what was the cause of it.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
Mezoteliom is different.
In almost all cases, the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building fibrous material that was previously referred to as "miracle", but today it is known to be deadly.
It was not difficult for most of us to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 60's, when the ban on the use of asbestos in the industry came into force.
Even at a time when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as the treasurers of isolation, builders, carpenters and workers in the shipyards.
The toxin used in the industry in another era is now difficult to see a cause for concern.
Such a suicid is not appropriate.
As it turns out, a mesothiebreaker peaks in Britain today.
The number of mesothelioma deaths here is higher than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths from the disease a year is twice as many victims of automobile accidents.
Number of mesothelioma deaths annually since 1980 and estimated deaths in the UK in the future
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999) is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not concern only veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases is still present, present in the homes in which we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in the shops in which we shop.
Mesothelioma therefore does not respect the social class, wealth, occupation, or age.
Privileged strongholds from London department stores to public schools do not represent a shelter.
Parliament, too, is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which they should treat us are the repository of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn't even lay in isolation.
He tried to find out where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It's possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same illness?
Unfortunately, this was a question that he was able to answer in part.
“Of the four doctors who were at Guy’s Hospital and who had mesotelio in the past five years,” he said in a letter in 2010, “I’m the only one still alive.”
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When 17. He died in February this year, 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis is not usual for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
Illute is always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us get the same disease?"
According to the leading British mesothelio expert Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is taking place, about 90 000 people die.
Most of them currently have no idea they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
With a cursory look at the files from the archives of the courts, to which the afflicts often turn and require compensation, shows how much the mesotheliomic disaster has spread.
For example, this June admitted to Marks & Spencer that it had exposed asbestos Janice Allen thanks to negligence.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised the clothing section in two stores - one of the places was the company's flagship, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children, who are in their 20s.
"Before it happened," he says, "I've never heard of mestelimo before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed that he might have involved me in any way.
There aren’t many people who know something about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
He was named because of his fibrous structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the construction industry.
Most often in buildings today it is possible to find chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, but the EU and the WHO consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (crocydolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say that "there is persuasive but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK]."
Marsk & Spencer employee exposed to asbestos in a flagdlound shop in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pete points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “a substantial part of mesothelioma cases without known asbestos exposure to work or at home was likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exhibition is due to the “normal use and weathering” of buildings.
No one seems to be sure they're safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even the people in the center of the government need not know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that service lifts and pipes behind the rooms of the parliamentary committee were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibers could be broken by something as harmless as the "strong airflow."
Ministers are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament's services directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster be given a "positive medical certificate", it is now expected that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed for Parliament to be thoroughly inspected, electricity will be modernized and asbestos removed, and that after the 2015 elections, MPs will sit in the premises of Queen Elizabeth II's Conference Center rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in compliance with several regulations."
It is impossible to say whether this mismatch will cost lives.
Everyone can only wait now.
One of the people who were never able to determine when they had asbestos exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos has been proven," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was overcome by something like chills.
He was 45, he was in the evening, and he was in the middle of surgery.
Suddenly I was trembling.
It came at once.
I was so bad.
I thought I wasn't going home in the car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain came from the turmo, the linings around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe that it was a mesothelioma.
He eventually spent a month at home.
The confused doctors made an X-ray of his chest and introduced him to remove the fluid they had sent for analysis from his lungs.
Still, they didn't make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after exercising and breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not associate anything with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and at work he came into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his doctor consulted his CT scans and X-rays with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lining of the lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I tend not to take much,” he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry about it very much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy results arrived between Christmas and New Year's Day: "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesotelioma
Abbott began meeting with the sisters of the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"The asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipes," he says.
In the case of people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest itself.
Mesothelioma is now beginning to concern younger people who do not have high-risk occupations.
The most dangerous pipes thermally insulated with asbestos were in the basement in hospitals, so it was unlikely to endanger patients.
However, members of the staff who crossed the basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, decades after the war, hospitals were the place where they could save patients' lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still removed today.
Pupils put Bunsen's kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just about the hospitals.
Asbestos is often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people were exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless chemistry lessons, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos pad.
A website dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools has been created.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was a single contact with asbestos, which a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember, in the 70's while destroying a garden house.
So be careful how you're breaking down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is untreatable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while for you to figure it out," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was to move from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
As a myriad of patients before him, he remembers how he felt confused about the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand,” he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How much time do I have left? '
I was told that twelve months.
I remember, “Well, I won’t live to see another Christmas.
That's the way it is.'
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive, because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesoleli are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos form small fibers.
When asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in a pleural, a lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irrit the corroe and can cause cell mutation.
“The problem is inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of needles,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mesoleli.
Treasure Lawson is known and treated other patients who were probably exposed to asbestos during his practice at the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the tissue of the lungs, Treasure says, and "respiriting itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
By its nature, it has been invasive from the very beginning.
On mesothelioma common treatment options used in other types of cancer do not work as much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is being discussed.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleifer," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer does not “not respond to chemotherapy” which, although “has some effect”, does not cure.
“Sometimes there’s someone who survives lung cancer,” says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould has died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After the meteorology was discovered, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counselor for equally disabled people.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself: "Hello, you have reached the cancer headquarters."
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would probably only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I was gonna give up.
Lawson, however, “has been able to show things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Laduski from the Thoracic Surgery Department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they checked in," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a requisition and they would have to approve the payment.
In order to get to the best available treatment, the issue of money is crucial for mesothelioma patients.
But when various treatments ultimately fail, many patients face additional financial concerns - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgana of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, it has been known that asbestos is harmful to health,” Morgan says.
In the 60’s, however, it was found that even a very small number of it could pose a health risk.
And here we meet with the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually matched, but Morgan said it wasn't a "full-fledged settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was a result of asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, Guy's Hospital spokesperson confirmed that "assistants in the incriminated basement section had been removed in the 90's."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
To blame the exposure of lethal asbestos to one company or the place of work - usually decades after this - for patients with a mesothelioma seeking compensation proved to be a huge problem.
A lot of former workplaces have changed hands or failed.
The insurance records have gone missing.
And those who are now defending themselves with the accusations have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this fact, this year an important new legislation was approved, thanks to which it is easier for mesothelioma patients to claim compensation, even if it is not possible to find their former employer.
The law has created a $350 million financial reserve paid by insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disability will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally give them as compensation - approximately 120 000 pounds.
300 successfully completed applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, thinks £350 million is “good work.”
“It’s an agreement written by insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if he hadn’t hit the time and people with a mesotheliom would be able to track down former employers and normally sue them.
Even Mike Penning, a former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had gaps."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, rapid action was necessary.
"People are suffering too much and they need help right away," Penning said in December last year during a second reading of the mesothelioma law.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Laddunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Ladunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment for which Lang-Ladunski boasts a survival rate of five years in up to 40% of patients.
Abbotta strengthened it.
"Of course, that's not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see it all the time in patients.
There is something that drives you.
When you surrender, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Check-in check-ups showed no symptoms of the disease.
I went for another check in March [2014].
I had several spots in my chest [cancer].
My 50th birthday was coming.
It doesn't endanger life.
It's taking him.
Abbott has undergone six cycles of chemotherapy again.
There are currently no traces of a tumor in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how the alarm clock on the boiler works.
When you learn the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden, a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not lightened by hope or just a hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought Stephen Jay Gould) a joyful certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “The mesotheliom doesn’t endanger life.”

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to elect leadership - protesters promise revenge
Despite the increasing discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese parliament has decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 election.
It is likely that this move will trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district as activists began to organize and prepare just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to exclude any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but it infuriated us," said lawmaker Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They lied to people in Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China's decision, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would be caused by a "chaos."
Since 1997, when Britain returned China to the Hong Kong administration, Beijing has promised that from 2017 residents will be able to vote for executive power.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong's allow direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders are holding firm the process of the committee's nomination process, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded some of the largest and most-watched protests in Hong Kong in a few years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are the Occupation of the Centre with Love and Peace, which the organizers have threatened to close the financial quarter if Beijing does not give them universal ballot.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupation movement in the rain gathered outside the headquarters of the Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that it will begin waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement "weighed the occupation of the Headquarters only as a last step in the event that all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there will be no other choice.
We must regret to announce that all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted today and the occupation of the Headquarters is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days and strengthened the protection of the government's headquarters on Sunday and deployed police and barracks.
The incitement of the unrest, according to many Hong Kong residents, is a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The insulity of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of products and services.
There are also growing fears that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupation of the Center and say their demonstrations threaten trade - the Hong Kong lifeboat.
“The protest he’s talking about could cause much more economic damage, depending on how many people they take part in and for how long,” said Regina Ip, a politician who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to expand the fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perception could harm investment.
Chinese state media has also come up with reports in recent days that portrayed by Democratic activists in Hong Kong as Western-controlled subversive agents.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which came to 780 000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
Pre-election agitation?
The League in Jihlava bears the name of the political movement
Approximately 1 600 amateur athletes play in the regional city of Vysočina.
And their top competition is newly called Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after one movement that goes to the October municipal elections.
In addition, the tenth on his candidate is the head of a small football in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem with it," Mráka said.
The situation around the first league of small football has already been dealt with by the lawyers of the Jihlava City Hall and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
According to the city’s website, Malá football received around a million crowns last year.
This year it is also in the hundreds of thousands.
In the legal opinion, the procedure of small dug is not contrary to the law or the directives of the municipality.
However, the situation is a stimulus for the Office to modify the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulis, a spokesman for the municipality.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time express as a small football support in the elections to one political party, it is probably no longer possible.
Vysočina's "big" football has not yet come up with a similar demand from politicians.
That the ČSSD would create a regional championship, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like the sponsors from the ranks of companies to contact us," commented Miroslav Vrzáček, the chairman of the regional football association.
The head of small football of another party and movement will not let the league name
According to players of small football, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own area with six playgrounds, cloakrooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, the Na Stoupy pitch is not ours, we are rented there," said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
However, there will be, for example, a nonsensical area for skaters, which is about fifty in Jihlava," Mráka pointed out.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small football uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupy, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are preparing modernization or construction of sports facilities at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think that for a little kicking has made huge progress in the last few years," Vymazal added.
Other political parties in the names of the leagues will not appear, according to Jan Mrac.
We have limitations.
If someone in one field enters into our partnership, we don’t put the other there anymore,” he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider this at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the Town Hall's Spot'.
"But let the voters evaluate whether Mr. Mráka is using the association Malá kopáná Jihlava and the city subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates into university life - freshmen can fly a jet plane
We are pleased to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to give the best possible impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also said the service has a security side.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their things across the entire state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher - very important freshman) variants this year, we will ensure that they arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that since the services had just started, they have no reservations yet, but added: "Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay a one-year tuition fee of £9,000, it expects the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and desires – it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve this.
The National Union of Students criticized the service as unaffordable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, said: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students who go to university this month must deal with the financial crisis before they throw away thousands of pounds for something as simple as coming to the dorm, because affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep pace with the cost of basic needs.
Feminists oppose racism and police behaviour after Ferguson events
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
Those present waiting for the funeral with their hands churn out, "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed young man Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez showed a shift in online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and equality of income, white feminists prefer gender to race.
With increasing tensions in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perézová noticed that the reaction of the white women was 100% focused on the race.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the shooting on August 9, personal articles with headlines such as “thought white woman over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not just about oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perezová, this represents an important change.
“I don’t think there are many people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privileges at that level,” she said.
People felt they had to comment on what happened.
It is characteristic of the crisis we face because [a situation in Ferguson] is so racially outlined that they had to draw attention to it.
According to an English professor at Ohio State University, Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson has brought to light the problems that African-Americans have to face every day and which in the cultural sphere are not perceived as “female issues.”
"I can post funny stories on Facebook from life with my partner and it gets 150 liquors from people around the world," Ms Mitchell said.
When I write something about the fact that they are colorful in their own country trapped, it is a fooling silence.
“How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no question between the issues of race and gender of dichotomy.
According to her, black women could not afford the luxury of clearly dividing these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white women today merge the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a female professor, and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10 000 blacks were lynched and the reason was the rape of a white woman in almost all cases," Hattery said.
To justify the lynching, you needed the cooperation of a white man.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and black people came when a campaigner like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19-th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote - a woman or a black.
"They have decided to wager cards on the right to vote for women and the right for black people to focus later," Hattery said.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colorful women don't believe in white people.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to begin organizing themselves against lynching in the Association of Southern Women to Prevent Rinse.
The group was formed 40 years after the black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the surge of reactions from white feminists to the questions posed in Ferguson - the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "smoke" questions that black women faced by generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these spaces [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?”
The second wave of feminists who have made careers fighting for reproductive law and access to contraception are now figuring out what it means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot, posting a column of Rebecca Carroll from the Guardian, which demanded that white Americans protest against racism more forcefully.
"I hope that women who have different but still similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and opinions about race, which differ significantly in opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem holds intersectional feminism, which includes both racial and gender issues, her comments on the question of the race in America confuse some people.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of "Who stole feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young males, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but the notes of Steinem's sides of Ferguson face criticism she has provoked before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it sparked angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied juveniles in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of reforming immigration laws arose again - this time as a female issue.
Andrea Mercad, co-chairwoman of We Bellong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that in order to present the question as necessary for women, all they had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," says Mercad.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come up with them find themselves in a position to be vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories are happy in women's organizations," she said.
The place of residence in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, it was resting on it in the living room of a pig.
The one-bedroom stand-alone house, which is for sale for £120 000, stands on a private trip in Ipswich.
The information photos included a picture of the living room, in which he rests with his head on the sofa of a pig.
Real estate agency Connells said the pig in the photo is a pet of the owners.
"The photo was there by mistake, and that's why it's already been removed," a spokesperson for the office said.
In the information about the property, the real estate agency Connells described the former prayer room as “a unique single-room house.”
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it is still appearing in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some have asked if the pig is included in the price.
After lottery win, Harvey city has fresh millionaire in the southwest
A lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
The search for a new millionaire in the southeast of Perth, one lucky person will take home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery campaign.
The newsagents in Harvey were lucky for the second time in five years, the last time it was a million-dollar win in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to apply.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the entire city in Perth's southwest of Perth is talking about the win.
It's the main theme and everyone is upset.
We thought a similar win was to the touch.
Eight winners split one win in Western Australia last month, capping several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, and just a few weeks earlier, the couple in Belmon won a whopping $7.5 million.
The winning duo had been betting for twenty years and said that the win would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the lottery in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave in the evening.
Engineers want higher wages
In a press release, GDL called the protest a warning strike for which it deliberately selected time outside the rush hour.
The chosen time of the strike takes into account many people who return by rail from the weekend only during the first working day.
At the same time, we are also thinking of people commuting for work during the day," the union said in a press statement on Monday morning to call for a strike.
"Our first strike should mainly hit freight transport, less passengers," GDL added.
DB has not yet released an official response to the announcement of the strike.
It is not even clear how the protest will affect international railway connections, including the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding an increase in driver's wages by five percent and shortening working hours by two hours a week.
Currently, the average salary of train drivers is between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (98 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year depending on the years worked.
The drivers at the DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accede to pay increases while reducing working hours.
They stress that the wages of train drivers must develop in the same way as with other railway staff, for which DB does not count towards shortening the working week.
The danger of Krestigite's car burning.
That's why he quit the Barum Rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I didn't even think something like that could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust have been provisionally repaired and continued at a slower pace to the garage, where would the mechanics replace it?
If we went straight, we would.
But there were two more stages ahead of us, and that didn't work.
There is a high temperature in it, and the risk of the car starting to burn was great.
I can't afford that.
You passed five special stages at full speed.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, and I didn't go over the vint.
Everything was caused by the fact that we had been drinking the car for more than half a year to be at some level.
The race showed we did it.
You started it so that you could have realistically thought of winning.
I prepared myself and myself in such a way that we really had to win.
The work didn't come to nothing.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of has not come.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the tops who had resigned prematurely from the fight for the first place.
It also dropped out of foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi.
Were you surprised that so many favorites have resigned?
Yes.
Especially for the spectators, it was a shame, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, to whom you are going to car, also moved at the top for a long time.
But he paid for the fact that he flew off the track and scooped almost two minutes.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame because he could have repeated the podium.
He was running the first second time.
But even Mira confirmed that we had prepared the car well.
He was going very fast.
Exactly a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good sense of driving make you a regular rally driver again?
I'm sure not at this point.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race and I still didn’t keep it.
I decided to go it again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance again in a year, I think I'll go for it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people have arrived at the track just for you.
Did you enjoy it?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, have been constantly asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team continues.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition, Honza Sýkora wants to borrow fabia from us for this race.
With Mira we have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to prepare things for next year.
Can you tell you something yet?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsican Rally was part of the World Championship, you reached your maximum in the series in fifth place.
Are you tempted to try the tracks there again?
He's not tempting.
An oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have a certificate of incapacity for work from your doctor, which serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer.
Subsequently, there was an agreement that the given days would be registered as holidays, but the agreement was only verbally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose the obligation to have the employer's consent to take leave confirmed in writing, in practice this procedure has proven itself.
If only verbal agreement occurs, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the taking of leave, as in your case, denial and absence in the work may be considered as a long-term unexcused absence, therefore a reason for the immediate termination of employment pursuant to Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a litigation about an agreement with your employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been terminated according to § 53, only you have given the given days in the credit sheet as an unexcused absence.
Unexcused absence in the credit sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to receive material security in unemployment), yet it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend you to visit the doctor again and have it confirmed in writing that there has indeed been an injury, as a result of which you were incapable of the work (this is not a so-called "disabled" only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can submit the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, as well as to the employer’s notification or requesting written consent to taking leave.
You will avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart Accident on Returning to the Track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just behind the half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway racetrack.
Stewart crashed into the barrier for the second time after his right front tire burst in 172 laps, and the race ended for him.
Stewart drove the damaged car into the garage, did not express himself to reporters and left.
The head of his team, Chad Johnston, said the team of the car no. 14 is disappointed, but will now concentrate on the race in Richmond, in Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I'd like us to have better performance and a better conclusion," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping we'll do better there.
Stewart crashed into the barrier for the first time in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairing the right side of his car.
"We've put hopes of a good finish in today's race," Johnston said, adding, "I just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York City, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up on the spot in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into a tragic accident in which a twenty-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, who drove into Stewart's journey during the race.
Authorities said it would take at least another two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
So far, it has not decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion was warmly encouraged before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the beginning of the race he worked his way up to 10. and then even on 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car no.
18 were out of control, drove out of the second corner and crashed into Stewart, sending both cars into the barrier.
Stewart continued but retreated to 21st place.
Prague has selected new taxi stand manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for new taxipoint administrators.
For 103 parking spaces, it receives approximately CZK 12.3 million per year.
Until recently, it collected 150 thousand crowns per year for the same seats for taxi drivers.
This was reported by Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used a draw in the selection of administrators.
The winner then received a lease for a flat-rate amount of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
Currently, the amount of the offer is decided.
"A year since the denunciation of the original lease agreements and the opening of tenders, it has been proven that the new leasing system is much more advantageous and generally fairer for Prague," the councillor said.
The most expensive spot is Na Perštýně
The highest price was offered by those interested in a station in Na Perštýně street.
It pays 2.1 million crowns per year.
Approximately CZK 1.5 million was paid by the new administrators for the places in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The councillors adopted the new rules of taxipoint leases in the autumn of 2012 and terminated the original lease agreements in the summer of last year.
The selection procedure was held in four waves and the new administrator found 29 habitats.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the well.
We released it all every time, creating practically the second pond around the cottage.
Then we pouring Savo in there.
Incredible stench!
Our well in the cellar always offered plenty of beautiful fragrant water.
And that wasn't professionally done, Grandpa scooped it up with self-help.
Long time ago.
She was just for three rings and overall quirky, as everything at the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we drained the water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water didn't smell.
We were wondering if anything had fallen in there.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a little bad luck, the plate there was quite no passage, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, nothing could be seen in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we let her out again and clean it up.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
A glued packet of some cubes lay on the ground.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further on.
Now it looked like a drooling mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where the vents are, Grandpa's invention, were the remains of fish!
And hard to jet!
Our basement is also peculiar.
Some would say Grandpa just underpung the cottage.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The wall and floor are only smothered sand, only the ceiling is undercut.
They mainly land there.
And the wheels.
And the sun loungers to the beach.
The door with wide gaps was usually open as someone went there in one piece.
At the ceiling several already mentioned vents.
Without a net, so there are birds normally flying and they build nests on the beams.
It is useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be luft, and it was.
But now even the luft didn't help.
The whole cellar smelled.
We also cleaned the whole cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw out the things that were around: boards, herallite record, and all.
Our cottage at a distance welcomed passers-by with a disinfectant odor.
We were wondering who could have pulled the disgusting leftovers?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It would be hard to have a snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who is not quite right.
If he didn't give us the disgusting stuff there with the air?
He's been here practically all year round, stupid ideas, he's got that.
We decided to watch the cellar and the well and regularly check.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing, before the tests are done, but it was already good.
Pulling water from the forest well is not something I want to do for a long time.
We once heard the terrible anxious barking of our bitch.
My mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Reza jumped over her and squeaked like crazy.
My mom scolded her because she thought Reza had dug the waste hose from the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose partially got into the ball and partially straightened up.
Hiss was on the balcony.
The woman showed a hysterical attack.
We ran down.
Snake, long a lot over a meter and fat like a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Reza prevented her from doing so.
It was not clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the snake saw the out Rival in the form of our whole family, she probably told herself to eat it, when we were so hungry, and gracefully stretched through the vent into the cellar.
We followed her.
Like lightning, she jumped behind the well.
By the way, we noticed another stinking package on her board.
According to the smell, probably a fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a scoundrel.
We locked the cellar during the day.
That he would...
We went out and there we each lay down to one vent.
We didn't wait long.
It was smuggled for the well.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on the neck.
Then the whole snake went up to the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to gather in.
A discarded employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
After his release, the disgraced employee bought computers for the company and then sold them.
He spent the money before the arrest of the police.
Within a short period of time, the man purchased a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"He took the laptops to Olomouc after the takeover, where he sold them after bazaars," said Rostislav Brückner, the senior commissioner of the Šumperk Police.
The motive for the fraud was revenge on the employer for the release and also the profit of money.
"In questioning, he told us that he used the money for loan repayments," Brückner said.
Police also found that the fraudster was a pathological player who was repeatedly treated in psychiatry.
The money could also end up in winning devices or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," the commissioner said.
A fraudster, who has already been punished once for theft, is now facing a prison term of one to five years.
Police have not yet said whether there is also a risk of punishment for the bazaars that bought the laptops under the price and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they took over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have been charged.
Come on, a little bit, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared several changes for us.
The biggest one was the change of the route that brought the target to the embankment instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took pictures together and filmed videos.
To perfect my gaze from the other side, I took the role of a personal conductor.
Together with my friend Katya, we obediently ranked at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends who were walking around us to the sector for faster runners.
There was not much time left.
A few jumps to warm up, turn on the sport testers, the countdown and the start!
Screaming of cheering, but instead of a quick start, there was a scrambling to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn on the measurement and run at a pace for an hour ten.
We intertwine with a yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, are running their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, the slowly descending sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad almost kitschy tinge.
The pulsating mass stretching along the waterfront looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
On the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to manifest itself, who has the power.
A light hill on Palackého Square forces many runners to slow down or cross into walking.
Just before the crossover to the Theatre, I see a police escort and Vítek Pavlišta immediately flies to the finish at an incredible pace.
I can hear the admiring sigh of other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to smash me, but just before that my leg sprains and our hands are narrowly missed.
The run of the Theatre Street gives a chance for a short rest and breath.
It is necessary, there are places in front of us where the views will take my breath away.
The turnaround on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in the beauty of the setting sun.
I don't breathe and my feet carry me almost alone.
Behind the first refreshment, there is a moment of truth.
When the road is crossed, Katya stumbles against the curb and shows off the jump in a float.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm running a series of cheering words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and we continue through the Goat Aisle, it is one of the narrowest points of the track, at this stage of the race there is no such rush, but it is still necessary to watch the surroundings well.
I have no idea that the concept of the narrowest place will gain its true meaning later.
Behind the dust gate we are frantic encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to clarify with everyone who offers a hand, and I advise Kata, because ten applauses with fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we are accelerating again and even though we have fallen quite significantly, now the pursuit has begun.
We overtake dozens of runners, when I pass someone especially tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: "Come on, a little more, you can do it!"
No one beats us to the last refresher, we accelerate.
So far we have run for an hour and a quarter, we add, there is nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish will hurt, but it is really necessary to work.
The sun has already slowly set and the end of the day symbolically slowly ends the race.
The last run on the bridge, the turn and just the straight to the finish.
The pace we run amazes me, where does it come from in the girl?
"Come on, we're going under an hour thirteen, we're working!" I call.
We try it out, we're sprinting, and there's a goal.
An hour thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can I do.
The coach entered the limit of an hour twenty.
So seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Kata's feet are flapped, helping her to the railings, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also luck from a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the goal.
Euphoria doesn't let us think about the push in the passages to the locker rooms.
Here you can see that the Goat Aisle was not the narrowest place.
This is the end of the embankment, which is under the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners stuffed to bursting.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for them.
Even I lose my head after a while and wonder if the beautiful views and compared to previous years the more interesting route was worth what is happening at the finish.
I know from my own experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people join it, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year's change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in Žluté lázně has been transferred between the runners and in the race itself.
The organizers around the track and random spectators escalated it on every metro track.
Unfortunately, when running through the historic center, obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of the mass race in a place that is on the one hand bounded by the wall and on the other by the river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a run through the goal, I rate it as very successful.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write us in the discussion if you liked the route and what you think about the situation at the finish.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison staff in Bulgaria participated in a nationwide protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov, is also higher salaries.
The Peacekeepers symbolically protested the month against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the unions of the prison guards and the representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"Negotiations are still ongoing," said Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of the Prison Service.
Members of the Federation of Employees' Union Workers' Organizations at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of the prison service's staff staff staff staff.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we can't see them
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University managed to hit the black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for the layman to penetrate the bias of the problems that many theoretical physicists today deal with – an effort to unite the two perfectly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the causes of the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the case of searching for a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
The physical problem between two key theories (for at the moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and solves so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even to the laymen.
In addition, Greene handled the complex material so fresh and engagingly that he could not be blamed for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he largely corrected his "error" in two more books: the structure of the universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book becoming more obsolete, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little more vivid in this area (for the fact that the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter Green's non-violently open door to the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us avert our eyes from the universe as a whole for a while to something more grounded, specifically a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you stretch the hundred-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watch the whole scenery from a half-kilometer distance (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily record a long in a horizontal direction of a stretched hose, but if you do not suffer from austrosightedness, you can hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which to walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at the moment, you answer them with just one indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a half-kilometer distance a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we will suddenly see the second dimension - in the shape of a circle-wracking hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/anti-clockwise movement", that is, around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant you have to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where there is a wrapping hose on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note. Experts will point out that this chapter focuses purely on the disorder theory of strings.
Chapter 12 and 13 discusses the indisturbance aspects.)
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long long longitudinal dimension is represented by a direct arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked with a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the wrapped circuit of the hose is short, "rolled" and harder to notice.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates the important feature of spatial dimensions.
That they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, vast, and therefore directly noticeable, or, on the contrary, small, coiled and much less observable.
Of course, in this case, we did not exactly avoid being able to reveal the "saint" dimension of the hose-covering thickness.
All you had to do was take the binoculars to help.
But if the hose were thinner-like hair or capillary-a filing, we would only reveal a shrived dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein an article in which he came out with the stunning idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three of the dimensions known to all of us.
Kaluza justified his radical claims by providing an elegant and persuasive framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptuality structure.
Immediately, the question arises as to how this observation of Kaluz goes together with the obvious fact that we see exactly three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly expressed and clareded by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and shrewd dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the direction of the hose length, our universe has a large, vast and lightly visible three dimensions, the existence of which we realize every moment.
But analogically with the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, firmly coiled into space so tiny that they have so far remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatuses.
To get a clearer picture of the nature of Kaluz's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a little longer.
Imagine that on the perimeter of the hose we draw a relatively dense row of circles in black paint.
Appearances look like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, thanks to the drawing, we will now reveal the writy dimension even more easily, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited, and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, together four space-steammen.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help your imagination a little, let us note the illustration in Figure 3; it shows two great dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we increase the view of the geometry of the space in a similar way as we have enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them on the fourth level of magnification) if they are shrines into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square network depicts the commonly known "large" dimensions, while the circle represents a new, tiny and coiled dimension.
Just like loops of threads in a densely woven carpet, even these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we just drew them for illustrations only into intersections in a square network.
The background of Figure 4 depicts the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - on such common standards as meters, depicted by the side of a small square in a square network.
In each following image, we focus on the small area of the image of the previous one; we will enlarge it to become visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see on the first few levels of magnification.
However, if we advance on our way to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we will see a sudden new, in the shape of a circle-scrunted dimension, similar to the loops of the thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions, similar to the circular circuit at every point in its length.
In the interest of lustration, we have only drawn the circular dimension in some, regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space summarises.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-fold-fold spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has a large dimension of only one.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just about an object within the universe, perhaps our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly closed dimension is extremely miniature, recognizing it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - much heavier than to observe the obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our state-of-higher tools to increase.
But the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not just a rounded bump inside the normal size, as a two-dimensional illustration misproves.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point in three common vast dimensions.
It is the dimension on the other three dimensions independent in the same place as the dimensions of the above-down, from the left-right and from the front-back independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and we would need four data to determine its position, in addition to the usual position in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data five, in any case, one more than we would normally expect.

To our surprise, we find that even if we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz and Klein’s reasoning show that this does not exclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe can easily have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-of-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large billionth of a billionth of a meter.
Smaller shrewd dimensions can hardly be observed.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluz idea with several ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
Its calculations indicated that an additional circular dimension could be a size of approximately one Planck length, i.e. a size far beyond the distinctiveness of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional tiny spatial dimensions by Kaluz-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to practice electric guitar: part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" consists of a twelve-act harmonic form, which you can freely repeat.
Those who are groping in music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
Educational puppeteer and puppet conductor, whose Facebook profile can be followed here, has been working as a graphic designer since graduation twenty years ago.
She is a guitarist of the band Wohnout, from whom she is said to not be able to leave.
The guitarist is after his father, as well as brother Matěj, the leader of the Wohnus.
Start training on one string.
"The Rhythmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, you just need to apply it to a harmonious model of the twelve," advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what can be imagined with the twelve-on-line harmony on two strings and how nice it is already starting to sound.
If you gain the third string, you can already flirt with a melody some songs.
When you finally add a fourth, beware of the change of tuning, Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonics and try to put it together with twelve.
Exercise her honestly.
As best, you can read in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It is not for a great celebration, acknowledges Dvorak from Hradec Králové
We take the point and we like it.
The first half we had more chances, the second home side," said the striker, who scored from a penalty kick this time.
Were you nervous when he was playing, after all, he was accompanied by a huge whistle?
Somehow I didn't really notice it, although on the second goal, where the home fans are, it would probably be worse.
You equalized with the penalty after half an hour, but you also got the goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We overslept the beginning, we were passive, the corner came from it and then a penalty.
After that, you got up and the first half you were the better team that had more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that after the goal we played well until the break.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to keep the pace of play after it, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the home team said something about their game during the break, they probably weren’t very happy with it.
On the pitch of the opponent you only scored for the first time, while you may not have scored a goal at home.
Why is it that difference?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it's more about us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen is a different category.
Four games you were waiting for a goal, weren't you afraid it could be similar after the last game?
Not even, but of course we are glad that since last game we do not have to talk about waiting for a goal.
Now we have added another without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet for a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a kilometer away crater.
The lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun region near the Vatnajökull glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a kilometre away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as a part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most...
For the time being, the situation remains constant.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still travels from the crack about the same amount of lava.
Compared to the original estimates, however, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open even in places where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge flooding, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum River and on other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulfur in the vicinity of the eruption, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimvörðuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are also a lot more gases," says vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
The traces of the sandstorm were washed away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange stage (second highest) applies to Bárðambungu and yellow (third) for Askja.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked along the wings
Aerial day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, aerobatic Peggy Walent, who climbed out of the cockpit to the bar on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings in flight was introduced.
There it is reliant only on the strength of the muscles.
The air day in Cheb took place for the fifth time this year and the organizers once again managed to prepare several interesting aerial pieces.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was made not only by the "walking on the wings" performed by the German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also by the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or the Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention to himself with his bright cover.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After World War 1, many former war pilots tried to enforce this.
But due to the large number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the program of the air days.
Peggy climbs from the cockpit to the upper wing after the start.
He performs various exercises there.
Towards the end of the performance, she moves to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," said Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main nail of the program, then the following performance of the Mustang fighter was the famous icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter jet swept onto the surface with the Grippens of the Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called on the numbers).
Let's see this line-up for the first time in the Czech Republic was seen by air fans.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone a breathtaking acrobatics with an aircraft from 1945.
He was still made during the war, but he probably never took part in it.
It was included in the military reserves.
He has been working in the civilian sphere since 1963.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Mnichovo Hradiště.
There is also another pearl of the Cheb Air Day, the twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, the massive machine could not be overlooked.
His polished aluminum cover shone into the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colours of the French Air Force has also gained admiration.
A small airliner took a renouncable Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation for an air day from Hof, Germany.
German neighbours in Cheb showed off reconstructed aircraft Jak 18T or three-member Bücker Jungmann biplane formations.
Lucie Borhyová: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
Lucie Borhyová exchanged parental worries at least for tonight for the work.
Stress or nervousness - blonde moderator clearly doesn't know any of it.
The moderation of the TV news went well for her, as if she hadn't stopped with him for two months!
It’s only two weeks since the blonde ended the six-week period in which women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
Lucie, however, will not be regularly shown in TV Nova's main news session.
According to Blesk.cz, the regular return is not until a month later.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs her more than TV viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit in the black.
An exhibition in Prague for a year?
The hall would sell out, plans bachelor party Jagr
It would be worthy if something like this was done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union stands up to it," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called Golden Match, in which the breathtaking nagano team met again.
Even the players who participated in the golden hat-trick.
The players would like it, right?
Definitely.
It would be a good idea to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, one-two days can be found during the tournament, when it is complete free and where such a match could be mixed.
We will tell Gum (Jiří Šlégr) or Béďa Shcherban (the organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey playoffs?
Well, if I fly in...
You don’t want to play in the national team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow alter your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and the performances are decisive in the national team.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Championships.
There should be players who have it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you enjoy the Nagano reunion?
The meeting with the players was great.
You've revived the stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
The most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlinka.
And it is good to remind the history of our hockey and that one generation is leaving, which was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Do you still remember your first representative match?
Such things are not forgotten.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three youngsters: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we played in one three.
It was the first representative start for everyone.
Well, that we would do some way, we can't say that.
Dominik Hašek was catching in Jihlava after a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
The Hashan never surprises me on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can not (Hašek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to finish in the national team).
Hnilička also showed himself great.
He was trained with me one night and he was leaky.
And now he was catching fabulously.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, footballers start qualifying
On Monday morning, prominent guests flocked to the NH Hotel in Smíchov.
People could see goalkeeper Petr Cech from Chelsea, national coach Pavel Vrba...
And there, the character in the black cap, that's Tomáš Rosický!
The Arsenal midfielder and the national team captain arrived at the reunion around half past eleven among the last.
We have a great game against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn’t be looking forward to?” said when he had already appeared in the national team in front of journalists.
Program of the Czech national team
Monday, September 1: start of reunion, first training
Tuesday, September 2: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autograph session (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of the meeting
Rosicky and Co. can support fans before Wednesday's game against the USA (20:15).
The team opened Tuesday's training, which starts at Letná at 18:30.
And it will be followed by an autograph session, which Rosický and Czech will not be missed.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be calmer.
This is praised by coach Vrba, who complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have a player together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been so much time for until now," said Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech football team will be accompanied by a musketer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The representation has three matches under Vrba, all preparatory.
She drew with Norway and Finland 2:2 and lost to Austria 1:2.
However, these results were not yet important.
That's only now.
The match against the Netherlands will kick off the qualification for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if they could also manage a rehearsal against the USA.
The first half of the year was for us to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player of the twenty-three-member nomination to have health problems is forward David Lafata.
He's suffering from temperature.
If he did not manage to make his head to Wednesday's match against the USA, coach Vrba would call one more striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she would die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she had only a few years left to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The CMT UK charity organization said that a bad diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because very little is known about the disease.
Approximately 23 000 people are believed to suffer CMT in the UK, which can be manifested in motor skills such as muscle weakness, clumsy gait and twisted toes.
In the case of those affected, numbness or pain may also occur, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich ataxia (FA) - a disease that had a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be confiscated into a wheelchair, and she was dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two, who is now 51, says: "As a child, I knew that I can't do the same things as the others.
I fell down every day and it took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with other kids, and at school I was bullied because of the way I used to walk and run.”
When Rodgers was thirteen and she was after several surgeries to release her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she took advantage of the fact that her doctor had left the room, and peered into her dossing where she learned that she was suffering from the FA.
“I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, I was absolutely panicked.
I thought that before I was eighteen, I would end up in a wheelchair, and before I was twenty-five, I would be dead, and in the meantime, I would gradually lose all my powers.
I was all alone and I was planning a funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk hadn't deteriorated as much as she had anticipated, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her and said, "Gold, I don't think you have the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it will be something much less dangerous to life.”
After undergoing several genetic tests, it was discovered that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a child of fortune," she said.
The CMT UK charity organization has launched a month of CMT awareness to draw attention to the disease.
Washington businessmen: with economic turnover, taxes are rising
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new poll published last week, state and local taxation of companies in the country with accumulating the recovery of the economy rose slightly last year, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia together for the fiscal year 2013 went to state and local coffers for $27.6 billion, up 3.8% higher than $26.6 billion off in 2012.
The tax burden – both state and local – rose 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year, and was the third consecutive year in years 2009 and 2010, when taxes were down.
According to a study conducted by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased more rapidly, 4.3% than local levys, 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56 per cent of the business tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, shows proportionately the smallest tax revenue from business.
The researchers say that the majority share of the growth in tax revenue comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which increased property taxes by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years with a rise of -1%.
Although most of the profits come from major states like California, New York and Texas, the same seems to be in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid over $10 billion in both state and local property taxes last year, up from an annual increase of 4.2% compared to $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, an obvious increase in the value of real estate does not drive up so much state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than a fifth of the company’s taxes.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., property tax accounts for nearly half of state and local taxation.
“In Maryland, he owns a lot of company real estate, especially the tax base around D.C., the government or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, chief executive of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from business cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business revenues also appear to be increasing.
Companies in the region have disclosed $2.3 billion in corporate income tax, which increased from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raised one billion dollars in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing just as fast in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below the average, to 4.1%.
Of all three districts (all of which have the same taxation), Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax, 6%.
The rate of taxation of companies in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and an overall more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study did not evaluate.
Despite this advantage, Virginia is facing pressure from competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law lowering the company's tax rate from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory rate of income taxation could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small business owners in Washington are doing better and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Trade tax paid by retail entrepreneurs as personal income tax - the structure of compensation for cost increases by increasing prices, according to which most firms are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say the trend and national increase in the trade tax is likely to continue next year, the total tax revenue from sales for both state and local governments will increase to 6.2% in the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington, however, may lag behind others because cutting state spending is levying its labour market tax.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorussia and Lafat's scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin calls for talks on Novorussia
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government troops have clashed with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that they will have a difficult return to the Russian market after the current anti-Russian sanctions regime.
According to him, the support that the West is being made by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
According to him, the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is to propose within a week the form of further hardening of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU summit decided last night.
Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent president of the meeting of member countries, told journalists.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for the shift in the form of sanctions should be prepared already on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye to replace in December
At the European Union summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to head the European Council, the so-called EU President, who manages the summits of member countries.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
Catherine Ashton will be led by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian, who will thus become the vice-president of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it is just not talked about
Help an incurable and long-term suffering patient with leaving life?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legally possible.
Nevertheless, the statements of the doctors who approached the LN show that they hear about such requests.
ALS: The toughest chapter of neurology, says doctor about sclerosis
The Czech Republic suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerososis (ALS) approximately three hundred people, 21 patients undergo experimental stem cell therapy in Motol, Prague.
We definitely don't know if it's going to be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a Motols neurologist.
It shows the manuscript of the CIA, they needed war, writes Huml about shooting down flight MH17
ČSSD MP Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "hard sanctions, which were declared in view of the downing of a civilian plane with almost 300 dead, were intentionally caused by the Ukrainian army."
According to the lawn, this shows the CIA manuscript.
Unfulfillable promises.
Elections are coming and the parties are again offering the impossible
After homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and cable car above Prague.
Before every election, this is repeated: parties promise the impossible.
Also now, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are competing to see who will appeal to the voters more.
Lidovky.cz has selected unfulfillable promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
A fierce siege has begun
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Liška consistently asked for the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side eventually complied and classified the ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the power of German troops.
SUM: Pilsen leads the league in front of Prague's "S", Liberec declassed Baník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, which leads by a point ahead of both Prague "S".
The changes at the head of the table were caused by the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the domestic league, thanks to two Lafat's hits defeated Jablonec.
A record win in the year was credited to Liberec, which was shot by Baník Ostrava 6:0.

How to survive a return from vacation?
Don’t rush and get a sleep
The last days of the holidays are ahead of us.
Getting used to getting used to a sunny beach or cottage at a normal working pace can be a challenge for many.
It can even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with the changed situation: not to rush and indulge in quality sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: "We keep our fingers crossed"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days, since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said she was not losing hope that an eighty-one-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We keep our fingers crossed for her.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency services, according to which she had a cardiac arrest on the Yorkwill endoscopy in the Upper East Side, according to the source.
Doctors deliberately maintain it under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of its condition, which remains “serious”.
Reactions were not long in coming, including incredible support online from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is twisted headlines
That the media with its headlines distorts reality is (unfortunately) no news.
I know that headlines "sold" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that many are so-called "readers" who do not read anything else.
And this is a fact that has been bothering me very much lately, the more apt is more annoyed by the word.
This is particularly true of articles about the conflict of Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines of "Israel has attacked Gaza" are quite common.
It is only in the text that you will read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the fired missiles from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
This will then be the headline "Both sides violated the ceasefire".
Does the journalistic community realize that its actions are directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are increasing across Europe (and not only there)?
Sixty years have passed since the end of World War 2.
There are still people who survived Shoah.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans of the "Jewish swine" and similar distrust, it stunned me.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews they were destined for liquidation by the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen journalists, please give a little more care to your work.
You are often referred to as "watchdogs of democracy."
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech nation will be eliminated and the Czech Republic removed from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live on the territory of the state of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don't go among "yours", for example, to Gaza, answer you, why would they do it?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top health care (I have seen with my own eyes how to go to the top private hospital Hadassa, which is funded by sponsorship donations from Jews from all over the world, usually go to the top private hospital of Hadassa, which is financed by sponsorship donations from around the world, as well as Arabs and are treated there, of course).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with their missiles.
Gaza’s only real aid, and thus this troubled region, is to rid Hamas and disarm it.
And not condemning Israel, albeit indirectly in headlines.
Tell us about Hamas's practices, about its abuse of people as human shields.
Tell us that Hamas aims to liquidate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Notify that Hamas is on the list of the world's terrorist organizations.
Inform that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, the area could have been flourishing thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which Gazan administrators do not pay and even get angry that the power supply is sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide bombers could penetrate them on the territory of Israel, but perhaps into the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would have been much better.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed the information claim from Monday morning: an online retailer - a video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying a video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion.
The announcement sparked surprise not because no one expected anyone to buy Twitch, but because it was expected that YouTube would be the buyer.
Three months ago, Google's Twitch sales for one billion looked certain, and the connection seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago by Justin.tv, had a footing with the live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online from games on it - the words Business Insider "YouTube for live gaming."
Interaface Twitch.
YouTube already popular videos "Let's play", are a kind where sagingrs (mostly older) give games the Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes a lot when describingTitche, so the news that YouTube is buyingTwitch didn't bother anyone much, it was a textbook example of how an established company pays off as possible competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: “We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, it has the same values and a long-term vision, and wants to help us meet it faster.”
Another mystery is - honestly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they prefer to do sports than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about, just watch the game instead of real playing.
It's one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder at three o'clock in the morning, how to play Resident Evil, and a completely different thing is to watch someone else get twenty hits in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today's, most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so watching their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe to get a headache.
I admit that speed run games in which Rogers Bannissters of our electronic time finish the game in record time is fun.
But if someone is not a master of acting or humor, their Twitch channel will probably not be very interesting.
But what do sceptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon use it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will blend into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as if it had been swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: hordes of young men who advertisers want.
As the director of Twitch Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, “believes in the future of the games,” and the media doesn’t seem reluctant, not even like a swallow—spectators.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American aeist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy Scriptures are God's Word."
Attached the original video.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are at odds with their religion, they often put us in front of the question: Who will you believe?
To God's proper word, or the word of man?
As if human exploration were completely vague compared to the authority they imagine that their doctrine has.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to the "word of God," they refer to the myths about the god enrolled by people.
If indeed there is an intelligent with a creator with a purpose, then he is the one who has created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be him who has devised the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be him who has delivered more and more evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion down to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It's like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabul.
And it was the people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by humans, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were not written by anyone other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there was indeed a true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergentius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of that greatness ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, a single scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors would not be able to compete with such work.
And people would not have to believe it blindly, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal the deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to the unity of common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the finite truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all of them are constantly decaying into more and more separate denominations, seeking questionable truths, and each one in some way claims God’s leadership, regardless of the continued running and separation in every way.
Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Quran, the Bahá'u'lláh's Kitab-I-Akadāsa, Zarathuštrov Avesta, Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered "absoluble truth" and the "appenous word of the only true god"
The only logical explanation is probably that they are all at astray to some extent.
None of the above books have any advantage over others.
None of them have evidence, and none can be confirmed historically.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I am not saying that the Bible is reliable and historical.
Of course it's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologies (advocates) because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities and primitive notions once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said to be proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are said to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - with each of them also containing a prophecy that was not fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion have been written with human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and perspectives of their primitive and often prejudices of politically motivated authors, thereby explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it contradiction, rather mutual comments.
We have to point out again that we have two different authors, whose work has somehow been mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not an eyewitness story!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. the five Books of "Moses" and not to give Moses authorship any of them, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezdras) of several mutually unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished basis of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by doquettes and ebionics and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups, like the luciferians, were dispersed and discredited by other revisions of the Bible.
One of these arrangements refers to King Ugarit, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young Mozišek religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mountain" turned into Beelzebug "Loth of the Flies".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened through the New Testament was Canonized in the 4th century A.D. in a series of commission decisions at the assembly in the Nikay.
The four Gospels were adopted, and sixteen others were rejected by simply raising their hands, as if the reality of any matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after the Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the same time in the Roman Church?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same evangelical stories.
Thus, the core of the canon evolved from the narrow of the early Church.
So the Council simply accepted as a gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
But they also knowingly removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were reported to books that were approved.
Among the rejected items we find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the true author of this ardent mixer of legends, parables and psalm lyricists?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not too illumination, rather the opposite!
This is why such a large part of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in incantations, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology and five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would cure him of leprosy.
We talk about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats are birds and whales are fish, and pi is the whole number.
These people believed that if they show pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone know what to say about genetics?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know this.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, then it would contain no such errors as it contains.
If she came from the pen of a truly superior being and intended as literal history, then it would contain absolutely nothing of what it contains.
As a moral guide, he is totally failing because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who overlooked or promote cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence against children, abortion, pillage, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they are being done by the will of God.
But creationists are still ignoring all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is in conflict with the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have God.
There is one thing in their world and the other.
It is ironic that they reject God's "work" as "worshiping creation instead of the creator."
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and the god himself, and they even insist that the refutation of their supposedly "holy" books somehow refutes God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God may exist and the Bible might be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate the doctrine from the deity.
So it is a kind of idolatry, where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were God himself, because they think they are his word.
But God has never written or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people approved or rejected into their allegedly "immutable word" of any god was invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often also deliberately altered and twisted by mere flawed people.

An attacker in Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of them killed
A man named Chen, according to the New China news agency, violently broke into the elementary school building in the morning and attacked around half past eleven local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from above, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one offspring in accordance with the government policy.
Zeman showed the first-graders in Lány how he had to sit in school
The youngest schoolchildren were taken by the ninth graders, where he and the teacher waited for the president to arrive.
He then showed the children how he had to sit at school himself.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately that doesn't await you anymore, you're already single people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then handed over to the first-graders as a gift.
President Miloš Zeman is married in the first grade of elementary school in Lány.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek started the new school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to connect the Czech education system more with Czech sport," one of the reasons why the first day of school went to the north of Bohemia.
The school management approached him some time ago at a hockey match in Litvínov.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate in the start of the school year," the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year in a private sports school in Litvínov.
This year, 115 thousand first-graders joined the first grade.
A total of more than 850,000 children will attend primary schools and more than 405 thousand students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
The new art director of news Nova is David Fiala
David Fiala has become the new art director of news and journalism Nova since September 1.
In office, he will replace Alan Záruba, who led from 1. June creative department of the entire Nova Group.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphic department of the news broadcaster Z1.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he has been involved in the implementation of a complete visual transformation of the news sessions of the TV News, Střepiny, Prásk! and other journalistic programs of TV Nova.
David Fiala masters the synergy of communication between the editorial staff, studio management and the graphic department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
He has a feeling for typography and a clean sleek design, which is the path we want to continue to move on in the visual of Nova news," says Nova's creative director Alan Záruba.
Apple allegedly succumbed to hackers, nude celebrity images have been leaked to the public
Screenshot with leaked files listing
So far, an anonymous user on 4chan publishes both nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, according to the American news server Mashable.com.
It allegedly obtained them by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple’s servers, where affected users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities reject the images as rigged, but several of the affected authenticity have already admitted.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known as Katniss in the Hunger Games and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Death Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the obtained images and videos to enrich.
American magazines reportedly expressed interest in the footage, but according to reports on 4chan, the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it is very likely a weakness in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on the GitHub server that allowed to obtain passwords to user accounts through brute force, i.e. automatic repetition of login attempts with different passwords.
This tool worked demonstrably, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before the release of this instrument.
iCloud users should change their password associated with your Apple ID for precautions.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
Leakage of nude celebrity images to be a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google, or Microsoft are secured many times better than computers in homes or smaller businesses, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it only works on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you will be able to move the sensitive images "to safety" in time, and most importantly, you will have the space to delete unsuccessful images, so they will not unnecessarily occupy the space in the online storage.
We offer instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
A smart way to save on college scripts
Since the price of a university script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the upcoming second-year student has come up with a smart way to reduce costs.
He devised a system of lending books from classmates from higher-end editions offering nominal compensation to delay their divestment.
“I got a book for a calculation that normally costs $180 for a semester for ten and chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes online stores and creative solutions like Schroederovo.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the book, often at a significant discount than if they bought it.
Or Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores on campus sites, say borrowing books has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the industry shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Nee or Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbooks are bought in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Bookshops.
Here are 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosttler’s book is almost $290, but on the Internet it can be purchased at Chegg.com, in a retail store specialized in textbooks, to buy a new $239.99.
Buy used
If you do not mind other people's notes or wear and tear and vandalize, the appropriate option is the use of the teaching texts.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says on Amazon.com he paid 42 cents for the used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business Business."
The new one was sold for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, is proposing that students check their teachers to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes are not relevant for work in seminars.
If so, the older editions can be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering the borrowing of textbooks, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about twenty dollars for the whole semester.
Get apquahede to the terms and conditions of the store in which you borrow the book, including the penalty for notes, highlighting or wear and tear, and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don’t return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially lent in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon take the Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN, because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order the book over the Internet, make sure it is really in stock, Gault advises.
He was convinced of it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Muddy, all mud.
And then they found in the well torzo rifles from the end of the war
The well is located near the church of St. George.
We uncovered the vegetation around and began to pull out the age-old deposit - about a meter and a half mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay bottom, we came across the barrel," recounted Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found it was a torso of an attacking German rifle used by SS units.
The finding is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were made until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novák added.
All wooden construction things have decomposed over time, so it is unusable.
Her body, however, is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did he find himself in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe she was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS troops, probably out of fear of being pushed back.
Fascists on the run would probably not.
They were throwing away weapons in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing that enthusiasts from the Rainbow Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were already a lot of them all around, that's why we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully felt the mud so that some misfortune would not happen, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The find will end in the depository of the museum at the chateau in the nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech
Exclusive interview Aktuálně.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Sorry, I have to take it... they call me from Donetsk," Ukrainian Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise the director of the local Centre for the Liberation of Prisoners of War, also apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
With each such interrupt, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - which Ruban specifies with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk, and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in reserve, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests on the Maidan.
Just yesterday - when we were talking about the interview - he was in Donetsk.
He is freeing Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists twenty-four hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that Czechs are also fighting on the side of pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number of up to thirty.
But there can be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already freed the captured Serbs, the Dagestani, the Chechen, one Swede, the Georgian... but the Czech is not yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we came across your captured compatriot and be able to free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise Czechs who are joining pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers will capture them?
They should understand that if, as Czechs, they are fighting in Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy after the interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
The separatists consider these men to be a mercenary, and they say nothing deserves nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them even a Czech - they put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
The guy just survives.
The Ukrainian side is also acting like a state in the war.
Q: How many prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say it has long since exceeded a hundred men.
We stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we just freed them... they didn't save them from the war if they decide to continue the fighting.
The rescuers are doctors in war, surgeons, but we certainly don't.
That's the way it is.
And every day there are more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
It doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes even a simple human supplication is enough to release prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust among pro-Russian separatists... as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of both warring parties?
A tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "A mad general with steel balls."
It doesn't offend me.
And maybe it captures the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officers, I have gained some authority before.
I never cheat, I don't cheat and keep my word all the time.
No matter what happens, I act honestly and speak the truth.
Even if it is very unpleasant to the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk one.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they torture and kill them.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even captured me in exchanging prisoners... this job can mean the end at any time... I don't have to go back.
Q: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (long pause)... Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture of prisoners during the questioning.
Unfortunately.
And the executions?
They only take place on the Donetsk side.
I have no information about the fact that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
Nor hints that the Ukrainian army is committing something similar.
We have an idea of the amount of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give the numbers.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans of Afghanistan.
They are trying to take on independence and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs, and they are their irreconciliable opponents - for the life and to the death.
As we say, they were overtaken to their throats.
The same dreams and desires were shown by people on Maidan.
And now I'm specuating a little: Russia supports the separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be a big one and the other, on the contrary, to be a small one.
But this phrase of mine already hides an implacable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, do you see one of the toughest leaders of pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Whenever I cross the line of the war front, I am without a weapon and I show soldiers or armed soldiers spread their bare hands.
And I always have both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters in the crosshairs or in the optical sight.
I can always see the faces of the people who are at me.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, it's just as a little gubernia in a big Russian empire.
In any case, he constantly talks about it and considers Ukraine to be a kind of misunderstanding.
According to him, such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the discussion show of Ukrainian television, you have called your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk a weak, clueless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
For the three hundred meters of walking I always get at least five times fear.
So why should I keep a secret of the opinion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that it is detrimental to our country?
Q: Do you think he has a part in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians nickname Yatsenyuk "whiker".
And a rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians, of which fear or would have respect and authority with others.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister, he doesn't have the right to cry in parliament in a war, beg him, play his intrigues with him, threaten to put office... he must run the country, manage it, and protect it in times of war.
In case of threat to the country, the prime minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest on weeping emotions.
He is the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Yatsenyuk?
She behaves like a teenager.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... he does not fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
He should leave, then.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy failed to save sales
The expendable 3 of Sylvester Stallone returned from the $90 million budget in the U.S. less than $30 million and Sin City: A woman for whom I would return only $12 million from the 70 million budget.
The movie Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz earned only $14.6 million over the first weekend, and also movies for kids like How to Train Your Dragon 2 were disappointing for cinemas.
According to Robbie Collin's article in the Telegraph, the quality of children's films is to blame.
Collin described 2014 as the "worst" year of children's films, and called how to train a dragon 2 just a "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films deployed on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem is not necessarily in the quality of the movies themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average ratings of summer film premieres broadcast at least 2,000 cinemas in the period between the Day of Victims and 20. July 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both audiences and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is similar to the quality of last year's hits.
According to some commentators, change in viewer access and higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase what has already been.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood box office blockbusters, Netflix's profit has made $1.2 billion thanks to internet services, nearly twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comics rights, and predicting the "collapsmentation" of Hollywood.
In light of the current slumping, some commentators say that there may be something on his catastrophic prophecy.
With the launch of possible big box office blockbusters in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic Worlds, different numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
Producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently called the decline in revenues simply "cyclical." For the Hollywood Reporter, he said: "Next summer will be the biggest bark blockbuskers in history, and no one will worry about selling."
North Korea threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul announced.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang lies in the northwest of the DPRL near the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from a site in the northwest of the DPRK and flew to a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea appears to have launched a missile for the first time from Chagang province, South Korean media reported, citing army circles.
In the province, there is an underground launch pad for Scud rockets.
This is another in a series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile tests and artillery this year.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests were held by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the town hall in Cardiff for a meeting described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to the protesters who came from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TEN-year-old tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A sixteen-year-old girl and an eighteen-year-old man set off for a hike at the Govets Leap in Blackheath after noon on Sunday.
When they did not return home, the concerned relatives called the police around eight o'clock in the evening.
A search squad was sent, including local police and a rescue team, and the couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around eleven o'clock in the evening.
The girl injured his knee and the man fell and hit his head.
Police stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In stable condition, they were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win was on the foot of Vasicek
The 23-year-old forward could have decided, but he failed in two of his biggest chances.
After the goal, the shot called close up three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended up on the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Květoň.
I had it on my leg, I have to give that chances.
I'm angry with myself," Vasicek sprinkling ashes on his head.
"I guess I should have put it higher under the lid, it went down a bit," he mused.
The defense of Sigma did not allow Opava much, with the exception of Mikula's 11th-minute raid, which, however, was covered by the goalkeeper Reichl.
Then they started pushing the Hanáci, but they did not let them into the chances in the block defending the home side and the shots from a distance was caught by Květoň.
We compared ourselves for fifteen minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from the standard situations.
But Vasicek did not change the chance, and so it ended 0:0," regretted coach of Hanák Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava also took the point due to absences in the line-up, where, in addition to the pair of injured, Petr Vavřík and the three-goal scorer Petr Ševčík, who are visiting Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike its former policy, it did not allow them to take on.
Substitutes deserve an graduation.
Sigma was more football-like, but except for one standard, we didn’t let her do anything,” said Petr Baránek, the Silesian coach.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and belligerence.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma got to four points with a draw, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club Josef Lébr, who after the defeat to Znojmo conditioned his million-dollar contribution to the treasury by diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We realized Mr. Lébr's warning, so there can't be any talk about the boys not wanting to fight," Kalvoda noted, adding: "I believe it will come and when he scores a goal, he'll start to fall.
But after the first shot, I immediately replace him to save goals for the next games," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino twice impressed Venice.
Film Festival is otherwise experiencing a crisis
After a huge enthusiasm over the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu suddenly ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days indicated the impression that interest in the 71st annual Venice festival somewhat declined.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critics of the acclaimed, but less attractive films for viewers as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia of the 1960s The Perspective of Silence and Other Social Themes from American 99 homes to Iranian Stories, in cinemas simply remained empty seats.
Heroes from comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet besieged such crowds as in the past and has reportedly ceased to be a problem to get a last-minute seat in a hotel.
The crisis is talked about more in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has affected such esteemed institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not reflected in the lack of personalities, but present solely in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for autographs from comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who successfully played dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event for all generations became a visit to legendary actor Al Pacino.
He also shone in two films.
In the story of Out-of-competition, directed by Oscar-winning Barry Levison based on Philip Roth's novel, Pacino has a role close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as a weirdo brandy owner of a rural town in the film Manglehorn, shot by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actor Shouldn't Miss It - But Does the Artist of Pacin's Forpico's Forpice Needed Prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian one in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly proclaims the land from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italians
This year’s Italian film is doing very well in Venice.
The black souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman's first-picking, rewarded with a long applause.
The Kalabrian branch of the mafia is viewed by the view of family relationships between clans, which fight for power and money, and the director was able to harmonize all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, a camera, music and an actor.
He also attracted the attention of the chamber psychothriller The Hunger Hearts, filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who, through her miscarrying anxiety, almost kills her own child.
On the contrary, the French competition films were not warmly received by the ransom for fame, nor 3 hearts, both works clinging to the traditional model of consumer films, which rely on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really excellent films, Birdman and the Black Souls, are not so few for the first half of the festival.
And although the festival films generally have depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich's new film called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy out of the competition in Venice and shot in the style of the American merry-go-round of the 40's, managed to elevate the mood for more than a day.
Police officers caught four meth producers in Prague, drugs were driven from Poland
"In recent days, detectives have detained three men, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a twenty-five-year-old woman who produced and sold meth in Prague 9 from last November until August this year," police spokeswoman Jana Rössler said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihlářské Street caught a forty-two-year-old organizer and a dealer in one person and a young woman who was a drug buyer in Poland and a benefit seller in the group.
The following day, detectives detained another member of the group, on the basis of the prior consent of the prosecutor, a thirty-seven-year-old man.
The last of the four police officers caught on Wednesday morning on 20 August in the area of the Malešice incinerator," the spokeswoman said.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of competence.
In the workshop of the Letná complex, in a garden house in Horoměřice, in an apartment in Konevova Street and other places in Prague 9, he produced meth, procured various aids and chemicals needed for its production and ensure the transport of drugs with a pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the drug, divided into plastic bags and then sold meth.
A twenty-five-year-old, hitherto unpunished woman helped him transport medicines from Poland or sell addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rösslerová added.
On the basis of the judge's order, the criminals also carried out several house searches, where they provided the drug, industrial chemicals, digital scales, salary bags, syringes, tubing and other aids and items that can be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine, according to experts.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the available records, the police found that the main organizer had been punished a total of seven times since 1995 for property crimes, the woman was not criminalized by the court," the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was conditionally convicted of sexual misbearing in 2006 and a thirty-seven-year-old car mechanic who is being prosecuted at large was punished nine times since 2009.
It was also mostly for property crimes.
The investigator accused three men and the woman of committing the crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
For three persons, the investigator eventually filed a motion for the arrest of the custody, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokeswoman said.
The fourth defendant, a thirty-seven-year-old recidivist, ended up at large.
His position and role in this case were not as fundamental as for the other defendants.
Police continue to work with this man.
Ferrari offers chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things at a lot of "interesting" prices as part of its other products.
As a good example in Italy, for example, handmade chess with a play board of 42 x 42 cm will serve.
If you like it, prepare more than 40 000 CZK.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer gets a set of wooden black and red lacquered figures stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fiber.
It is probably no surprise that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a rearing horse.
If the chess does not seem like a sufficiently valuable gift, there is also a Ferrari 500 F2 made (by hand) in 1:1,8 scale, is also available.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Disturbance of grammar schools and secondary schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that grammar school students have a good job.
The start of the school year is here.
There have been great preparations in schools in the last fortnight.
Mostly it is about routine matters, such as transferring flower pots from the summer repository back to the classrooms and getting chalk.
They will have a little more frmol at the Hořice Grammar School.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature for the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year grammar school in Hořice opens after three years and renews its activities.
Not on a public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders are so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by the introduction to the register of schools managed by the Ministry of Education.
“French Socialists should shut up and get France right,” says Francois Hollande’s key ally
Valls is calling on the heavily fragmented left to “scarnage their support” to a combatively attuned socialist president whose new division of functions has not met with the consent of the majority of the French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said, violating the applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week, despite the affable conjecture by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who proposed at the beginning of the week to loosen the rules.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain "coherent" with the government.
But Christiane Taubir, Minister of Justice, made him a line over the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for “The French lost their faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the constant internal dispute between the Socialists, saying she did not assume that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls as well. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying she was convinced that it could win an early election to the party and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the European elections.
According to a Journal du Dimanche poll, 76 percent of French people think that the Socialist Party runs at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French will soon run out of patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and cut record unemployment.
“This is limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation,” he said.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer be limited by Prague until the elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved only by the new leadership of the capital.
There will be no more games room disappears from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections, and the city will not restrict street art.
The walking of dogs will not be limited.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees before the October elections.
"In addition, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, which is ending in a few weeks' mandate," said Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Several town halls have decided to abolish gambling across the board in its territory in recent weeks, such as Prague 5 and 7.
But the gambling halls will not disappear, the gambling decree will not change yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the elections.
Now we would not even technically manage to do so, for example, the deadlines for submitting comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment of the decree, will take place on September 11.
The referendum on the blanket ban on gambling is planned on the day of the municipal elections of the city districts of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Gambling is currently prohibited, for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not change even in the case of street art, the so-called busking.
This is especially complained about by Prague 1, which has already sent the municipality a proposal of places that would like to extend the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Anděl.
The city has been preparing a decree regulating dog walking for several months, it has not yet been completed.
The location of the casinos and the issue of busking is dealt with by city ordinals.
They can only be issued or modified by the City Council.
Town halls have only an advisory voice, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, victory placed victory for proponents of Scottish independence at their fingertips
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of doing this mistake for the third time when she nearly placed on billboards across Scotland the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you can't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, or gaining their respect when you start threatening them.
The morale of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots have a far greater tendency to expel currency exchangers from the temple than to let them dictate from them how to vote.
Scottish nationalist chief Alex Salmond knows this well, so he repeatedly asked his opponent, unionist Darling, in a televised discussion, whether he is willing to respect the "superforant will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence and start supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and with a grimace, he fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish electorate.
But the debate about Scotland’s currency will be more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and defense of the state health care that citizens have for free.
Darling backed London bankers on the currency, giving the impression that he would not protest the privatization of the health care.
As Salmond said, "He got into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to the voters, but to the association of "boss", to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent domestic.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish First Minister.
At least Cameron was able to say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country."
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost a physical pain.
What he says is clear: The scats are not to pop up and must accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
The pessimistic beginning of the school according to Miloš Urban
Illustration of the short story The longest year
Miloš Urban The Longest Year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that was nowhere near and we just rolled around and we just spat and swirled with the granny summer, the silence before the storm, the calm before the stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, for the fifty-fifth time, the sanchback of the mountain around Imperial to the back of Vary, somewhere near the tennis courts, there was no heat, the sun was stroking the back and shoulders, tapping the rays at the farewell.
In the evening, a slight nervousness, still a holiday regime, to sleep at half past eleven, in a week it will be worse, the moments before falling asleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then get up at half past seven in the morning.
It's Monday.
It usually doesn't rain, on the contrary, summer is maliciously sneering in front of the school.
To come in a ghostly light on a slice and feel like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there is the school, the ZDŠ A.
Zápotocký with monstrously pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new, boys taller, girls busty.
There are thrazed guys, they avoid, as is interesting how unmistakably they stick together and how early they are here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came jinxed are now laughing at something hysterically, probably something changed in their lives over the holidays, while with me everything is the same.
And new first-graders, some nervous and others excited, why are they even coming here?
Because they have to, educational wards.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, an annoyed janitor with a mop, unfortunately, still the same thing that is said to lend the pupil a key from a tin box, where you can leave textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dressing rooms remains in the memory, now it does not take place, it is nicely aired, but in a week it will be worse.
The idea alone is the stomach clenching and the head begins to ache.
A head that even worse embraces math curriculum, that diabolical play for the elect, which I do not belong to and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, the other fives, hide before trying, fit into the bench and best to subliminate, to be there, to exist only as a name in the sorting, and dreaming stories about more beloved girls and nicer buildings, about antennas into space, where no one competes with anyone, humiliates anyone and does not strandle anyone.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
The new daughters were left to die.
She faces an exceptional punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the cabin of public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, a little girl was born, whom she wrapped in a prepared blanket after cutting her umbilical cord, hid under her jacket and carried her to a road feeder, where she put her in shrubs located a few tens of meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
It probably came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus I needed to go to the bathroom, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
I cut the cord cord with scissors, which I wore to school," the defendant described, adding that she was ashamed of the pregnancy.
"The following day she returned to the place, put the child's body in a backpack and took it away, removed the body from her backpack, wrapped in a black plastic bag and hid and left under the staircase in her grandmother's house in Havlíčkův Brod," the lawsuit says, adding that it was not entirely clear when the newborn's death occurred.
It could have been in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after giving birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or when placed under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from a non-displaced umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman, in an undetermined time from February to 12 April, when the child's corpse was found by random witnesses under a bushes near the pond in the Havlíčkův Brod region, she herself secretly gave birth.
This time in the bathroom of an attic apartment in a family house.
Without verifying whether it was born alive without cutting and tying the umbilical cord that was wrapped around its neck, putting the baby in several plastic covers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Subsequently, in the afternoon, he and his then partner took him to the pond.
She was eventually reported by a friend
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of the partner.
For this reason, he is not now standing trial, only he was punished for his transgression against the Funeral Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like the fact that he's not punished as an accoster.
He manipulated the child against my wish.
I know my solution was not right, but it seemed like a human at the time," the defendant, who allegedly succumbed to the man in the relationship and was afraid of him, said.
In the course of her testimony, the young woman spoke fairly evenly.
Tears were driven into her eyes only when she spoke about her relationship with her parents, from whom she herself left after reaching the age of majority.
She didn't want to kill
"She comes to me every 14 days to visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn't buy equipment because I didn't want children, I felt young.
I still wanted to put it in a baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do it.
I can't explain that to you," she replied to the judge.
However, she denied acting deliberately and intention of killing the newborn.
The second child, according to her claim, was born dead.
Even during her pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I have also restricted smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was seen in both cases, she told everyone on repeated questions that she had health problems, that she was in aundremitted.
And that's my friend.
The main trial will continue in the court in Hradec Králové on Tuesday with the testimony of forensic experts.
A verdict could already be handed down on Wednesday.
The woman is threatened with a penalty of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise closes to three billion Prestige Cruise repurchase
According to sources familiar with the whole affair, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. has advanced. (NCHL.O), the third-largest cruise operator in the world, in negotiations to buy Presige Cruises International Inc. for approximately three billion dollars.
The trade by Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company competing with a larger competition by Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), have enabled access to luxury Prestige Cruises and wealthy clients.
The deal may be released as early as this week, a source revealed on Sunday, but warned that negotiations still may not end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a twenty percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want to be named because the negotiations were not public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, and a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise, headquartered in Miami, operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's income in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.

Companies are competing to make these customers the preferred option for the selection of cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public offering in January 2014 with U.S. regulators.
Apollo has had a majority stake in the company since 2007 since the closing of the deal worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has been in its current form since 2000, when it came to merge with the cruise operator owned by the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure businesses and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested one billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise launched shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the marketing authorisations at the end of June, Genting owned the capital share of 28%, Apollo 20% and private equity firm TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the first public tender's registration dossier, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise include 82% of North American passenger volumes.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong one day after vote decision provoke Chinese authorities
Near was a group of people loyal to Beijing waving the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Commission of the National People's Congress approved only two of the three candidates to take part in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first receive the support of the appointment committee, which is likely to consist of members of the loyal Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for the opposition Democrats to get on ballots and get pro-democratic activists to renew the promise and cripple the Hong Kong financial center protests by the “Occupation of the Central” movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tensions, with Chinese leaders fearing that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June outlining China's official authority in Hong Kong, Democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands marched into a city business district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be attended by Prime Minister Li, is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, Zhang Ronghsun, and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong Office and Macau Feng Wei were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather in the afternoon outside the office of the government of Hong Kong.
By the last days of the colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open talks on 'state sovereignty'
According to a description of the events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday asked that the Ukrainian government stop the fighting with the separatists in the east of the country and immediately began negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the breakaway areas.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin, with his remark, did not intend to indicate that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed in order for the Russian-speaking region to be given the authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to act with pro-Russian rebels as equals the apparent strategy, according to which they follow the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help the separatists occupy territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Neo-Russian independence so that he can connect with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the first channel of state television, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to reclaim the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken over by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists recently called the occupied territory "Novorusia" or "New Russia," a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian news agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words that "prisoner is an illusion" by anyone who believes that peace negotiations are on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians started 26 before the parliamentary elections. October campaigns, while government troops attack the civilian population in areas controlled by separatists.
“In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately initiate meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of state sovereignty of the southeast of Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s allusion to state sovereignty was meant in the context of a broader autonomy that has been under discussion of Kiev’s leadership for months and is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas of threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman's spokesman, who was supposed to correct the "wise interpretation" of Putin's remarks, stressed Russia's leadership's approach to addressing the separatist's uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two-million-strong population originally belong to ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and the polls that took place before the conflict have shown broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin a de facto control over the territory that would connect the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula annexed five months ago is the seat of the main Russian naval fleet, the naval business facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov- Crimea are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko during his inaugural address of 7. June, he proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy is very different from the vision of the Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to act with separatists as equals followed the next advance of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously quiet area along the Sea of Azov penetrated into eastern Ukraine.
The separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk by such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is a campaign to occupy the strategic coastal territory to Crimea.
This hastened a huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching the point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council on Saturday told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk region last week to support besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Greck are also involved in the scandal of uncovered photos
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancee Gabi Greck and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is shocked after a series of explicit photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence came online in the biggest celebrity hacked scandal.
The hacker claims to have sixty photos with naked Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greck were reportedly leaked to the public.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential magazine: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and distributed to the public.
Greco, which is now in New York, told online newspapers that the hack was “unshy” and those who have become targets “alike humiliation.”
It is thought that the hacker received thirty photos of Palmer with former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures on which the upstairs is hovering by the pool.
Palmer, for example, appeared in the film Love and Honor, where her counterpart was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the TV series Chuck Strahovski and the actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen films yesterday.
Lawrenc's representative TMZ said: "This is a clear violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on Twitter: "It's exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma footballers reeked up Lébra, even without a win
Olomouc - Thunders and lightning, which the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week, seem to be a thing of the past.
In the end, they brought only a point from Opava for a goalless draw.
By putting on and fighting, they've made the club boss a little bit.
Payout money could soon come to the club.
"I'll keep one more game, as I talked about it last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lébr confirmed that despite Sigma not winning, the players convinced him with an improved performance.
The fight and commitment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I am able to forgive that he will not win.
If we had played like that since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet," says Lébr.
Sigma in Opava withstood the opening pressure of the home team, then leveled the game and in the second half it was better.
After the victory, Kalvoda's charges reached, but they did not make their options to the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not to our liking.
To the full satisfaction, however, we lacked only one transformed chance," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the approach of the footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the side of the coach or the fans," Lébr said.
Sigma must take into account the pressure
After the match in Opava, the players did not want to comment too much on last week's event.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to admit it," the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
Completely without comment, the question of Lébr's statement last week was left by striker Václav Vasicek, who did not convert the biggest opportunity of Sigma in Saturday's match.
But then he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We'll still be under pressure.
Everyone wants to pull on us.
Today we showed that if we fight and ride everyone on their ass, it will go," he said.
Warnings were taken to heart
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hide the fact that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was obvious that Mr. Lébr's warnings were taken to heart.
Even before, it wasn’t about wanting to fight and they sloppy,” the Olomouc coach said.
It was the first fifteen minutes.
It took us to cope with the hardness and realise what the second league was about.
That it's not just about football, but mainly about the combativeness," Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that Sigma will work in the next matches from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe it," he added.
